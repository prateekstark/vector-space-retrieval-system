<TEXT>
 In a will signed the night before his execution, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> asked that his body be cremated and the ashes spread over <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state's <LOCATION> Cascade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, where at least four of his victims' bodies were found, a newspaper reported. The will prepared by <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s civil attorney, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, was released by <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> officials Wednesday at the request of The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, which reported the story in Thursday's editions. `` <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> will contact family and friends as to any services.

The will did not give a specific location for the ashes, and attempts by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to reach Ms. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> by telephone were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, co-owner of the Williams-Thomas Funeral Home in <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s body was sent, would not give details about the final disposition of the body because of an agreement with Ms. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>. `` There will be no public funeral as of right now,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` We do not believe there will be a public funeral in the future.'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was executed Tuesday at <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> State Prison near <LOCATION> Starke </LOCATION> for the February 1978 murder of <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, 12, of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

He was suspected in as many as 15 rapes and murders of young women in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> while he lived in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area in the mid-1970s. Four of his victims' bodies were found on <LOCATION> Taylor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> in the foothills of the Cascades. In the typewritten will, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> gave Ms. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> control over his remains, personal property and assets, including mail sent to him at the prison. Prison records show <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s personal property included a radio with a headphone, a gold-tone chain with a cross, a religious book, stationery, a gold wedding band and a bottle of suntan lotion. He also had $ 709.66 in cash, money donated by family and friends for snacks and other items from the prison canteen. The items were inventoried Tuesday and picked up at the prison by Ms. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Macmaster </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Volusia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s who visited him often in recent years, was designated to handle the arrangements if Ms. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> was unable to do so

<HEAD>With PM-Heartland-Steel Town Revival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Here are some facts about the steel industry, provided by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. They represent reports from 25 companies representing 80 percent of the industry. _ Profits-Losses: The nation's steel industry is expected to post a 1988 profit of about $ 2 billion. In 1987, profits were $ 1.02 billion, following losses of almost $ 12 billion in 1982-86. The rising profits are attributed to a general strengthening in the world steel market and a moderate increase in demand. _ Shipments: Domestic steel mill shipments are estimated to have risen from 76.7 million tons in 1987 to about 83 million tons in 1988 _ an 8.2 percent increase. _ Production: Raw steel production jumped from 89.2 million tons in 1987 to almost 100 million tons in 1988 _ a 12 percent increase. _ Employment: Average industry employment in 1988 was 170,000, slightly above the 1987 average of 163,000, the lowest since the institute started keeping records in 1933. The industry posted a record-high employment of 650,200 in 1953. _ Imports: Imports in 1988 will have accounted for about 20.5 percent of the steel shipped to consumers, compared with 20.9 percent in 1987. Imports reached a high of 26.4 percent in 1984, the year when the Voluntary Restraint Agreements set a goal of reducing imports to 20.2 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. The agreement expires this year. _ State Production: <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> leads the nation in steel production, with about 22 percent of the steel made there. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> accounts for 18 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> 13 percent.

 A <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> self-portrait seems to be looking down his nose at his unlikely surroundings in a little-known museum tucked away in an old house in this rural south <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> town, not too far from grazing cows. `` A lot of people come in here with -LRB- a puzzled -RRB- expression,'' said <PERSON> Delores </PERSON> <PERSON> Spears </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Zigler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>. `` They want to know how all of this got to the middle of nowhere.'' The <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> is in good company, just down the wall from a Rembrandt, a <LOCATION> Whistler </LOCATION>, a Sir <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> and dozens of other works by noted artists dating from the 17th century. Just off Interstate 10, 40 miles from the southeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> was the home of <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Zigler </PERSON>, who had a fortune and no heirs. They decided to leave a legacy to the area they loved. <PERSON> Zigler </PERSON>'s father had moved from the landlocked <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> at the turn of the century and made millions in shipbuilding, real estate, oil and gas and other interests. The <PERSON> Zigler </PERSON> legacy included a museum foundation and a separate foundation which grants full college scholarships each year to deserving students _ one from each high school in the area. That foundation also provides grants to charitable organizations, including the museum foundation, which has a smaller endowment. Since 1960 when <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Zigler </PERSON> died, the education foundation has granted $ 1 million in scholarships. Grants to other organizations total $ 3.5 million. `` That's really an economic boost when you take into account what has happened in this parish,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boisture </PERSON>, a member of the museum foundation. The parish, once fat and sassy from oil, gas and shipbuilding, fell on hard times in 1980 with the decline of the oil patch. Unemployment is over 13 percent. `` The money helps the kids, the community and all I can say is thank God for the Ziglers,'' said <PERSON> Boisture </PERSON>. Before she died in 1974, Mrs. <PERSON> Zigler </PERSON> left the old family home to the museum foundation. Two wings have been added to the two-story columned mansion to handle the growing collection, which now totals more than 150 pieces of art. Thanks to the education foundation, the museum was able to purchase the <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> in 1984 for about $ 125,000. `` We took it out of the crate and it was almost an emotional thing,'' said <PERSON> Boisture </PERSON>. `` His hair looks like you could touch it and feel the softness. He looks like he's almost glancing back with disdain at someone.'' One of the best buys, said <PERSON> Spears </PERSON>, was `` Morning'' by <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, which cost relatively little years ago `` but it's in six figures now. We've loaned it to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> museum.'' <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> says her favorites are a shoreline canvass by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Inness </PERSON> and `` The Little Mother,'' painted by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> in the 1880s. `` A lot of school kids tour through here and if just one in each group leaves with an interest in what he's seen, this museum is a success,'' said <PERSON> Boisture </PERSON>. `` Middle of nowhere or not.''

<TEXT>
 In <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>' four years as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, he has presided over an office that has indicted more than 270 public officials, government employees and others on corruption charges. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>, 45, is again in the spotlight for his role in the recent market-fraud investigation of the leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities exchanges. Observers say no one in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> is better prepared to tackle it. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement officials are investigating allegations that as many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated customers out of millions of dollars on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. No indictments have been announced and <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> has declined comment. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> has a vast knowledge of commodities trading, but it was n't built solely as a prosecutor. He learned much by defending traders. As a private attorney at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> law firm <ORGANIZATION> Jenner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Block, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> represented brokers in criminal cases and in disciplinary proceedings before the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the agency that oversees futures trading. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wedoff </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy judge who worked with <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Jenner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Block, recalled at least one instance in which <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> successfully defended a Board of Trade broker accused of breaking commodities laws. `` By the time he left <ORGANIZATION> Jenner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Block, he probably knew a much about commodities law as anyone in the city,'' <PERSON> Wedoff </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Troelstrup </PERSON> agreed Tuesday. `` When he came to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> was probably one of the most knowledgeable and experienced ... in terms of commodities experience,'' said <PERSON> Troelstrup </PERSON>, who is representing at least one of those subpoenaed in the commodities probe. When <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> native whose father was a judge, was named <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the northern district of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> in May 1985, he pledged to make prosecuting white-collar corruption a priority. `` Corruption is an epidemic-proportion problem in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. `` It would be hard for me to imagine a city in which there was more corruption.'' He joined the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office as an assistant prosecutor in 1970. He joined <ORGANIZATION> Jenner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Block in 1977 but returned to public service in 1981 when Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> appointed him to head the Metropolitan Fair and Exposition Authority. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> served as an attorney on <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s re-election campaign in 1982, and in 1985, the governor lobbied heavily to make him <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. Tactics used in the commodities probe _ `` wired'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents posing as traders in the exchanges' trading pits secretly taping alleged wrongdoing _ are familiar to <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>. His office has orchestrated elaborate sting operations with undercover agents paying off crooked police officers, judges and politicians, and taping it all on hidden recorders.

 In a rundown <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bar called the <ORGANIZATION> Sundowner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, dreams go down as easy as a cold bottle of Pearl Beer and are just as intoxicating. They are the stuff of life for many of the characters in `` The Night <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> Died,'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s pungent yet poignant tale of lost loves, missed opportunities, unfulfilled expectations and fatal mistakes. It's not a perfect play, but until it collapses into violent melodrama in Act 2, `` The Night <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> Died'' has enough low-key charm and homespun humor to soften the hardest of hearts. Maybe that's because King, author of `` The Best Little Whorehouse in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' has a jaundiced affection for the folks he has put on stage. It's love but love tempered by the knowledge that most of these people will never amount to very much. Despite its title, the play has nothing to do with the death of country-western star <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, although it is set in 1952 and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' music wails from the bar's jukebox. Its main concern is <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Stottle </PERSON>, a one-time high school football hero in the tiny town of <LOCATION> Stanley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>'s gridiron glories were nearly a decade ago Now he's `` 27 and working on a beer gut'' while he pumps gas at the local service station. Between customers, <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> aspires to be another <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> or at least a songwriter who'll sell his compositions _ which have titles like `` Little Bitty Bit of Love'' _ to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> stars like <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>. `` Nothin' wrong with dreams, providin' you act on'em,'' counsels <PERSON> Gus </PERSON>, the benevolent barkeep who extends <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>'s beer tab as he tries to rein in the boy's fantasies. <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> is galvanized by the arrival of <PERSON> Nellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, his high school sweetheart. Her marriage to an up-and-coming chiropractor has soured and she has come home `` to think about it.'' Her return rekindles <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>'s adoration as well as his ambition to make something of himself. King takes his time churning up the plot, but the wait has its diversions. His dialogue is peppered with down-home conversation, salty, sly and occasionally very funny give-and-take that is one of the evening's main pleasures. Most of these lines are the property of actor <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> who plays <PERSON> Gus </PERSON>, the bulky and blustery bartender. It's the play's most fully realized role. By the time the curtain falls, <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> has revealed the frayed and forlorn humanity behind his coarse <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> humor. <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulhern </PERSON> has a harder time playing Thurmond who, when you get down to it, is n't a very likable fellow. <PERSON> Mulhern </PERSON> also has a sweet, pleasing singing voice, something at odds with his doltish, one-track personality that smacks of loser from the very beginning. At first, <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Aidem </PERSON> comes on as too much of a dust-caked <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>, but the caricature fades when she realizes the consequences of her new fling with <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>. Strains show in the play when events turn melodramatic, particularly with the appearance of <PERSON> Nellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bess </PERSON>' fanatically devout mother who still is `` keepin' in real close touch with <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>.'' Also painted in more black than white is the local sheriff, but actor <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON> does an expert job shading in the character with a portrayal that's part good ol' boy and part smarmy <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON> of television's `` Leave It to Beaver.'' The direction by <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> meanders through the play's talkier moments and then seems frantic during its action-packed finale Still, <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> allows time for the audience to savor the people who inhabit designer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gianfrancesco </PERSON>'s wonderfully ramshackled bar _ complete with deer head above the door. `` The Night <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> Died'' is a bittersweet song to lives and loves lost, spiced with enough laughs to soften the hurt. Definitely worth a look.

 A teen-age worker in the undersea Channel Tunnel project was crushed to death by a train in the first fatal accident reported during the tunnel's construction, police said. They said the worker, who was not identified, was hit by the train carrying a load of chalk from the tunnel face one-half mile from the entrance at the port town of <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> on Monday night. The government-appointed Health and Safety Executive said it sent inspectors to investigate the accident. The proposed 34-mile tunnel, 24 miles of it under water, consists of two one-way rail tunnels and a smaller service tunnel between them. It is being bored simultaneously from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> under the English Channel at a cost of $ 8.8 billion. Digging began in December 1987. The tunnel is scheduled to open in May 1993 and would cut the London-Paris train and ferry journey from about nine hours to three.

 Here is a transcript of executed killer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s interview with religious broadcaster Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The interview, taped Monday afternoon, was released to the news media Tuesday afternoon after <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was put to death in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s electric chair. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: You are scheduled to be executed tomorrow morning at 7 o'clock if you do n't receive another stay. What is going through your mind? What thoughts have you had these last few days? Bundy: I wo n't kid you to say that it's something I feel I have control of, or something I have come to terms with, because I have n't. It's a moment-to-moment thing. Sometimes I feel very tranquil and other times I do n't feel tranquil at all. What's going through my mind right now is to use the minutes and hours I have left as fruitfully as possible and see what happens. It helps to live in the moment in the essence that we use it productively. Right now I am feeling calm and in large part because I am here with you. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: For the record, you are guilty of killing many women and girls. Is that correct? Bundy: Yes, that's correct. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: <PERSON> Ted </PERSON>, how did it happen? Take me back. What are the antecedents of the behavior that we've seen? So much grief, so much sorrow, so much pain for so many people? Where did it start, how did this moment come about? Bundy: That's the question of the hour and one that not only people much more intelligent than I will be working on for years but one that I've been working on for years and trying to understand. Is there enough time to explain it all, I do n't know. I think I understand it though, what happened to me to the extent that I can see how certain feelings and ideas have developed in me to the point that I began act to out certain very violent and very destructive feelings.

 <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: Let's go back then to those roots. First of all, as I understand it, you were raised in what you considered to have been a healthy home. You were not physically abused, you were not sexually abused, you were not emotionally abused. Bundy: No. No. And that's part of the tragedy of this whole situation. Because I grew up in a wonderful home with two dedicated and loving parents, as one of five brothers and sisters, a home where we as children were the focus of my parents' lives, where we regularly attended church, two Christian parents who did not drink, they did not smoke, there was no gambling, no physical abuse, not fighting in the home. I'm not saying this was ` Leave It To Beaver.' I do n't know that such a home exists, but it was a fine, solid Christian home and nobody, I hope no one will try to take the easy way and try to blame or otherwise accuse my family of contributing to this because I know, and I am trying to tell you as honestly as I know how what happened. This is the message I want to get across, that as a young boy, and I mean a boy of 12 or 13 certainly, that I encountered, outside the home again, in the local grocery store, in a local drug store, the soft-core pornography that people called soft core. As I think as I explained to you last night Dr. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> in an anecdote, as young boys do, we explored the back roads and sideways and byways of our neighborhood and often times people would dump the garbage and whatever they were putting out of their house. And from time to time we would come across pornographic books of a harder nature than, of a more graphic, explicit nature than we would encounter at the local grocery store. And this also inclouded such things as detective magazines. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: Those that involved violence? Bundy: Yes, yes, and this is something I think I want to emphasize is that the most-damaging kinds of pornography, and again I'm talking from personal experience, ... are those that involve violence and sexual violence. Because the wedding of those two forces is, as I know only too well, brings out the hatred that is just, just too terrible to describe. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: Now, walk me through that, what was going on in your mind at that time? Bundy: Before we go any further, I think it's important to me that people believe what I am saying. I tell you that I am not blaming pornography. I am not saying that it caused me to go out and do certain things. And I take full responsibility for whatever I have done, and all the things I have done. That's not the question here. The question and the issue is how this kind of literature contributed and helped mold and shape the kinds of violent behavior ... Dobson: It fueled your fantasies, did n't it? Bundy: In the beginning it fuels this kind of thought process, then at a certain time, it is instrumental, I would say crystalizing, making into something which is almost like a separate entity inside. At that point, I was at the verge of acting out in this kind ...

 <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: Now, I really want to understand that. You had gone about as far as you could in your own fantasy life with printed material, or printed and film ... and then there was the urge to take that little step, or big step over to a physical event? Bundy: And it happened in stages, gradually. It did n't necessarily, not to me at least, happen overnight My experience with pornography generally, but with pornography that deals on a violent level with sexuality, is once you become addicted to it, and I look at this as a kind of addiction like other kinds of addiction, I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. Like an addiction, you keep craving something that is harder, harder, something which, which gives you a greater sense of excitement. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes so far, you reach that jumping off point where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing it would give you that which is beyond just reading it or looking at it. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: How long did you stay at that point before you actually assaulted someone? Bundy: Well, yeah. That is a very delicate point, by the way in my own development. We're talking about something ... about having reached the point or gray area that, that surrounded that point over a course of years. I would say a couple of years. What I was dealing with there was very strong inhibitions against criminal behavior or violent behavior that had been conditioned into me, bred into me in my environment, in my neighborhood, in my church, in my school, things that said, ` No, this is wrong. Even to think of it is wrong, but certainly to do it is wrong.' I'm on that edge, I would say the last vestiges of restraint, the barriers to actually doing something are being tested constantly, assailed through the kind of fantasy life that was fueled largely by pornography. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: Do you remember what pushed you over that edge? Do you remember the decision to go for it, do you remember you decided to throw caution to the wind? Bundy: When you say pushed, I know what you're saying. I do n't want to infer again that I was some helpless kind of victim in that we're talking about an influence that is an influence of violent types of media, violent types of pornography which had an indispensible in the chain ... of events that led to the behavior ... the assaults, the murders It's a very difficult thing to describe, the sensation of reaching that point where I knew that, that something had say snapped, that I knew that I could n't control anymore, that the barriers I had ... learned as a child, had been instilled in me, were not enough to hold me back in respect to seeking out and harming somebody. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: Would it be accurate to call that a frenzy, a sexual frenzy? Bundy: Yes, that's one way to describe it, a compulsion ... a building up of this destructive energy. Another factor here I have n't mentioned is the use of alcohol. What alcohol did in conjuction with exposure to pornography is alcohol reduced my inhibitions at the same time the fantasy life that was fueld by pornography eroded them further. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: In the early days, you were nearly always about half drunk when you did these things, is that right? Bundy: Yes. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: Was that always true? Bundy: I would say that that was generally the case. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: All right, if I can understand it, there is this battle going on within, there are the conventions that you have been taught, there's the right and wrong that you learned as a child, and then there is this unbridled passion fueled by your plunge into hard-core, violent pornography and those things are at war with each other? And then with the alchol diminishing the inhibitions, you let go? Bundy: Yes, and it's accurate. It just occurred to me that some people will say that ` Well, I've seen that stuff and it does n't do anything to me.' And I can understand that. Virtually everyone can be exposed to pornography and while they are aroused to one degree or another, they do not go out and do anything wrong. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: Addictions are like that. They affect some people more than they affect others. But there is a percentage of people affected by hard-core pornography in a very violent way and you are obviously one of them.

 Bundy: That was a major component and I do n't know why I was vulnerable to it, all I know is that it had an impact on me that was just so central to the development of the violent behavior that I had reached. ... Dobson: <PERSON> Ted </PERSON>, after you committed your first murder, what was the emotional effect on you? What happened in the days after that? Bundy: -LRB- long pause -RRB- Please understand, that even all these years later it is very difficult to talk about and reliving through talking about it is difficult, to say the least, but I want you to understand what happened. It was like coming out of some kind of horrible trance or dream. I can only liken it to after, I do n't want to overdramatize it, but to having been possessed by something so awful and so alien, then the next morning wake up from it, remember what happened and realize that basically, I mean in the eyes of the law and certainly in the eyes of God, you were responsible; to wake up in the morning and realize what I had done and with a clear mind and all my essential moral and ethical feelings intact at that moment, absolutely horrified that I was capable of doing something ... Dobson: You really had n't known that before? Bundy: There is just absolutely no way to describe first the brutal urge to do that kind of thing and then what happens is once it has been more or less satisfied and recedes, you might say, or spent, that energy level recedes and basically I became myself again. I want people to understand this too, and I'm not saying this gratuitously because it's important that you understand this. But basically, I was a normal person, I was n't some guy hanging out at bars, or a bum. I was n't a pevert in the sense that people look at somebody and say I know there is something wrong with him, you can just tell. I was essentially a normal person. I had good friends, I led a normal life, except for this one, small but very potent and very destructive segment of it that I kept vey secret and close to myself and did n't let anyone know about. And part of the shock and horror to my dear friends and family years ago when I was first arrested was there was no clue. They looked at me and they looked at the All-American boy. I was n't perfect, ... but I was OK. I was. The basic humanity and the basic spirit that God gave me was intact, but unfortunately became overwhelmed at times. And people need to recognize it's not some kind of ... those of us who are or who have been so much influenced by violence in the media, in particular pornographic violence, are not some kind of inherent monsters. We are your sons and we are your husbands and we grew up in regular families. And pornography can reach out and snatch a kid out of any house today. It snatched me out of my home 20, 30 years ago and as dedicated as my parents were, and they were diligent in protecting their children and as good a Christian home as we had, and we had a wonderful Christian home, there is no protection against the kind of influences that are loose in society that tolerates. ...

 <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: You feel this really deeply do n't you? <PERSON> Ted </PERSON>, outside these walls, right now, there are several hundred reporters who wanted to talk to you and you asked me to come here from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> because you had something to say. This hour that we have together, is not just an interview with a man who is scheduled to die tomorrow morning. I am here and you are here because of this message that you are talking about here. You really feel that hard-core pornography and the doorway to it, soft-core pornography, is doing untold damage to other people and causing other women to be abused and killed the way you did others? Bundy: Listen. I'm no social scientist and I have n't done a survey, I mean I do n't pretend that I know what <PERSON> John </PERSON> Q. Citizen knows about this, but I have lived in prison for a long time now, and I've met a lot of men who were motivated to violence just like me. And without exception, every one of them was deeply involved in pornography, without question; without exception, deeply influenced and consumed by an addiction. There's no question about it. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s own study on serial homicide shows that the most-common interest among serial killers is pornography. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: That's true. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON>, what would your life have been like without that influence? You can only speculate. Bundy: -LRB- tears -RRB- Far better not just for me, and excuse me for being so self-centered here, but it would have been a lot better for me and lots of other people and lots of other innocent people, victims and families, it would have been a lot better. There's no question there would have been a fuller life, certainly a life that would not have involved, I am absolutely certain, a life that would not have involved this kind of violence. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: I'm sure <PERSON> Ted </PERSON>, if I were able to ask the questions that are being asked out there, one of the most important as you come down to your final hours: Are you thinking about those victims out there and their families who are so wounded and years later their lives have not returned to normal and will not return to normal? They will never return to normal. Are you carrying that load, that weight. Is there remorse there? Bundy: Again, people will accuse me of being self-serving, but I am just telling you how I feel. Through God's help, I have been able to come to the point where I much too late, but better late than never, feel the hurt and the pain that I am responsible for. Yes, absolutely. In the past few days myself and a number of investigators have been talking about a number of unsolved cases, murders that I was involved in. It's hard to talk about all these years later because it revives in me all those terrible feelings and thoughts that I have steadfastly and diligently dealt with and I think successfully, and yet its reopened that and I felt the pain and I felt the horror and I can only hope that those who I have caused so much grief, even if they do n't believe my expression of sorrow, will believe what I am saying now; that there is loose in the towns and their communities people like me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in, day out by violence in the media in various forms, particularly sexual violence. And what scares me and it's coming to the present now because what I am talking about happened 30, 20, 30 years ago in my formative state. And what scares me, Dr. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, when I see what's on cable TV, some of the movies and some of the violence in the movies that comes into homes today, the stuff that they would n't show in X-rated adult theaters 30 years ago ... Dobson: The slasher movies is what you're talking about ... Bundy: That stuff is, I'm telling you from personal experience, is the most graphic violence on screen, particularly as it gets into the home to children who are unattended or unaware that they may be a <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> who has that vulnerability, that predisposition to be influenced by that kind of behavior ... There are kids out there switching the TV dial around and come upon these movies late at night, or I do n't know when they are on, but they're on and any kid can watch them. It's scary when I think what would have happened to me if I had seen them, and it's scary enough, I just ran into stuff outside the home. But to know that children are watching that kind of thing today or can pick up their phone and dial away for it or send away for it. ...

 <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: Can you help me understand this desensitization process that took place? What was going on in your mind? Bundy: About the desensitization, I would describe it in specific terms is that each time I'd harm someone, each time I would kill someone, there would be an enormous amount, especially at first, an enormous amount of horror, guilt, remorse afterward, but then the impulse to do it again would come back even stronger. Now, believe me, I did n't ... The unique thing about how this worked, Dr. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, is I still felt in my regular life the full range of guilt and remorse about other things. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: But you had this compartmentalized. Bundy: This comparmentalized, very well focused, very sharply focused area that was a black hole that was like a crack and everything that fell into that crack hole just disappeared. Does that make sense? <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: Yeah, it does. One of the final murders that you committed, of course, was apparently little <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, 12 years of age. I think the public outcry was greater there because an innocent child was taken from a playground. What did you feel after that? Was there normal emotions three days later? Where were you, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON>? Bundy: I ca n't really talk about that. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: That's too painful. Bundy: I would like to be able to convey what that experience is like, but I ca n't be able to talk about it. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: OK. ... Bundy: I ca n't begin to understand, I can try, but I'm aware that I ca n't begin to understand the pain the parents of these children ... -LRB- inaudible -RRB- feel, and I ca n't restore really much to them, if anything and I wo n't pretend to And I do n't even expect them to forgive me and I am not asking for it. That kind of forgiveness is of God. If they have it, they have it. If they do n't maybe they'll find it someday <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: Do you deserve the punishment the state is inflicted upon you? Bundy: That's a very good question and I'll answer it very honestly. I do n't want to die, I'm not going to kid you. I kid you not. I deserve, certainly the most extreme punihsment society has and I think society deserves to be protected from me and from others like me, that's for sure. I think what I hope will come of our discussion is I think society deserves to be protected from itself. Because as we've been talking there are forces loose in this country, particularly again this kind of violent pornography where on the one hand well-meaning decent people will condemn the behavior of a <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> while they're walking past a magazine rack full of the very kinds of things that send kids down the road to be a <LOCATION> Ted </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bundy </LOCATION>. We're talking here not just about more, what I'm talking about is going beyond retribution, which is what people want with me; going beyond retribution and punishment because there is no way in the world that killing me is going to restore those beautiful children to their parents and correct and soothe the pain but I'll tell you there are lots of other kids playing in streets around the country today who are going to be dead tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the next month because other young people are reading the kinds of things and seeing the kinds of things that are available when the media took over. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: <PERSON> Ted </PERSON>, as you would imagine there is tremendous cynicism about you on the outside and I suppose for good reason. I'm not sure there is anything that you could say that people would believe, some people would believe. Bundy: Yeah. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>: And yet you told me last night, and I have heard this through our mutual friend -LRB- State Attorney -RRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, that you have accepted the forgiveness of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, and are a follower and believer in him. Do you draw strength from that in these final hours? Bundy: I do. I ca n't say that ... being in the valley of shadow of death is something that I've become all accustomed to and that I am strong and there is nothing bothering me. Listen, it is no fun. It gets kind of lonely, and yet I have to remind myself that every one of us will go through this some day in one or another and countless millions who have walked this Earth before us have. So, this is just an experience which we all share, and here I am.

 <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s new commissioner in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is <PERSON> Vasso </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> radical who once wanted <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> out of the organization. She and <PERSON> Christiane </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrivener </PERSON>, 63, of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> are the first women to serve on the 17-member <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which is made up of senior executives and now is charged with preparing for the removal of all remaining trade barriers within the 12-nation community by the end of 1992. The 44-year-old Ms. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, a close friend of but not related to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s Socialist premier, <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, was appointed by <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s president. As with all other commissioners she is expected to act independently of her country in shaping EEC policy. She has been assigned the community's taxation and customs union portfolio. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> recognizes that social affairs have been left behind,'' she said in an interview. `` There is a lot of work to be done and success depends both on Commission policy and my activity.'' A farmers's daughter from southern <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> studied economics at <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> and then earned a Ph.D. at <ORGANIZATION> Reading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. She belonged to a generation of young leftists who bitterly opposed the 1967-74 military dictatorship in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and who were inspired by <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s radical socialist policies, including pledges to take <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> out of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. But after leading his <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to power in 1981, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> decided it would be too costly to take <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> out of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>. As one of the trade bloc's poorer members, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> receives more than $ 1.5 billion a year in benefits. Premier <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and the government are now enthusiastically pro-European. Asked how she reconciles her radical and Marxist past with her new job, the tall, dark-haired Ms. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> said: `` It's not me that's changed but <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION>.'' As deputy industry minister while <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> held the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> presidency during the second half of 1988, Ms. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> chaired meetings on streamlining industrial legislation in the community. In the male-dominated world of Greek politics, Ms. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and Culture Minister <PERSON> Melina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercouri </PERSON>, the former actress who starred in `` Never on Sunday,'' have proved the only female high-fliers in the Socialist government. In her first government post as director of the Organization for Small and Medium-Size Businesses for two years from 1981, Ms. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> often was assailed by conservative businessmen, who accused her of trying to impose Marxist policies. But her two-year stint as deputy commerce minister after winning a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> seat in 1985 impressed even those critics. Ms. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s portfolio on the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will be a sensitive one. Socialist <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> member-governments, currently in the majority, will be seeking to expand labor laws and increase social security payments. But the conservative governments are likely to oppose more social welfare legislation that might further complicate the 1992 goal of moving services, goods and money freely around the community. Ms. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> says that during her years in government she has learned the art of compromise, crucial in building community policy. `` One always has to compromise,'' she said. `` But I'm taking a positive view and this will be a challenge and a great experience.'' `` She is very intelligent, a very good diplomat and knows how to maneuver,'' said <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Papoutsis </PERSON>, a Socialist member of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> who has known Ms. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> for 15 years.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Charges that West German companies helped <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> build what may be a poison gas plant recall horrors from two world wars and images of what a politician called the `` evil, self-deceiving German.'' <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> shocked the world in World War I by wiping out 5,000 Allied soldiers April 22, 1915, with chlorine gas, introducing the era of chemical warfare. The Nazis later use Zyklon B gas to kill millions of prisoners, most of them Jews, at the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp. In addition to lessons of the past, the current debate dwells on moral standards in a nation that has developed an arms export industry in the last 15 years that ranks fifth in the world. `` German profits have grown much more quickly than ethical standards,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Hengsbach </PERSON>, a social sciences professor at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgen </LOCATION> theological university in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. `` The Germans are very smart in the sense of economic realities, but they're not that shrewd when it comes to ethical responsibility and political realities,'' the 51-year-old Jesuit priest said in an interview. <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gansel </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for the opposition Social Democrats, put the problem succinctly: `` Now, our history has caught up with us again. The evil, self-deceiving German is back.'' In its current issue, the left-leaning magazine <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said the attitude of West German industry is `` export at all costs'' to guarantee prosperity at home and `` tens of thousands of people pay for the exporters' prosperity with their lives.'' `` First comes the food, and then morals?'' it said, referring to a line by the German author <PERSON> Bertolt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brecht </PERSON>. `` Not even that: many deals are made completely without morals.'' Government statistics say West German companies legally sell about $ 16.6 billion worth of guns, submarines, munitions and other arms overseas each year. That puts the country in fifth place behind the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Several state and local investigations are under way to determan the amount of arms and arms-related goods sent abroad illegally. Included are inquiries into reports of West German involvement in Iraqi poison gas production in addition to allegations that West German companies helped build the plant at <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says makes medicines and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says is for producing chemical weapons. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> acknowledged using poison gas during its war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, in which a cease-fire was reached in August, and has been accused of using it on minority Kurds. Reports arise frequently of West German companies evading export restrictions, as <PERSON> Gansel </PERSON> reminded a noisy parliamentary debate on the Libyan matter last week. `` The string of arms-export scandals is long,'' he declared, including sales of sensitive nuclear technology to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gansel </PERSON>, 48, said <PERSON> Zyklon </PERSON> B gas killed `` countless defenseless Jews'' and reminded fellow legislators the image of the `` evil, self-deceiving German'' had become a theme for both newspaper cartoons and editorials. Many newspaper stories, magazine articles and TV programs about the chemical plant scandal point out the German history of poison gas dating to World War I. <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> called poison gas part of the `` horrifying tradition of the German chemical industry'' and said, after describing the 1915 attack at Flanders: `` When the fog lifted, 5,000 Allied soldiers were dead and 10,000 seriously injured. The <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> had launched chemical warfare.'' In <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Suedeutsche </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON> reminded readers in an editorial Jan. 13: `` Not everyone may like the Germans; no one has forgotten their past. Whoever has as much power as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> must also bear responsibility.'' <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perels </PERSON>, a political science teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview: `` It is a question of current-day morality and the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past. You just ca n't lose sight of that second point. It would be better if <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> did n't supply <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> with any materials that could be used for war.'' <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Justus </PERSON> <PERSON> Perels </PERSON>, the professor's father, was executed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> along with thousands of others for alleged involvement in the unsuccessful attempt to kill <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> in 1944. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s Jewish community, said of the Libyan scandal: `` German companies should be more conscious of what's taking place in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>,'' an enemy of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` It's part of the special responsibility of the Germans, and a special responsibility is n't just something to pray about on Sundays.'' <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillgruber </PERSON>, a conservative historian on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cologne </ORGANIZATION> faculty, said attempts to link the scandal with the Nazi era are an example `` of the past that wo n't go away.'' `` You can view everything that the Germans do today against that background,'' <PERSON> Hillgruber </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hillgruber </PERSON> and other conservative historians have tried to compare the extermination of 6 million Jews with other atrocities to show the Nazi genocide does not stand alone in history.

<HEAD>Death Toll in London Crash Rises to 35</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The death toll from the collision of three trains near a busy south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> junction six weeks ago has risen to 35 with the death of a 61-year-old man. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Philipson </PERSON>, a passenger aboard a London-bound commuter train traveling from his hometown of <LOCATION> Bournemouth </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, died of his injuries at a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> hospital on Tuesday, the hospital said. Rail officials said the train <PERSON> Philipson </PERSON> was aboard slammed into the rear of another passenger train that had stopped for a malfunctioning signal about 400 yards south of <LOCATION> Clapham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> on Dec. 12. A freight train traveling in the opposite direction then plowed into spillover wreckage and apparently hit some passengers who had scrambled onto the tracks, officials said.

<TEXT>
 A Soviet-American dog sledding team announced plans Tuesday to symbolically break the ice between Siberian and Alaskan Eskimos during a 1,200-mile goodwill trek that will include the first sanctioned crossing of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> since 1948. Ten men and two women, comprising six Soviets and six Americans, plan to depart March 1 from <LOCATION> Anadyr </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, on a two-month journey visiting 30 native settlements along an old Arctic trade route. The expedition is an attempt to call attention to the common cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> region, expedition co-leader <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schurke </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said at a news conference at the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` Some of the team members have relatives on the other side,'' <PERSON> Schurke </PERSON> said, so it could be a very emotional experience. Because visitors are rare in villages so close to the top of the world, he predicted that the expedition would be met with `` spontaneous celebrations and jamborees'' and that schools would be let out so that the children could ski along with the team for a while. A veteran of Arctic travel who made an unassisted trek to the North Pole in 1986, <PERSON> Schurke </PERSON> said the journey was `` an opportunity to combine my interest in travel in the north with playing a part in the process of improving Soviet-American relations.'' Speaking through an interpreter, Soviet co-leader <PERSON> Dmitry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shparo </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, praised <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the major American corporate sponsor of the Bering Bridge Expedition. <PERSON> Shparo </PERSON> also put in a plug for the main Soviet sponsors, Pravda's youth newspaper, the tourist bureau known as Sputnik and <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION>, a news agency. Although he is a mathematics professor at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alloys </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shparo </PERSON> is best known as a writer and adventurer. In 1979, he won the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s highest honor, the Order of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, for successfully leading a ski expedition to the North Pole. Last year, he was a member of a Soviet-Canadian trek across the polar ice cap from the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, who also attended the news conference, called the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> Expedition `` another step toward melting the ice curtain.'' <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> noted that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is working on a new treaty with the Soviets that would permit American Eskimos to visit and trade with their counterparts in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> without visas. In 1938, the two countries signed an agreement that regularized travel in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> region, but that agreement was abrogated in 1948 during the iciest days of the Cold War. In the spirit of adventure diplomacy, the team hopes a new agreement can be signed at a ceremony at the U.S.-Soviet border around April 1.

 The hooded executioner who electrocuted <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was a civilian who received $ 150, a chauffeured escort to and from the prison and a guarantee of anonymity. The executioner was chosen from a list the state has been using since it advertised for executioners in 1976, when the death penalty was reinstated. `` If we did n't take precautions, there are enough crackpots inside and outside this prison that'd be threatening them,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, superintendent of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> State Prison. `` They threaten me every day.'' Only <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> knows who's on the list. He is also the only person who handles the arrangements. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, a spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, said he did n't know the identity of <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s executioner but added it could have been a woman, which was speculated by some witnesses to <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s execution. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, who confessed to killing more than 20 women, was put to death in the electric chair Tuesday for raping and murdering a 12-year-old girl. While security is paramount for the executioner's job, skill is incidental. `` All the executioner does is start the cycle by turning a switch or pressing a button _ I wo n't say which _ and the thing is programmed from there,'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said. The executioner stands in a booth behind and to the right of the electric chair, watching through a 9-inch-by-4-foot opening in the wall as the condemned prisoner is buckled into the chair. A light on a panel of dials before the executioner indicates that the current is sufficient. When <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> gives the signal, the executioner activates the machine, which pumps up to 3,000 volts and 20 amps of electricity through the chair and into the body.

<TEXT>
 About 47 pounds of cocaine was discovered Tuesday on an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet that had stopped at Miami International Airport en route from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, officials said. No arrests were made by late Tuesday and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> officials are considering whether fines will be levied against the financially troubled carrier, fined $ 1 million last fall after cocaine was discovered on two flights within a two-week span, said Customs spokesman <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>. Before the cocaine was found, the plane had been cleared by Customs inspectors following a routine search, said <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>. Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said a flight attendant found a plastic packet containing cocaine inside one of the exit doors, leading to an extensive search of the L-1011 aircraft that arrived from <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, at about 4 p.m. EST. The cocaine was between the panels of the door and above the lavatories of Flight 50, she said. But <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said several packets of cocaine were discovered by a member of the cleaning crew in the rest rooms. He said vibrations apparently dislodged the cocaine, which was concealed behind ceiling panels above the rest rooms. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said the manner the cocaine was hidden suggests it was placed by someone with extensive access to and knowledge of the plane. The search was completed about 9:30 p.m. EST, he said. All passengers were accommodated on other flights, Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said. Since Sept. 13, Customs agents have seized five loads of cocaine on Eastern flights from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, including 68 pounds of cocaine hidden in a box of ground coffee in November and 56 pounds of cocaine found in a mail bag in October. Eastern says it spends more than $ 3 million a year fighting drug trafficking. Avianca, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s national airline, banned cargo from its flights last June after paying $ 8 million in federal fines linked to drug seizures.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: A President Who Stops for Stop Lights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stops at red lights. Sometimes. In a city used to seeing dignitary-bearing motorcades screeching through traffic lights, sirens wailing, at all times of day and night, the sight is more than a little unusual. There was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 15-car motorcade, waiting for a traffic light to change, right along with other backed-up traffic on a busy downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> street. No sirens. No flashing police-car lights. The president was on his way to a local <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base, <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>, for a Tuesday afternoon jog and did n't want to disrupt traffic any more than was necessary. It's not as though anyone would write him a traffic ticket. He was simply following a pattern he'd established in his eight years as vice president, said aide <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanca </PERSON>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s preference as vice president was to stop at lights, keep things as normal as possible,'' <PERSON> Zanca </PERSON> said Of course, as vice president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't require 15 cars to go jogging. He just stepped outside his door and ran. The vice president's residence is on the sprawling grounds of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Naval Observatory, and there's lots of space for jogging and other outdoor activities. There is n't as much room at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, forcing the new president to seek out new jogging trails. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once suggested that he might return to the vice presidential grounds from time to time to do his jogging, joking that he had already sought _ and obtained _ permission from the man who would be living there next, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 64, jogs at a relatively sedate pace, about a mile every 10 minutes. He usually runs for 20 minutes, two or three times a week. The chief executive's decision to observe traffic signals apparently only applies to personal trips, not when he's going somewhere on official business. Then, it's the regular presidential motorcade _ which gets an elaborate police escort and travels on streets where traffic has already been cleared. Such motorcades completely ignore traffic signals along the way.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is trim at 6-foot-2 and 190 pounds, may jog to help counter the waistline-expanding effect of another presidential passion: deep-fried pork rinds. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held his first Cabinet meeting on Monday, gone was the crystal jar of jellybeans that predecessor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used to have sitting before him. By Tuesday, there was a large jar again _ only this one was filled with pork rinds. It was a gift of House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, one of a group of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had invited to meet with him in the Cabinet Room to discuss the budget. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also presented fellow Texan <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a large bottle of `` Texas Pete'' hot pepper sauce. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is known to love to smother all manner of food with hot sauce. During his campaign, a standard meal for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aboard Air Force Two was tuna fish sandwiches drenched with hot sauce. `` We want to give a very warm welcome to the president,'' said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picked up the bottle of hot sauce and closely examined the label. `` How come <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> hot sauce is made in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> retorted: `` Same way that some Texans were born in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>.'' The room erupted in laughter, even though <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s citation of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> origins was off by a few states. While his family maintains a vacation home in the seaside resort town of <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Milton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and grew up in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. `` I'm just overwhelmed by both the pork rinds and the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> hot sauce,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` You talk about cooperation, ecumenical spirit, outreach. Just lovely.''

<TEXT>
 Big government in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> may get the most publicity, but a new <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> report shows that government is big business in the rest of the country as well, with more than a half-million Americans holding elective office. From school board president to the nation's president, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to county commissioner, public officials total 504,404, the bureau reported Tuesday in a study based on its 1987 census of governments. That's up from 490,807 elected officials counted a decade earlier, the bureau said. `` It's quite a statement about the extent of democracy, particularly the grassroots democracy, in the country,'' said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Cull </PERSON>, a census statistician who compiled the figures. It means the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now has more officeholders than bank tellers. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> estimated there were 467,000 tellers in 1987. But while the report found that holding public office is widespread, it also shows officeholders do n't necessarily represent a cross-section of the nation. Only 20 percent were women, while 2 percent were blacks and 1 percent were Hispanic. Nationally, women make up just over half the population while the nation is about 12 percent black and 7 percent Hispanic. Most of the growth in elected officeholders since 1977 results from the growth of special districts around the nation, Ms. <PERSON> Cull </PERSON> said. These include independent water and sewer districts, housing authorities, transit administrations and similar independent bodies with elected boards. Special districts accounted for 80,509 elected officials on 29,532 governmental bodies in the 1987 study. That's up from 72,377 officeholders running 25,962 special districts in 1977. That increase of more than 8,000 officials was well ahead of any other group, although special districts were only fourth in the total number of officeholders. Municipalities, towns and school districts continue to have larger totals of officials elected to public office. The leading group is municipalities, with 137,688 officials serving 19,200 communities in 1987. That's up from 134,017 officeholders in 18,862 municipalities in 1977. Townships came in second in both years, totaling 120,790 officials in 1987 and 118,966 a decade earlier year. During that period the total number of township governments declined from 16,822 to 16,691. School districts were the nation's third largest job source for elected officials, providing offices for 86,772 people in 1987. That was down from 1977, however, when 87,062 people held elected school board positions. That drop occurred in parallel with a decline in the number of school districts in the nation, slipping from 15,174 to 14,721. The nation's 3,042 counties _ the same in both studies _ provided somewhat fewer elected offices in 1987 than in 1977. The total fell from 62,922 to 59,932. The states, meanwhile, increased their number of elected offices. They harbored 18,171 elected officials in 1987, up from 15,294 in 1977. The 1977 report did not include figures for federal officeholders. The new study put that number at 542, a total which Ms. <PERSON> Cull </PERSON> said was unchanged. Elected federal officials include 435 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, 100 senators, five congressional delegates from territories and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and, of course, the president and vice president. The 1987 report looked at the characteristics of local government officials for the first time, <ORGANIZATION> Cull </ORGANIZATION> said. It found that women were most likely to be on school boards, making up 26.5 percent of elected school officials. Women constituted 23.1 percent of township officials and 20.8 percent of county officers. They were 18.5 percent of the municipal officials and only 11.5 percent of those serving on special districts. Blacks, on the other hand, were most often represented on municipal governments, holding 3.3 percent of those posts. Blacks made up 2.6 percent of the county officials and 2.4 percent of school district officeholders. They were 0.6 percent of the special district officials and 0.4 percent in town offices. School districts were the most common spot for Hispanics, at 1.8 percent. They held 1.3 percent of municipal offices and 1.2 percent in special districts. Hispanics comprised 1 percent of county officials and 0.2 percent of town officers.

<HEAD>Income Growth Slowest in Energy States</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Personal incomes are increasing the least in the nation's energy states, while the coasts are recording the biggest gains, the government reports. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> region had the highest increase in personal incomes of any region, an 8.9 percent gain in the 12 months ending with September 1988. Following close behind were the far West states of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with a gain of 8.7 percent. At the other extreme were the Rocky Mountain states, a region heavily dependent on oil and gas exploration, where incomes rose 6.1 percent on average from the third quarter of 1987 to the third quarter of last year. `` We are still seeing the effects of weak energy prices,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> DePass </PERSON>. `` While some states have been able to diversify their economies, others have not.'' Nationally, non-farm incomes rose 7.8 percent in the period ending in September, virtually identical to the 7.7 percent rise in overall incomes posted for the 12-month period ending with the second quarter. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> has led the country in income growth for much of the recovery following the 1981-82 recession as its high-technology industries have benefited from the big defense buildup of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. However, the rate of income growth has slowed in this area in the past year, reflecting a slowdown in defense spending, <PERSON> DePass </PERSON> said. The most recent quarterly reports have shown that income growth in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Rust Belt has begun to stage a comeback, reflecting a rebound in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing as a weaker dollar has made <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods competitive once again on overseas markets. The rebound in manufacturing has helped narrow but not eliminate the bi-coastal lead in incomes, the department said. Critics of economic policies during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years say the record peacetime recovery has essentially been a bi-coastal expansion, with both coasts doing well while <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s heartland suffered. Over the 12 months ending with September 1988, incomes in coastal states have grown by 8.3 percent, 6 percent above the national average, while income in interior regions of the country grew 7 percent, 10 percent below the national average. Earlier in the expansion the difference was much wider with coastal growth 10 percent higher than the national average while interior regions were growing 17 percent below the national average. By state, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> had the biggest percentage increase for the 12 months ending in September, a 12.9 percent gain fueled by big increases in construction payrolls. Hotel and motel construction there reflected a boom in tourism. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> was followed by a 9.9 percent gain in non-farm incomes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and a 9.6 percent rise in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Also posting large increases were <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, both at 9.3 percent. With inflation rising at an annual rate of 4.4 percent last year, the figures showed that these states stayed well ahead of the increase in prices. At the other end of the scale, income growth in some states just barely kept up with the rise in prices. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> ranked last with a 4.2 percent rise in non-farm incomes over the period ending with the third quarter, followed by <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> with a 4.8 percent increase. Other states with low income growth were <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, 5.2 percent; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, 5.3 percent; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 5.3 percent, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, 5.8 percent _ all states where depressed energy prices have hurt incomes. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> focuses on changes in non-farm income as a better indication of a region's prosperity because of the often erratic nature of agriculture.

<HEAD>This Cement Promises Doom for Potholes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hard-nosed highway engineers from across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> watched as workmen in gray laboratory smocks smoothed out a fresh-laid bed of concrete on the floor of a hotel ballroom. They may have been witnesses to the dawning of a new age of cement. The product called Pyrament -LRB- cement that lasts as long as the Pyramids -RRB- will divide cement history into eras: `` B.P. and A.P. _ Before Pyrament and After Pyrament,'' proclaimed <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Lone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, `` It's a material as close to stone as anything can be without being stone,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. Concrete is a mixture of cement powder, sand, water and gravel. Concrete made of Pyrament hardens in four hours. Some poured at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday in the ballroom of the Omni-Shoreham Hotel was hard as a rock at lunchtime. That means fix a highway in the night and traffic can roll on it during the next morning's rush hour. By contrast, conventional concrete takes a week or two to cure. Pyrament costs six to eight cents a pound, twice as much as ordinary cement. `` But the cost of the cement is an insignificant part of the cost of construction,'' said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. Lone Star, which makes a tenth of the 90 million tons of cement consumed each year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has been losing business to cheap imported cement. The company's cement and concrete profits fell in half in 1987. It thinks Pyrament, whose formula is secret, may be the answer to its prayers. The company invited a thousand transportation research executives, attending a convention, to come kick its tires. They tried to be skeptical. `` I've put down an awful lot of test pavement in my 33 years as a professor of civil engineering,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who once worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Pottawattamie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` This shows excellent potential in terms of flexural and compressive strengths.'' Said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, a transportation engineer specializing in highway maintenance for the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>: `` I'd like to get some and mix it and put it down in the real world. And see if it does as good as they say.'' Not only can highways be repaired overnight, <ORGANIZATION> Lone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said, but: _ <ORGANIZATION> Pyrament </ORGANIZATION>'s extra strength will permit thinner concrete beams, allowing skyscrapers to have more floors in the same height as those built with run-of-the-mill concrete _ Pyrament will cure in temperatures as low as 28 degrees Fahrenheit Conventional concrete wo n't harden when the temperature falls below 35. So the construction season can be extended deeper into the winter. _ Pyrament can be used to repair emergency facilities in earthquakes or airport runways in combat _ Potholes may become things of the past Rather than patch them with asphalt, repair crews will be able to remove a potholed panel of roadway and replace it overnight. The company is road-testing this slogan: `` Repair at night and drive at dawn.''

<HEAD>New Group Campaigns For No-Fault Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>B1y GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 True no-fault auto insurance could mean savings of hundreds of dollars for families in some states although the overall impact on premiums nationwide would be little more than 6 percent, according to a study commissioned by a group backing universal no-fault. The new study did not identify which states would see such large savings, and its sponsors said they were still `` massaging the data'' to come up with those estimates. The analysis by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heiden </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consultant, for the new group <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION>, said consumers in 47 states could be expected to save $ 3.7 billion in premiums overall under a true no-fault system. There are 135 million cars on the road, and the study said the average auto insurance premium was $ 434 per car in 1987. This would imply a national insurance bill of $ 59 billion if there were no uninsured cars and no trucks used as cars were counted. If that $ 59 billion is true, the $ 3.7 billion saving would be a little more than 6 percent. `` It is reasonable to conclude that some households could see declines in their annual insurance bills of as much as several hundred dollars'' if plans similar to those of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were used nationwide, the group said. New Start considers those states to have the only true no-fault systems. Twelve states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> use elements of no-fault in their insurance law, and 11 states have what the group calls `` phony no-fault.'' Under no-fault, victims file claims against their own companies, just as they would for medical insurance. The companies are supposed to pay no matter who is at fault. With traditional insurance, a victim must sue somebody to determine who caused the accident and whose insurance must pay. The New Start group was organized by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, director of the Center for Consumer Affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> and the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McEwen </PERSON>, professor of economics at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said no insurance industry funds had been used in forming the new organization, which he said has gained 20,000 members since it was born last October. <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Knauer </PERSON>, consumer affairs adviser to Presidents <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, will be national chair of the group and will undertake a coast-to-coast tour next month to drum up support for converting all states to no-fault. Rising premiums in states with traditional insurance have prompted political outcries in several states recently. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters last fall passed a referendum requiring companies to reduce premiums 20 percent. Nationwide, auto insurance premiums increased 60 percent from 1982 to 1987 while the Consumer Price Index was increasing 17 percent. Critics say this overpays those who are n't hurt much and pays too little to the badly injured.

<HEAD>Signs of Drought Remain in Winter Wheat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government report says there has been little relief for parched winter wheat fields in huge areas of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, the middle of the nation's breadbasket. Winter wheat was planted last fall and will be harvested this summer. Normally, it provides about three-fourths of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat supply. Farmers will sow the remainder this spring. The Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday that insects along with dry weather also continued to damage wheat during the week of Jan. 16-22. The facility is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce departments. Winter wheat is watched closely this time of year for signs of damage and potential yield losses. It will lead off the 1989 harvest season. Historically, January is the driest month in the plains states, and winter wheat, usually dormant at midwinter, has been known to improve dramatically as the result of good moisture in February and March. But drought reduced 1988 production, and there has been a heavy drain on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and world stockpiles. And the possibility of further losses in 1989 can not be ignored. `` In <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, winter wheat continued to show moisture stress,'' the report said. `` Greenbug damage was a continuing problem in the southwest and southcentral areas -LRB- of the state -RRB-.'' The dry conditions were causing winter wheat in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> to turn yellow, and mild temperatures have allowed greenbugs to multiply. Rain helped conditions in parts of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but dry soils continued to hurt winter grains in many areas, the report said. Greenbug damage was apparent in many fields, too. `` Snow cover was needed in most of the northern plains,'' the report said. `` Snow cover was adequate in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and portions of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s winter wheat was mostly fair to good, with only light wind damage.'' The <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> winter wheat crop was reported in mostly good condition, and it was said to be in `` mostly good to fair'' shape in the Corn Belt but lacked protective snow cover. `` Small grains in the -LRB- <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and Southeast were mostly good, the report said. `` Seeding continued in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Wet soil slowed seeding in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' The above-normal temperatures reduced livestock stress during the week in most areas, although there were some respiratory problems in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the report said. Rain helped improve pastures in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and in central and southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Looking at some other crops, the report said: _ Rain slowed land preparation and fertilizer application in the Delta Tobacco plant bed preparation and seeding continued in the Southeast. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, cotton seedbeds were pre-irrigated and fertilizer. _ Needed rain benefited <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s citrus areas, and most producers were able to discontinue irrigation _ <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s vegetable areas also benefited from rain, and spring crop planting has been moving along Winter harvest of vegetables also continued during the week, with tomatoes, peppers, cabbage, celery, lettuce and squash among the volume leaders. _ Rain slowed the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> vegetable harvest, and cold weather hampered work in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 635,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices, virtually wiping out its current purchase authority under an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> program. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldthwait </PERSON>, acting general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday the wheat was part of 2 million tons authorized Dec. 23 under the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. The wheat was bought under a long-term supply agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, now in its sixth year. <PERSON> Goldthwait </PERSON> said the wheat is for shipment in February and March. Counting some wheat left over from previous EEP arrangements, the Soviets have only 35,200 tons still available under the program. With the latest sales, the Soviets have bought about 1.65 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat for delivery in the sixth year of the pact. The agreement expired last Sept. 30 but was later extended through Dec. 31, 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 635,000 tons of wheat would be about 23.3 million bushels. Wheat prices at the farm have been averaging more than $ 4 per bushel, according to recent <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> market figures, making the new sale worth an estimated $ 93 million. Besides the wheat for 1988-89 delivery under the pact, the Soviets have ordered 10.2 million tons of corn, 450,000 tons of soybeans, and 1,132,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum. Only the wheat is subsidized.

<HEAD>Mosbacher Urged to be More Aggressive Advocate for US Businesses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Commerce Secretary-designate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> got a warm welcome at his Capitol Hill debut and received a stern admonition to make the government a more aggressive advocate for American businesses in the world marketplace. At <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s confirmation hearing Tuesday before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, several legislators complained that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which suffered a record trade deficit of $ 170.1 billion in 1987, does n't do enough to protect and promote its industries in global trade. Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, said the nation suffers from `` a bureaucratic reluctance to be aggressive in support of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry.'' `` We're losing everything, all the technology,'' committee Chairman <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>. `` What we really need is your enthusiasm, your toughness and aggressiveness. ... Do n't just flutter around <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and say: ` Free trade, free trade. We do n't want to start a trade war.''' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman and longtime friend of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, pledged vigorous enforcement of laws designed to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses from unfair foreign competition and said that building exports will be his top priority in reducing the trade deficit. `` While we certainly do and have opened our nation to the goods of the world, we expect that to be reciprocated,'' he said. `` If it is not, I do n't see that we have any course but to strongly, fairly, objectively, totally enforce'' the laws governing international trade. Asked his strategy for addressing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, he said, `` We must build our exports first.'' He called for greater efforts to educate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses about export opportunities and for reduced red tape in granting export licenses for items whose sales would not harm national security or strategic interests. `` Everything that is not in those two categories should be given -LRB- a -RRB- license ... as soon as possible,'' he said. American exports have strengthened as the weaker dollar has made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers' products more competitive overseas. But analysts believe the dollar would have to decline further to spur more export gains. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, one of four Texans named to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabinet </PERSON>, comes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> without government experience and after making his fortune in the oil business. His nomination is expected to win easy approval from the committee next week. Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a fellow Texan, told the committee that <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> was a tough international businessman who would `` do the job that has to be done'' in making <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> more competitive.

 Singer <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Torme </PERSON> says he expects to be left out of the winner's circle this year at the Grammys, thanks to his criticism of the award panel that voted him honors two years in a row. <PERSON> Torme </PERSON>, who will be appearing at the Sands Hotel, Casino and Country Club this weekend, blasted the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recording </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sciences for failing to nominate his partner on both award-winning albums, pianist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearing </PERSON>. By 1982, <PERSON> Torme </PERSON> had received 11 Grammy nominations for Best Jazz Vocalist. Because five of the nominated albums were collaborations with Shearing, <PERSON> Torme </PERSON> asked the nominating committee why Shearing had been ignored. `` They told me they had no category for him,'' <PERSON> Torme </PERSON> said. `` So we make the album ` An Evening With <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearing </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Torme </PERSON>,''' <PERSON> Torme </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> asked me ` why do you want to do this?'

That album gave <PERSON> Torme </PERSON> his first Grammy in 1983, and in 1984 the duo's follow-up `` Top Drawer'' earned him his second. This year, he is nominated for `` A Vintage Year,'' while Shearing is again ignored. The Grammys will be awarded Feb. 22 on CBS-TV. `` I wo n't win this Grammy.

 The Democratic chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a conservative <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> member are drafting companion bills aimed at punishing countries that use chemical weapons and the private Western companies that help produce them. The bills were announced at a hearing Tuesday in which senators cited reports that the West German government did nothing to prevent German industries from helping <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> nations obtain chemical warfare capability. Also at the hearing, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is now satisfied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is responsibly addressing the situation and will act soon to tighten export controls. The arms control chief, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, also told senators that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is stockpiling biological weapons in violation of a 1972 agreement banning them worldwide. Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he is readying a bill to require <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic and economic sanctions against any nation using chemical or biological weapons. He said the legislation will ask other nations to do likewise. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, said he will sponsor companion legislation to impose sanctions against companies of any nationality supplying chemical warfare equipment and technology to Third World nations. `` I have every reason to believe that, in the end, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration will see the wisdom of both approaches,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> told the hearing that about 20 nations have the capacity to produce chemical weapons. He said about five or six are known to have used or stockpiled them. Responding to questions, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> listed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as poison gas stockpilers. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> are reported to have used chemical weapons. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is maintaining stocks of biological weapons in violation of the 1972 international agreement outlawing the manufacture and possession of germ warfare agents. `` We believe the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> does have a stock of biological weapons and obviously they must have some capacity to produce them,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> asked how, in that case, the Soviets can be trusted to comply with a new international agreement, soon to be negotiated, banning the manufacture, stockpiling and use of poison gas and other chemical weapons. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> replied that the 1972 agreement had no provisions for monitoring and verifying compliance while any new pact will have verification provisions. He acknowledged, however, that verification will be difficult and that perfect monitoring probably can not be achieved. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> complained that West German companies were helping Third World countries, especially in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, obtain chemical weapons capability. He also said a West German company is helping <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> obtain the ability to refuel warplanes in flight, extending their range and giving them the ability to strike <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The problem is extremely grim,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. `` With the critical assistance of Western industrial firms, the four most radical regimes in the world are acquiring weapons of mass destruction.'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, who said he had discussed the situation with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said the attitude of the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government has changed significantly. `` I think the West German government is on the right track and I applaud the activities they are undertaking now,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has emerged as the front-runner in the race for <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman, despite complaints from party conservatives about his association with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the 1988 presidential campaign. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> picked up endorsements from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Democrats on Tuesday, the latest in a series of announcements that cemented his position as the man to beat in the race to succeed <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as chairman of the party. At the same time, an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> party leader said election of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> as chairman would be a victory for the `` <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ultra-liberal element.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was trying `` play on the liberal conscience'' by making an issue of the fact that he is black and had ties to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` He stands up and he says ` I'm the most qualified candidate' _ which is a ridiculously presumptuous statement _ and if I was n't black I'd win and if I was n't connected to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> I'd win,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> `` That's tremendously presumptive and that's a slap at the other candidates. It's <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> who's creating that, trying to play on the liberal conscience.'' Among those who have endorsed <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s convention manager last year, are Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. Party sources said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would add his backing to <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> by week's end and that <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> would join their governor in that endorsement. Also competing for the party leadership are <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> and former Reps. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> met over the weekend and sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they discussed the possibility of combining forces. However, the sources said they were unable to reach agreement on which should drop out and support the other. <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members will vote Feb. 10 to fill the chairmanship for a four-year term, but many committee members say they hope the race will be settled before the vote. `` A lot of us want it to be over before we get to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Suellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. When <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> first began seeking support for the chairmanship, his role in the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign was cited by Jews prominent in party affairs as a reason for opposing him. However, a group of Jewish activists including Rep. <PERSON> Sander </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, a leading fund-raiser for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>; <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorenstein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> endorsed <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and worked to convince Jewish Democrats that it was unfair to link <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` A number of us have talked to opinion-makers within the Jewish community,'' said <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>. In an article written for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Jewish Weekly, <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> wrote that `` <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> did not subscribe to every position held by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. He has made clear that he would respond to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as to other Democratic leaders, with no hesitation to accept his views when he is right nor to reject them when he is wrong.'' <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> raised money for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and also boosted his candidacy among other Jews. `` I do n't see <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> as being somehow a radical guy who just because he was convention manager for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> somehow bought into all of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s rhetoric,'' he said. `` I recognize that for some the perception can be all wrong,'' said <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>. `` They'll say <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> can be the greatest guy in the world, he can be a fine, wonderful guy with lots of judgment, lots of vision, but it's just going to play badly in a lot of places.'' A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney who once was staff director of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was chairman, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> agreed last spring to serve as convention manager for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. In that role, he was widely credited with helping bring about the show of unity on the closing night of the convention. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that if <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is elected chairman he would think it was `` wasting the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s money'' to continue attending national party functions. `` You ca n't secede from the national party, though, frankly, I would,'' he said. `` I'm not sure that's what we need right now,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruvolo </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman, who backs <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> for the national post. `` Mr. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s remarks not only surprise me, but they make me very sad,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddington </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member from <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Small Businesses Say Tax Change Costs Them Money, Workers Benefits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should repeal a provision of the 1986 tax overhaul that small business owners say has prompted them to consider slashing employee benefits. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, filed the legislation Tuesday, the first of two days of hearings on Section 89 of the tax overhaul. The section was designed to encourage expanded benefit programs but, according to small business interests, has resulted in just the opposite. `` This was a shortcut someone tried to make along the way that ended up being a roadblock for small business instead of an aid,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Galles </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, told the committee. Any changes to the law, however, would have to be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has been reluctant to tinker with it because even minor changes bring calls for more significant amendments. Section 89, which took effect Jan. 1, requires all business owners to determine if their health and life insurance programs discriminate in favor of higher-paid employees. Discriminatory benefits would be subject to higher taxation. Employees are defined as those who work 17 1 @ 2 hours a week or more. But witnesses at the hearing said using that definition will inevitably lead to findings that most benefit plans are discriminatory because employers routinely offer superior benefits to full-time employees and those in highly skilled jobs. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Satagaj </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the `` dramatic and unprecedented change in the definition of employee'' would force cost-conscious small businesses to either eliminate part-time positions to avoid being labeled discriminatory or do away with employer-paid health benefits altogether. The law also requires employers to inform employees of any planned changes in benefit programs to bring the company in compliance with the law. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, said most small businessmen are not aware of the law and are in effect already violating it, either by not beginning the required tests or by failing to properly notify workers of planned benefit changes. Instead of paying thousands of dollars or more to have their benefit programs tested for compliance, many small business owners have indicated they would eliminate employer-paid insurance and instead give their workers a pay raise, <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> said. That would hurt workers because their taxable income would increase and they would have to pay higher health insurance rates than would a business purchasing a group plan, <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> said.

<HEAD>Alfonsin Declares War On Subversion After `Nightmare' Siege</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> declared all-out war on leftist subversion after touring a suburban army base where at least 36 people were killed in a battle between troops and besieged civilian commandos. Troops were still scouring the smoldering rubble of the ravaged <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tablada </ORGANIZATION> base Tuesday night as <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> told the nation the attack was `` a new challenge that I believe is the most serious and decisive of my administration.'' The 3rd Infantry Regiment base was seized Monday by heavily armed civilians and retaken a day later by army and police forces who had pummeled commando positions with howitzers, mortars, grenades and machine-gun fire. In his nationally broadcast speech, the president recalled his impressions of the base and the charred and mangled corpses he encountered there: `` It was a nightmare. Death, once again death. The brutality, the barbarity.'' He said seven soldiers, one policeman and 28 commandos were killed and that all but four of the 67 wounded were soldiers and policemen. Authorities said troops captured 14 of the commandos, who apparently intended to steal weapons from the base and quickly flee. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> described the attackers as `` irregular elements of ultra-leftist affiliation,'' citing a written proclamation found at the base as `` evidence of their hallucination.'' A copy of the proclamation given to reporters said the base was seized to pre-empt a purportedly imminent coup by right-wing army officers. `` We are fed up with the arrogance of the military,'' it said. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> was elected in 1983 to end a nearly eight-year military dictatorship during which 8,900 suspected leftist subversives were arrested and vanished without a trace, presumably murdered by security forces. Given such incidents as the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tablada </ORGANIZATION> raid, a Dec. 4 military uprising led by now-cashiered Col. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON>, and the subsequent bombing of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters, Argentine's fear that political extremism is returning to the country. The English-language newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Buenos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aires </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> commented in an editorial Tuesday: `` If the -LRB- La Tablada -RRB- attack did come from the extreme left, this means that democracy is now under a two-pronged assault from right and left for the first time in more than a decade ... `` Now the army has the terrorist threat that has been missing so long and the government must worry about the civilian left, not just the military right.'' Presidential elections are set for May 14. By law, <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> can not run for re-election, and favored to win is the opposition party candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>. Inflation is averaging more than 300 percent a year, real wages are declining and economic and social unrest is high. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> on Tuesday set up a national security council. He did not say who would sit on the body, but it was generally believed that top military officials would be among its members. The president praised the soldiers' bravery in retaking the base, and said: `` I want to tell them that this is also my fight ... and I will fight it to the end.'' Looking on as he spoke were his military chiefs of staff. The right-wing armed forces in this country that has seen six military coups since 1930 have been a constant headache for <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. In the past 21 months, he has had to cope with three uprisings by elements in the army angered by the prosecution of officers for human rights abuses. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> has insisted that subversion be combatted within legal bounds, unlike the military's `` dirty war'' of the 1970s when the thousands of suspected leftists disappeared. `` This is our chance to show the world and ourselves that we have learned from the past,'' he declared Tuesday night. The president said leftist extremism would be fought `` only within the law, but with all the force of the law.'' `` If anyone believes that democracy is a weak system, they now are going to learn how wrong they are,'' he said. `` This is the last great test of my government and we are not going to lose.''

 Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, as well as the lobbying groups that pay them, are self-conscious about the practice of picking up large fees for speeches or panel discussions before one interest group or another. Next week, for instance, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesaler-Distributors </ORGANIZATION> is hosting a two-day conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> where eight senators and four <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members are scheduled to speak. The association issued a notice, giving directions to the hotel ballroom, times and topics, making sure reporters knew they were welcome. It gave phone numbers in case anyone has any questions. Ask how much the senators and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members are being paid for their speeches, and the conversation dies. `` I'm not prepared to get into an interview of that type,'' said <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dongen </PERSON>, president of the association. That kind of reaction is understandable, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlowe </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lobbyists </ORGANIZATION>, who would like to see <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> abolish the practice of paying politicians to talk. The fees, known as honoraria, are an added source of personal income for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who can keep from $ 26,850 to $ 35,800 annually, depending on whether they are House or <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members. `` It's perfectly legal, but the perception is that it's bad, so therefore you have people who do n't want to talk about it,'' <PERSON> Marlowe </PERSON> said. `` We all in this town are competing for some forms of access and power,'' he said. `` It is easier to buy it than to talk your way into it _ that's buying access and not buying influence.'' A proposal on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to ban the practice is informally linked to boosting congressional salaries 50 percent from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who late in the spring are required to disclose how much they make in speaking fees along with other financial information, are not eager to give that out before they have to. `` We are required by law to disclose that information on an annual basis, but I do n't think that it's a good idea to give it out on a piecemeal basis,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON>, spokesman for Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., who made $ 78,500 in speaking fees in 1987, the last year for which records are available Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., was reluctant to disclose how much he's received in honoraria since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recessed before the election last fall But when pressed, his office acknowledged he got $ 21,000 for making five speeches in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, earlier this month while he was at a golf tournament. Lawmakers in both houses can retain up to $ 2,000 per article or event, with any fee exceeding that figure _ or any amount over the annual cap _ going to charity. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> which writes the nation's tax laws, made $ 245,000 in speaking fees last year and gave enough of it to charity to drop just below the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limit, which at the time was less than $ 26,000. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> was n't alone in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> in mid-January. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> hosted 27 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at a posh resort near there, but institute spokesman <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Merryman </PERSON> would n't say how much they were paid or how much of their expenses were picked up He did say that everyone was treated equally. Among those attending the conference was Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.D. </LOCATION>, whose office said he earned a $ 2,000 honorarium, along with round-trip air fare for him and his wife and three nights' lodging. The tab: $ 1,392. <PERSON> Marlowe </PERSON> said the league of lobbyists has not taken a position on the issue of abolishing honoraria, but he favors getting rid of the practice because of the bad appearance, which he compared to a skin blemish. If it is banned, he said, some of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s finest minds will start looking for loopholes. `` I honestly am stuck on what will rise up to take its place, but I have every confidence in the ingenuity of the players involved that something will rise up,'' he said. `` Just like the zits _ another one can pop up in its place.''

<TEXT>
 After enduring more than a decade of <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s smug silence and denials, relatives of his acknowledged victims found a chilling relief in his 11th-hour admission of a life of rape and murder `` The only thing I can say is thank God, it's finally over,'' said <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Rancourt </PERSON> of LaConner, whose 18-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>, disappeared April 17, 1974. In the days before his execution Tuesday, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> confessed to her slaying. But an investigator who heard some of <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s confessions said there were crimes the serial killer would n't talk about and secrets he took with him to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s electric chair. The 42-year-old <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, who was convicted of murdering three people in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, admitted killing 23 other women after a decade of denial, but he left a legacy of frustration for those who suspect he killed many more. No one knows the enormity of <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s crimes. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials said years ago he might be implicated in 36 slayings throughout the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s confessions included deaths to which he had not previously been linked, such as two in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, and he did not give specifics on at least 10 others in which he was a suspect. `` I do n't think we have even scratched the surface with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>,'' Sheriff <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, said after the execution. `` Somewhere there is someone <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> has told the whole story to.'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> confessed to eight <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> killings, but because he identified only two victims there, authorities said many cases may never be solved. Investigators said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> would not answer when asked about his connection to two <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> deaths in which he is a suspect, including the October 1974 strangulation and beating death of <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Aime </PERSON>, 17, of <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. But there was no doubt Tuesday in the mind of her mother that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> killed her child. `` He needed to die very badly,'' <PERSON> Shirlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Aime </PERSON> said, but she conceded the last minutes of waiting for his execution were `` horrible.'' `` It made me feel guilty,'' she said. `` Despite all the things he did to my daughter and all the other girls, I started to think, ` How low am I, waiting for a man to die?''' Her long-sought relief at <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s death was slow to come, she said. `` I still have this empty feeling. I'm sick to my stomach. It's an uptight, horrible feeling But it is a relief to know he's gone, and he wo n't do it again.'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was executed for the 1978 rape and murder of 12-year-old <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. He also was convicted of killing two women in 1978 at a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sorority house. His gush of confessions in the four days before his electrocution did not include those deaths. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Keppel </PERSON>, an investigator for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state attorney general, said the law student dropout from <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> was unwilling in interviews to talk about some cases that gave him `` painful memories,'' and balked at confessing to deaths before 1973. `` That seemed to be where he drew the line,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION>, who spent about two hours during the weekend extracting confessions from a shaken, tearful Bundy. <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> denied kidnapping and killing 8-year-old <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> in 1961, when <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> would have been just 14. But the way <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> talked about that crime, he left doubt about whether he might have been responsible, <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> disappeared from her parents' <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> home, near where <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s family lived, during an early morning rainstorm. No clue to her fate has ever been found, though there have been years of speculation _ including that of <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>'s parents _ that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was to blame. `` He denied that he did it,'' <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> said. `` But he kind of offered some qualifiers. He told me he was too young at the time. He told me, ` Serial killers start a little older than that.' And he said, ` The neighborhoods were so far apart.' And he said his newspaper route was n't close to the Burr residence.'' <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> said Tuesday she feels strongly that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was responsible for her daughter's disappearance, but added: `` If it was <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, then there's no way we're going to find out. We ca n't do much. We're helpless.'' <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> said his opportunity to question <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was limited to Friday and Sunday, when the killer gave considerable detail about the string of eight `` Ted'' murders in 1974 in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area. But time ran out before he could get details on other killings. `` He told me that he would never talk about some cases because they were too close and too painful to talk about,'' he said.

 Police found some of the `` hot buns'' but not the `` hamburglar'' who stole 150 rolls from a fast-food restaurant.

Five trays, each containing 30 of Big Mac rolls, were taken from a storage area of the restaurant. The restaurant's manager later received an anonymous telephone tip that the rolls could be found in a vacant house less than a mile away, according to a police report. Police searched the house and recovered four of the missing trays still loaded with rolls. One tray of 30 rolls, worth $ 20, was not found, police said.

<HEAD>Employment Costs Rose 5.0 Percent in 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Employment costs rose 5 percent last year because of higher Social Security taxes and rising benefit costs while wage and salary gains lagged behind inflation, according to government data. The 5 percent rise in the cost of wages, salaries and employer-paid benefits in 1988 compares with a 3.6 percent increase in 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday in releasing its quarterly Employment Cost Index. Part of the overall increase in employment costs was attributed to the increase in the employer's Social Security tax rate in January 1988 from 7.15 percent to 7.51 percent. Rising health insurance premiums were cited as a major factor in the 6.8 percent increase in benefit costs to private employers in 1988 _ another force in driving overall employment costs up. The 6.8 percent increase in that area was nearly double the 3.5 percent jump in benefit costs reported in 1987 and came after three years of virtually identical growth in those costs. Although employment costs rose, the rate of wage and salary increases lagged behind inflation for the second consecutive year. The increase was 4.1 percent in 1988, much closer to inflation than the 3.3 percent hike reported for 1987. Inflation averaged 4.4 percent both years. Continued low unemployment, which increases the competition for available workers, was cited by analysts as the major reason for the accelerated growth in wages in 1988 compared to 1987. `` It's clearly the decline in the unemployment rate,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm. `` There is less available labor out there in the market, and it's harder to find what you want.'' According to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, employment costs rose by 5.6 percent among state and local governments in 1988, up from 4.4 percent in 1987. It cost private industry employers 4.9 percent more last year to pay wages, salaries and benefits than it did in 1987, the department said, compared with a 3.3 percent increase in 1987 over 1986. Federal government employment costs are not included in the report. Sales workers, whose pay is heavily influenced by commissions, experienced a 6.6 percent wage gain in 1988, up from just a 1 percent gain in 1987. Workers in the rapidly expanding service sector of the economy experienced wage and salary gains of 4.7 percent, while those working in goods-producing industries saw their pay increase on average by 3.1 percent. For the fifth consecutive year non-union workers in private industry received greater wage and salary increases than did their unionized counterparts, with the increases averaging 4.5 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively. State and local government workers received on average a 4.8 percent pay gain in 1988, up from 4.2 percent in 1987, with the increase in that sector highest among elementary and secondary school employees, predominantly teachers, who averaged 5.7 percent pay raises last year.

 Combat veteran <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessi </PERSON> is hoping that by returning to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> _ where most everyone in his battalion was either wounded or killed _ he can exorcise the demons that still haunt him after 20 years. `` Whenever I think of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ... I get real sad ... for the people who were killed uselessly, both Vietnamese and American,'' said <PERSON> Kessi </PERSON>. `` If I go back and actually see the territory again _ that it is different, that there is n't that big a bogeyman out there that will cause the same thing to happen for my sons, maybe I can come to peace with it.'' <PERSON> Kessi </PERSON>, 43, seven other veterans, two group therapists and a documentary film crew were to leave tonight for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The veterans will spend three weeks traveling through the country and undergoing intensive psychiatric therapy. <PERSON> Kessi </PERSON> said guilt was a big problem when his one-year <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> tour was over. `` My first month in the field, my best friend from training drowned with six other guys'' while patrolling a river in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kessi </PERSON> said. `` When I got back 12 months later, I think I was the only guy out of 18 guys signed to my battalion with me who was n't injured or dead. Upon his return in January 1969, <PERSON> Kessi </PERSON> buried his memories and built a succession of businesses, dabbling in construction, real estate and commodities. `` I could build up something, do real well, and then destroy it. Out of guilt,'' he said. `` I'm not supposed to be good. Why did I survive and nobody else did?'' Perhaps he will find some answers in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, the group's first stop. From there, they will go through several other cities, mostly by bus, ending up in <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, formerly <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>. They also will visit the sites of some of the bloodiest battles of the war, including <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nang </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delta </LOCATION> area. Plans also include meetings with <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> and North Vietnamese army veterans. Dr. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Scurfield </PERSON>, director of the post-traumatic stress disorder program at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, will accompany the group and conduct daily sessions. <PERSON> Scurfield </PERSON>, who did psychiatric work in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, said victims of the disorder can develop chronic symptoms that include walking nightmares, numbing, helplessness, fear that leads to rage, fear that leads to grief, anger against authority and `` the system'' and an inability to control emotions and actions. The disorder often responds to intensive therapy, he said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Koutrouba </PERSON>, 46, who was an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> medic with three tours of duty in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, came up with the idea for the trip following a discussion about the Oscar-winning movie `` Platoon.'' <PERSON> Koutrouba </PERSON> won three Silver Stars and was nominated for the Medal of Honor. Now, he says, the disorder has left him disabled. <PERSON> Kessi </PERSON> enrolled in the program two years ago, and has been trying to strip away his defenses to find out why he feels so isolated and angry. `` I have no idea what it's going to be like when I get there,'' he said. `` I had promised some of my men, I was a sergeant, that I would return in 20 years and take a tour of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The feeling is to pay homage to the people that were n't leaving. To our friends, to our buddies. `` If I had one wish about this trip, it would be that I could come back with less guilt, because I'm guilt-driven. And with less sadness, and maybe with some reason why all those guys died.''

 Federal safety officials have been asked by a private advocacy group to order the recall of 1.9 million <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> pickup trucks because they allegedly are prone to catch fire.

 Buoyed by signs of life, rescuers braved deadly fumes today in an attempt to reach about 100 men believed sealed for nearly five days in a gold mine by a deliberately set fire and a collapse, officials said. `` Rescue teams have been working intensively through the night,'' <LOCATION> Nazca </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said early today in a telephone interview. Three miners were found dead and three rescued Tuesday at the mouth of the Sol de Oro mine near <LOCATION> Nazca </LOCATION>, 230 miles south of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Energy Minister <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrasco </PERSON> reported Tuesday that rescuers heard tapping from the tunnels, indicating someone was alive. He said rescuers `` tapped the walls and heard a faint response.'' <PERSON> Carrasco </PERSON> said there were conflicting reports of 15 to 200 miners trapped in the mine, which <LOCATION> Nazca </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> said collapsed Monday after a fire ravaged wooden tunnel supports. Rescuers reduced that number Tuesday to about 100. <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> said the men have been trapped inside the mine since Saturday, when fire prevented their escape. <PERSON> Carrasco </PERSON> told reporters on his return to <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> following a visit to the mine site that opposing groups of miners set the fires during a dispute. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Andina </ORGANIZATION> said miners were battling over a newly discovered vein that was yielding about 4.5 pounds of gold daily. Officials said fallen earth, smoke and poison gas had prevented rescuers from entering the mine until Tuesday, when teams of specialists from state mines and <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> reached the site. The fire started in the mine Friday after gas lamps used for lighting set ablaze wooden tunnel supports on the second level, <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> said. That fire was controlled, he continued, but it flared again on Saturday, and miners working inside were blocked from leaving by heavy smoke. <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> said the miners were believed to be on the second, third and fourth levels of the five-level mine, which extends about 1,000 feet into a half-mile-high hill on <LOCATION> Nazca </LOCATION>'s outskirts. Officials said the mine had not been used commercially for about a year, but area farmers and others have been mining it on an independent basis for extra cash. <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> said about 900 men using mainly picks and shovels have each extracted up to a gram of gold a day, valued at $ 10, for sale to the state mining company <ORGANIZATION> Minero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peru </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carrasco </PERSON> said two of the rescued men had been hospitalized and a third was only slightly injured. <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> said two of the three bodies recovered at the mouth of the mine showed `` signs of having died from poison gases.'' Mining is <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s most important industry and accounts for more than half of its foreign exchange. Gold production averages about $ 60 million yearly and is the nation's fifth leading mineral behind copper, silver, lead and zinc.

 <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> directed his players to speak `` trippingly on the tongue,'' but the latest players to tackle another of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s tragic heroes, Othello, do n't speak at all. `` Silent Othello,'' the latest production of the 4-year-old Italian American Theater, tells the tale of the Moor of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> without the bard's poetry, and also without sets or secondary characters. The five actors on the bare nightclub stage rely instead on mime, dance motions and traditional Italian gestures _ most of them impolite. `` We do n't pretend it's <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, but you could consider it a mirror to <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>,'' director <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcori </PERSON> recently said after the first of six weekly performances. `` We do n't have the verbal techniques to do spoken <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, but we have other techniques we can use to tell a story,'' he said. `` Othello is the cleanest, dramatically, of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s tragedies. It's a fairly simple story of jealousy and revenge.'' Even before <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s time, it was an Italian story: the tale of how Otello Moro, the Venetian governor of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, was led by misguided jealousy to strangle his wife, <PERSON> Desdemona </PERSON>. In `` Silent Othello,'' that jealousy is stage-managed, as in <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, by the villainous Iago, but this time Iago is a woman, <PERSON> Kaja </PERSON> <PERSON> Overstreet </PERSON>, the only cast member not of Italian ancestry. Ms. <PERSON> Overstreet </PERSON>'s training is in dance and Japanese theater, and she dispenses with the subtleties of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s Iago, creating instead a demonic elf. `` Everything I've studied is very gestural,'' Ms. <PERSON> Overstreet </PERSON> said. `` I'm very visual. I do n't care about the delivery or narrative.'' Using the moves of the Buto theater she studied in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Overstreet </PERSON> establishes Iago's villainy at the outset with the mere lighting of a cigarette. Later, with snakelike motions, she puts the horns of the deceived husband on Othello in the very act of `` consoling'' him. <PERSON> Gino </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGrazia </PERSON>, as Othello, uses restrained movements through most of the 40-minute performance to suggest a dignified Venetian general. But after strangling <PERSON> Desdemona </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Dame </PERSON>, he reverts to his African heritage, smearing himself with her lipstick and doing a voodoo-inspired dance before committing suicide. <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottari </PERSON>, who plays the double role of <LOCATION> Roderigo </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Brabantio </PERSON>, said the production was based largely on the ideas of <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Fo </PERSON>, a contemporary playwright and comedian who draws on the traditions of Italian folk comedy. `` We're attempting to create an Italian-American kind of cultural entity,'' said <PERSON> Bottari </PERSON>, who has been performing in `` guerrilla theater'' since the 1960s. `` Italian-Americans have arrived economically and politically, but we have n't really arrived at the level of culture our families left behind.''

<HEAD>Five Faulty MX Missiles Found, Report Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> removed the 10-warhead payload from five MX missiles late last year, several months after an accident in which a missile came loose and fell in its underground silo, a published report says. The service is still trying to decide how to repair the five missiles, which account for 10 percent of the nation's MX force, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Despite taking the warheads off five missiles, the service still claimed last month that the MX had reached `` full operational capability'' on Dec. 30. The decision to remove the warheads followed an incident last June in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. According to the newspaper, one of the missiles became `` unglued'' from its underground launch canister. The missile fell six inches to a foot and had to undergo extensive repairs, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting unnamed <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials. An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> investigating panel concluded that the missile was one of a batch of five which had production problems, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. Air Force officials responded to the report by ordering removal of the 10-warhead package atop each of the five suspect missiles, according to the newspaper. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has been authorized to build 50 of the missiles and deploy them in underground silos in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. The weapon will join the Minuteman as the core of the nation's land-based nuclear missile deterrent force. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has not publicly released details of the two incidents and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials contacted Tuesday night said they had no information on them. In the incident last June, a key electrical wire was cut. The wire is normally severed during launch and may have briefly caused concern that the weapon was being launched, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. But <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials told the newspaper there was no danger of an accidental launch.

 Records of American troop movements in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> prove that thousands of soldiers were in areas heavily sprayed by the herbicide Agent Orange in the 1960s, according to two scientists whose methods are heavily criticized by the government, a published report says. The findings by <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stellman </PERSON> that thousands of troops were exposed to the cancer-causing herbicide challenge statements by federal officials that they have been unable to find enough soldiers exposed to heavy spraying to reach any meaningful conclusions. The two epidemiologists planned to present their findings today to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Twelve million gallons of Agent Orange were sprayed in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> from 1965 to 1970 to defoliate jungles and cropland where enemy troops were thought to be hiding. The herbicide contains dioxin, the most toxic chemical known. A tiny amount of dioxin causes cancer, immune system depression and birth defects in laboratory animals. The Stellmans found that half the 35 combat battalions they have examined so far were in areas near <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> during or soon after the time Agent Orange was sprayed in the 1967 and 1968. They said the evidence of exposure is so strong that veterans should be contacted, checked for health effects and informed of possible future problems. `` When I look at those levels of exposure, I get a lump in my throat,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stellman </PERSON>, an associate professor of public health at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have several units that were right in the midst of very heavy spraying.'' Her husband, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Stellman </PERSON>, an assistant health commissioner in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said, `` Those men are at higher risk for a variety of health problems.'' But <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Houk </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, said the Stellmans were `` turning logic on its head'' by ignoring blood tests in favor of historical records. The Stellmans said blood analysis such as those used by the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> are not a valid measure of dioxin 20 years after exposure. The Stellmans are helping a federal court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> determine who is eligible for compensation from the manufacturers as part of a 1984 court settlement with exposed veterans.

 Ten Tibetan monks have begun a month-long project that brings an ancient <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> tradition to the West: butter sculpture. No, not the statue of a cow they had at the state fair, and not the carved swan you once saw on a banquet table. These sculptures, begun Tuesday in an unheated hall at the American Museum of Natural History, are astonishingly intricate, brightly colored religious offerings, created in a ritualistic manner that dates back more than six centuries. `` We devote ourselves to this way of life, which is now under great stress,'' said one of the monks, <PERSON> Thubten </PERSON> <PERSON> Jigme </PERSON>, after he carried a tub of ice water to the demonstration area. `` We're delighted to let people know about our culture and our art. Organizers with the museum and <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> say it's the first time large-scale traditional butter sculpture has been shown in the West. Wearing bright yellow and red robes, the monks began their work with several minutes of distinctive harmonic chanting. Individual voices somehow produced three-tone chords and the chorus of 10 sounded at once ominous and soothing. Then, to work. The men from the Gyuto Tantric Monastery in <LOCATION> Bomdila </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, will stay in a private home for the next six weeks, rising before dawn to chant for hours, then settling in to work on the sculptures from 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. They create individual pie-sized pieces of art _ abstract flowers, concentric designs called mandalas and other symbols _ as well as miniature sculptures of horses, elephants and six-armed figures called Mahakalas. These will be attached to an 8-foot wooden frame, all to show Americans how the Tibetan monks celebrate the new year in February. The `` butter'' is actually a vegetable product _ the preferred yak butter is virtually unavailable _ refined from the seeds of a certain species of tree that grows in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Konchok </PERSON> <PERSON> Wangdu </PERSON>, abbot of the monastery, said he hoped the demonstration will encourage Americans `` to learn extensively about <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, her history, her culture and her art.'' `` Because of the Chinese occupation of the past 30 years, these arts have been extinguished, and those people who do them are becoming extinct,'' he said. More than 100,000 Tibetans fled their homeland and Chinese domination in 1959.

 Hours before his execution, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> coolly traced his origins as a serial killer, describing how boyhood glimpses of violent pornography became `` an addiction'' that grew until his `` destructive energy'' exploded from fantasy into reality. The 42-year-old law school dropout, whose bizarre mixture of intelligence, charm and homicidal bloodlust were the subject of five books and a TV movie, also warned before his execution Tuesday that there were others like himself. `` There are loose in the towns and their communities people like me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in, day out, by violence in the media ... particularly sexual violence,'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said in a videotaped interview Monday. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, who after a decade of denial told detectives from four states that he had murdered 23 young women since the mid-1970s, said he deserved his punishment. His execution in the electric chair at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> elicited cheers from more than 100 people who stood in a field across from the penitentiary. `` I do n't want to die, I'm not going to kid you. ... -LRB- but -RRB- I deserve, certainly, the most extreme punishment society has. I think society deserves to be protected from me and from others like me,'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said in the interview with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, a religious broadcaster and psychologist. He said between sobs he hoped the interview would spur society to protect itself from the widespread influence of pornography, TV violence, X-rated movies. Although he said he felt remorse for the sex-related murders, which authorities believes could total 36 nationwide, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said, `` There is no way in the world that killing me is going to restore those beautiful children to their parents.'' Handcuffed and sitting at a table across from <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> alternately sobbed and smiled during the 29-minute interview. He was dressed in the peach-colored, short-sleeved shirt worn by Death Row inmates. He appeared to ponder each question carefully, sometimes pausing at length before answering articulately. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, who has a daily radio program heard on 1,200 radio stations, asked about the rape and murder of 12-year-old <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, for which <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was executed. `` What did you feel after that?'' <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> held his hands to his face, closed his eyes and thought for a long time before responding: `` I ca n't talk about that right now. ... It's too painful. ... I ca n't begin to understand the pain that the parents of these children -LRB- felt -RRB-. `` I do n't ask them to forgive me. I'm not asking for it. That kind of forgiveness is of God.'' Prodded by <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> to explore the sources of his violence, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said that during his murder rampages `` the unique thing about how this worked ... is I still felt in my regular life the full range of guilt and remorse about other things.'' But the murders, he said, were `` compartmentalized'' in his brain, a `` very well focused, very sharply focused area that was a black hole that was like a crack and everything that fell into that crack hole just disappeared.'' He emphasized he did n't blame pornography for his actions and took full responsibility. But he said hard-core pornography, fueled by alcohol, `` guided and shaped'' what he did. `` I have lived in prison for a long time now, and I've met a lot of men who were motivated to violence just like me. And without exception, every one of them was deeply involved in pornography,'' he said. Claiming he was `` essentially a normal person'' who grew up in a good home, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said: `` People need to recognize ... those of us who are or who have been so much influenced by violence in the media, in particular pornographic violence, are not some kind of inherent monsters. We are your sons and we are your husbands and we grew up in regular families. And pornography can reach out and snatch a kid out of any house today.'' But Dr. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Otnow </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a psychiatrist who examined <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> as part of a last-ditch attempt to save him from execution, said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s first home was that of his maternal grandparents, with a grandfather who was `` an extremely violent and frightening individual.'' The grandfather would kick dogs, swing cats by their tails, beat people who angered him and read pornography voraciously, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, psychiatrist said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said a cousin told her that when <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was a preschooler in the home in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, he used to sneak into a greenhouse where his grandfather's pornography was kept and read it. In the interview, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said his desire to murder `` happened in stages, gradually. ... Once you become addicted to -LRB- pornography -RRB-, and I look at this as a kind of addiction like other kinds of addiction, I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. `` You keep craving something that is harder, harder, something which, which gives you a greater sense of excitement. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes so far, you reach that jumping-off point where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing it would give you that which is beyond just reading it or looking at it. `` In the beginning it fuels this kind of thought process, then at a certain time, it is instrumental, I would say crystallizing, making into something which is almost like a separate entity inside. ... a building up of this destructive energy.'' After committing his first murder, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said, he was `` absolutely horrified that I was capable of doing something like that.'' `` It was like coming out of some horrible trance,'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said. `` It was like being possessed by something so awful, so alien. `` But then the impulse to do it again would come back even stronger.''

 Persistent human rights abuses by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> include the punishment of people who seek to emigrate, harsh treatment of prisoners and the conducting of secret trials, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said today. While the Communist government has loosened up some travel restrictions, some people caught trying to flee have been charged with espionage, the London-based human rights organization said. Amnesty said `` a clear pattern of human rights abuse'' exists in the country of 16.6 million people but said official secrecy and the government's refusal to respond in detail to various allegations make it difficult to obtain a complete picture. Western leaders last week sharply criticized <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s record on the issue during a human rights conference in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has been resisting calls for reforms along the lines of those initiated in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Amnesty said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s `` secret trials, secret directives to lawyers and vaguely defined laws make it possible for the authorities to penalize almost any activity of which they disapprove.'' Young East Germans, with the support of part of the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, have been clamoring for greater freedom, including the ability to travel outside the Soviet bloc. Amnesty quoted some East Germans as saying their applications to emigrate were turned down because the stated reasons were `` not sufficient.'' `` Others have reported that the officials said that the application was ` illegal' without indicating which laws had been broken,'' the organization said in a report. The East Germans have eased travel restrictions after years of pressure from Western leaders. Western estimates say 1.5 million people have applied to emigrate from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Many leave illegally _ more than 9,700 in 1988. Amnesty said there have been cases of people being charged with espionage if they had access to `` sensitive information'' and later tried to flee. `` In such cases, no information has in fact been passed on because the person was apprehended before this was possible,'' said report says. It notes that stating one's reasons for wishing to leave <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> can be considered the crime of `` public vilification.'' `` The ` vilification' is considered public if, for example, a copy of the application for an exit visa is sent to a higher authority or written on a postcard,'' <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said. Many of those persecuted by the government are would-be emigrants who later turn to foreign organizations in hopes of seeking attention for their case, the report says. It says potential witnesses and defense lawyers can be charged with crimes if they challenge the prosecutor's version of facts in a case. Amnesty said there were also reports of mistreatment in jail. `` One former prisoner complained that the only person she could talk to immediately after arrest was her interrogator and that she almost began to look forward to the daily interrogation sessions as a break from the monotony of isolation in the cell,'' the report says. `` A number of former prisoners have reported that inmates in punishment cells were chained to beds for days on end as punishment, being set free only to go to the toilet or for meals,'' Amnesty reported. Refusal to work was the most common reason for confinement in a punishment cell, a drafty, 6 -LCB- - foot-by-6 -LCB- - foot

<HEAD>DOE Criticizes Savannah River Operators Following New Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal officials say an accident that occurred during testing at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> is another sign that problems at the nuclear facility are out of control. `` The issue is not physical damage. The issue is a lack of formality, a lack of discipline,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>, deputy assistant energy secretary, said Tuesday. `` This does n't give you confidence in their ability to handle anomalies.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Engergy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the plant's operator, are investigating Sunday's accident. Federal officials said there was no leakage of radiation or other hazardous material. <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> officials said damage has tentatively been estimated at $ 20,000 and will take only a few days to repair. The <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> reactors, which produce plutonium and tritium for the nation's nuclear weapons arsenal, have been shut down since April for safety and maintenance reasons. The impact of the accident on the department's plans to restart the reactor before the end of this summer is uncertain. However, <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> safety officials say the incident, which comes at a time when safety of the nation's nuclear weapons complex is under intense congressional scrutiny, casts new doubts on the ability of plant operators to run <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION>'s three nuclear reactors. <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s top safety official, said the incident was further evidence that suggested `` a lack of control over what's going on in the reactors. He said the mishap at the K reactor closely parallels earlier problems at the P reactor in August, when operators failed to shut down the reactor when they were confronted with erratic power levels. The latest problem began Thursday with a test of a portion of the reactor system that uses water from the nearby <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to help keep the radioactive core cool during normal operations. During the test, operators opened a valve to divert water from one segment of the cooling system to the portion being tested, according to <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Merz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s technology superintendent. <PERSON> Merz </PERSON> said problems began when the operators forgot to close the valve after the test. Unaware that the valve was still open, other operators on Sunday began a test of another portion of the cooling system. When water pressure in the portion of the cooling system they were testing failed to increase as expected, they incorrectly assumed the problem was inadequate pumping capacity. <PERSON> Merz </PERSON> said the operators then switched on a second pump, which created enough force to break the valve. He said that caused water to surge through the entire system at up to six times the normal pressure level. `` Rather than take a prudent course of action when they were n't getting the numbers they expected during a test, which would have been to stop the test, somebody elected to turn on another pump,'' <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> officials ordered a halt to further maintenance and testing at the K reactor. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says that work must be conducted before a restart can be attempted. <PERSON> Merz </PERSON> said the company's initial investigation suggests that operators failed to explicitly instruct technicians to close the valve in question after the test Thursday. But <PERSON> Merz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, <PERSON> DOE </PERSON>'s acting director for reactor assessment at <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that the faulty decision by operators during the Sunday test was a bigger mistake. `` They should have stopped,'' <PERSON> Merz </PERSON> said. `` They were seeing something different than what was expected as far as the pressure levels, and the correct action would have been to halt the test and call in the engineers and figure out what was happening.'' He said <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> is considering taking disciplinary action against the operators involved. <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> said the DOE is investigating the matter, including a delay in reporting the problem to top plant officials. He said word of the mishap Sunday night did not reach the department's managers at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> until Tuesday.

 A Soviet-American dog sledding team plans to make a 1,200-mile goodwill trek across the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>, the first officially sanctioned crossing since 1948. Ten men and two women _ six Soviets and six Americans _ will depart March 1 from <LOCATION> Anadyr </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, on the two-month journey, visiting 30 native settlements along an old Arctic trade route. `` Some of the team members have relatives on the other side,'' so the visits could get emotional, said expedition co-leader <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schurke </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. The expedition is an effort to call attention to the common cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> region, <PERSON> Schurke </PERSON> said at a news conference Tuesday at the swanky <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION> restaurant. And since villagers in the remote region rarely get out-of-town visitors, he said, they are expecting big welcomes, especially from children who will probably get the day off from school to ski along with the team. The Soviet co-leader is <PERSON> Dmitry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shparo </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, who in 1979 won his country's highest honor, the Order of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, for successfully leading a ski expedition to the North Pole. Last year, he was a member of a Soviet-Canadian trek across the polar ice cap from the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, called the <ORGANIZATION> Bering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Expedition </ORGANIZATION> `` another step toward melting the ice curtain.'' <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, who attended Tuesday's news conference, noted that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is working on a treaty with the Soviets to permit American Eskimos to visit and trade with their counterparts in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> without visas. In 1938, the two countries signed an agreement that enabled travel in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> region, but it was abrogated in 1948 during the iciest days of the Cold War. In the spirit of adventure diplomacy, the team hopes a new agreement can be signed at a ceremony at the U.S.-Soviet border around April 1. `` When you're only 2 -LCB- miles from your neighbor, it should n't take 40 years to renew your relationship,'' said <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, referring to the narrow strait between the islands of Big <PERSON> Diomede </PERSON> and <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Diomede </PERSON>, the narrowest distance between the superpowers. `` The <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> is the shortest distance between the two greatest powers in the world,'' said <PERSON> Schurke </PERSON>, who made an unassisted trek to the North Pole in 1986. `` Yet it remains a cold reminder of untapped potential for exchange. We are looking forward to setting an example for the world and uniting a people too long divided.''

 Reputed mob boss <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, who according to his attorney `` has never run away from a problem,'' walked out of a courtroom free on bail after being accused of ordering the shooting of a construction union official. `` Did I ever worry yet?'' a smiling <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> asked reporters waiting for him as he arrived back at his home 20 hours after being arrested by dozens of law officers on a street in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` I have nothing to worry about.'' At a bail hearing Tuesday, the prosecution asked that <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> be held without bail, arguing that the reputed head of the Gambino crime family had access to massive sums of mob money and would flee if freed. <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>'s income is `` literally that of the family,'' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherkasky </PERSON> told acting Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. `` His financial resources are enormous. He's gambled on numerous occasions and lost enormous sums of money. We're counting in the hundreds of thousands of dollars,'' <PERSON> Cherkasky </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> has strong family ties here and had never failed to appear for a court date. `` He's not going no place. He has never run away from a problem,'' <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> set <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>'s bail at $ 100,000, and about an hour later the 48-year-old <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> _ dressed in the same tailored brown suit and yellow turtleneck he wore when he was arrested Monday _ was back on the streets. At a news conference Tuesday, District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> released a grand jury indictment that accused <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> and two associates of conspiring to order the shooting of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who allegedly had a restaurant vandalized for using non-union carpenters. `` It was the specific goal and intention of the conspiracy to punish <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, and thereby reaffirm the authority of the Gambino crime family over all others who might challenge it,'' according to the indictment, which charges <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> and the other two men with conspiracy and first-degree assault. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, vice president and business manager of Local 608 of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carpenters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joiners </ORGANIZATION>, was shot four times in the May 1986 attack, but survived. Law enforcement officials said <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> apparently did not know the restaurant, <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brokers </ORGANIZATION> in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, was managed by an alleged associate of the Gambino organization, the nation's most powerful crime family <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> codefendant <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Guerrieri </PERSON>, 60, a reputed soldier in <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>'s organization, was freed on $ 50,000 bail. Both men pleaded innocent. The judge ordered the two to return to court Monday. The third man indicted, <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruggiero </PERSON>, identified as a captain in the Gambino family, was placed in custody at a hospital where he is undergoing cancer treatment, and will be arraigned later, <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said investigators learned through electronic surveillance that a contract to shoot <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> had been given by the Gambino group to the leader of the Westies, a gang that operated on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. Several members of the Westies were named as co-conspirators in the indictment, but were not charged. A missing member of the gang, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, was indicted in absentia in September 1986 on attempted murder charges for the <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> shooting. Law-enforcement officials believe <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> has been killed.

 African students who want to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because they say the Chinese are racist asked the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> today for money to pursue their studies elsewhere. <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> <PERSON> Traore </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Tuesday for his third visit since 1973 and was met at the airport by a delegation of Malian students from universities around <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Traore </PERSON> was given a letter asking him to help African students leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the African students said. The <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> has recently criticized <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for its treatment of African students. `` African students feel menaced by a climate of insecurity which is implicitly encouraged by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities,'' said a copy of the letter obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We would like to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> not only with the aim of returning to our respective countries but with an aim of continuing our studies in countries where living conditions will be favorable,'' the letter says. It asks the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> to provide the students with scholarships `` to enable us continue our studies.'' Most of the 1,500 African students in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are on Chinese government scholarships. It was not clear how many of them the letter represented. Telephone calls to the <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION> Embassy for comment were not answered. A brawl on Dec. 24 at a university in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> triggered anti-African protests by Chinese in several cities and attacks on African students' dormitories in that city. Today, about 500 Africans continued a class boycott that began Jan. 4 at the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Languages </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and about half the 140 African students in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> remained on strike there. Chinese authorities on Tuesday released <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Dosoo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, the last of three African students arrested in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> for allegedly taking part in the Christmas Eve brawl. <PERSON> Dosoo </PERSON> had been under house arrest at a guest house in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> for 11 days and in jail the previous two weeks. In a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dosoo </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities told him he could continue his studies in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He said he would rather return home. <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> protested <PERSON> Dosoo </PERSON>'s arrest and threatened to withdraw its 26 students from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Most of the other African embassies have been silent on the issue. <PERSON> Dosoo </PERSON>'s release appeared aimed at lessening any problems <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> might have with <PERSON> Traore </PERSON> during his visit. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has long courted <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in its attempt to be a leader of the Third World. An official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> report on <PERSON> Traore </PERSON>'s visit late tonight stressed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s strong ties to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Strengthening cooperation with Third World nations, including those of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, is the cornerstone of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign policy of independence and peace,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Hundreds of middle-age rock' n' roll fans, insisting that'll be the day when they forget <ORGANIZATION> Buddy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION>, will converge next month at the ballroom where he performed his last concert three decades ago. `` You can forget about the federal deficit, crime or whatever bothers people the rest of the year,'' said <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>, who has taken the annual event from a money-losing spoof to a sold-out attraction. `` They got wife problems?

The 400 others are controlled by the ballroom, a radio station and <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>, with many reserved for performers, press and security. After their concert 30 years ago, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> and fellow rockers <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> `` Big Bopper'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> <PERSON> Valens </PERSON> decided to fly to their next gig rather than take the tour bus. Their small chartered plane crashed into a frozen field shortly after takeoff. There were no survivors. <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>, a radio personality whose on-air name is the Mad Hatter, said there are no special plans for this year's concert. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>'s relatives have attended before, but none has accepted invitations this year <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>, who owns <ORGANIZATION> KDWD </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, said this year's activities begin Feb. 3 with an all-night sock hop featuring'50s and'60s favorites. The next night, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Vee </PERSON>, the Diamonds and <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> `` Boom Boom'' <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> will re-create their hits, along with warm-up groups the Rockin' Ricochettes of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Blazing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broncos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>. The $ 45 ticket provides admission to both nights. <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON> first was host of the concert as a radio personality and owner of <ORGANIZATION> KZEV </ORGANIZATION> radio in <LOCATION> Clear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, now owned by his ex-wife, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>. `` I was just doing a spoof on the radio show,'' he said. `` I was brand new in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and I explained that we had built the studio by mistake in a time warp. Buddy and <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> talked to me each morning. ... Buddy thought it was strange that nobody put on a concert in his memory, and <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> said, ` Yeah, man, we got to do this for Buddy.' `` Then some guy from <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> called and asked if I was really going to do it. So we did,'' he said. `` People from 30 to 50 or 60, they're reliving 1959. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> wrote that song -LRB- `` American Pie'' -RRB- about the day the music died. I think he was premature,'' said <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> is still living today, bigger and better than ever.''

<HEAD>Eight Arrested In Wenceslas Square Face Charges Of Hooliganism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eight Czech activists who were arrested last week while trying to place flowers on <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s Wenceslas Square face charges of disturbing the public and hooliganism, an informed source said today. Prominent playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and 15 others were detained after the eight tried to lay flowers in memory of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, a student who burned himself alive 20 years ago to protest the death of the `` Prague Spring'' reforms after the Soviet-led invasion of 1968. Five of that group were released last weekend but may also be tried, dissidents in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> said this week. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, like the other eight still in prison, will likely be prosecuted separately, said the source, who was reached by telephone from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. The source, who asked not to be identified, said the lawyers of the eight accused dissidents were summoned to the prison Tuesday and informed of the results of a police probe. Under Czechoslovak law, both the accused and their lawyers must be informed of the outcome of such an investigation before the charges are presented to the public prosecutor. According to the source, if convicted they face a maximum penalty of two years in prison. The eight were identified as <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemcova </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Vondra </PERSON>, spokesmen for the Charter 77 human rights group, <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Penc </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrova </PERSON>, <PERSON> Otakar </PERSON> <PERSON> Veverka </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Sternova </PERSON>, also a senior Charter 77 member, as well as <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Placak </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemec </PERSON> of the Czech Children group. Two other people arrested on Jan. 16, <PERSON> Jitka </PERSON> <PERSON> Vavsikova </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiala </PERSON>, have not been heard of since, and it was not clear if they are still under arrest, said sources in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. In addition to hooliganism, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> also faces additional charges for having called for an unauthorized demonstration in interviews with foreign media Jan. 9-15, the source in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> said.

<HEAD>Psychiatrist: Bundy's Mental Problems May Have Dated From Infancy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Bundy, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A psychiatrist who examined <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> as part of a last-ditch attempt to save him from execution concluded that the confessed serial killer probably started developing psychological problems as an infant. Dr. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Otnow </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> first lived in the home of his maternal grandparents in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, with a grandfather who was `` an extremely violent and frightening individual.'' The grandfather would kick dogs, swing cats by their tails, beat people who angered him and read pornography voraciously, she said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> interviewed <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> on Monday as his attorneys tried unsuccessfully to prove he was mentally incompetent to be executed. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was electrocuted Tuesday morning at the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> State Prison. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' findings were published in detail in Tuesday editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, offering a possible glimpse into the mind of a man linked to as many as three dozen killings in the West and in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. In the days before he died, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> confessed to 23 deaths. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said a cousin told her that when <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was a preschooler, he used to sneak into a greenhouse where his grandfather's pornography was kept and read it Hours before his death, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, 42, said that pornography fueled his violent thoughts toward women. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> exhibited bizarre behavior at his grandparents' house, the psychiatrist said. At age 3, he appeared several times at the bedside of his 15-year-old aunt, lifting the covers and placing butcher knives beside her. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s maternal grandmother had been hospitalized more than once for psychotic depression and had undergone electroshock therapy. Later in life, the woman had a severe phobia against leaving her house. Such things could indicate <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> had a genetic predisposition to mental illness, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` The whole family felt that -LRB- <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s mother -RRB- <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> and her son had to be rescued from the home,'' a family member told <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. In the interviews with <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> repeatedly said he had only fond memories of his grandfather, apparently blocking out incidents described by other family members and indicating to <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> had been `` horribly traumatized'' as a child. She said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, born <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowell </PERSON> in a <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, home for unwed mothers, finally moved with his mother to <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, where other relatives lived. There, his mother met and married <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, a hospital cook, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> adopted <PERSON> Ted </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> determined <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> suffered from a `` bipolar mood disorder,'' or a manic-depressive illness that produced violent mood swings in the convicted killer. At a moment's notice, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> could switch from euphoria and compulsive talking to anger followed by long periods of sullen silence, she said. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> almost certainly suffered from this disorder at the time of his <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> trials for killing two <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> women in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, and 12-year-old <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was executed for the latter crime. As evidence of <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s mood swings, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> showed the court a doodle she found in one of <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s college notebooks. It showed two faces: one normal, the other enlarged and with Dracula-like teeth. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> not only did n't recall the doodle, he tried to explain it away by saying he was probably on drugs when it was drawn. An example of <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s mood swings occurred when an investigator was in <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s cell in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. The investigator told her that during a normal conversation, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> suddenly `` became weird on me ... did a metamorphosis, a bit of a body and facial change, and ... almost an odor emitted from him.'' The investigator said the incident lasted about 20 minutes, during which there was a `` change of personality with extreme tension ... I was afraid of him ... it was very scary.'' On the day the <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> girl's body was found, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> flew into a rage in his cell, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` He was pacing ... muttering things ... hyperventilating.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, who heard <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' findings, also heard some strong dissent. Dr. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> psychiatrist who talked with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> in a <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> jail in 1976, described <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s hostility as `` mild.'' He said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was `` intellectually efficient and flexible,'' had a good relationship with women and was a `` normal person.'' Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Mutter, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> physician specializing in psychiatry, also said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was sane. `` I think what this man did is brilliant,'' <PERSON> Mutter </PERSON> said in describing the meticulous research Bundy performed in taking 80 or 90 depositions during one of his trials. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Mutter </PERSON>, was `` very logical, very lucid. He has beat two death warrants. Is that insanity?''

<HEAD>Jewish Civil Rights Group Backs Teaching `Values' in School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A major Jewish organization is calling for the renewed teaching of values in American schools, saying there's more cause for concern over moral confusion than over potential church-state conflicts. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says the organization has rejected the argument that values education could be `` a smokescreen for teaching religious precepts.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AJC </ORGANIZATION>, a leading Jewish civil rights organization, is encouraging schools to define, teach `` and put into action'' values that are at the foundation of a democracy. `` You've got to rely on good faith and the integrity of the teaching system,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, the organization's vice president and chairman of the task force that wrote the report. `` The easiest thing to do is -LRB- to say -RRB- let's not touch it because it's too risky,'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. `` I think it's a natural evolution of our attitude and the ability to distinguish between matters of religious faith and shared values.'' The report, to be released next month, is considered significant because of the past reluctance of many groups representing minority religions to enter into the issue. A copy of the report was obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Braveman </PERSON>, the committee's director of education, said she thinks the report could have been written two years ago, `` but it would n't be received as well. There might not be a sense of urgency in it.'' The role of the public school in teaching values is coming under increasing scrutiny as educators and others debate the effect of `` value-free education.'' In a 1986 speech that focused national attention on the issue, Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said, `` When you get kids for eight years in an elementary school and you never say anything to them about values, I suspect what you're saying to them is there are no values.'' A panel of educators brought together by the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Curriculum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> recommended in its final report last year `` that schools define and teach a morality of justice, altruism, diligence and respect for human dignity.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, representing main-line <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denominations, last year launched an experimental program to bring together churches, schools and teacher-education colleges to help communities establish a consensus on values that should be taught. `` I think what happened over the last 20 years ... was a certain kind of moral relativism did enter in. There was confusion about right and wrong,'' said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, the Jewish committee's director of national affairs `` What you have now is a reinsertion of the ethno-cultural-religious traditions and an attempt to develop a consensus around those traditional values.'' The committee's report said that in many cases, religious and civic values are identical. Among these are compassion, a regard for human worth and dignity, integrity and justice. The report said a non-sectarian consensus can be reached on what values should be taught. `` You do n't have enormous controversy over those values. You have enormous controversy over opening a foot in the door for sectarian religion,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. Methods the report suggests for introducing values in the classroom include a `` conflict corner'' where two students could work out their differences and a teacher-moderated `` fairness committee'' to propose solutions to classroom problems. Ms. <PERSON> Braveman </PERSON> gave one example of how values can be taught. She told of a second-grade teacher whose class was incubating 20 chicken eggs for a science project, and suggested opening an egg each week to monitor the eggs' embryonic development. When one student told the teacher privately that he thought it was cruel to kill the chicks, the teacher brought the issue to the class. After a debate about whether chickens were alive before they hatched, whether curiosity was a good enough reason to kill a chick and whether the scientific value of the experiment warranted opening the eggs, the pupils agreed to honor their classmate's objections. The old fear that teaching values would lead to teaching sectarian religious beliefs still is prevalent in the American Jewish community, Ms. <PERSON> Braveman </PERSON> said, but that is no longer the exclusive position. `` There's a desperate sense we need to do something,'' she said. The 50,000-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, aims to protect the civil rights of Jews worldwide.

<TEXT>
 The state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> and Paroles will give quicker consideration of parole for a man whose 1976 conviction for killing a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer was questioned in the movie `` The Thin Blue Line.'' `` I would speculate it would be within the next 30 days,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckmann </PERSON>, the board's executive director. The board on Tuesday granted <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> an expedited parole review, meaning his December review would be moved up. State records show <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 40, who is serving a life sentence, has been denied parole eight times, most recently on Jan. 10. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' parole request was expedited based on information provided by State District Judge <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Karin </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, an information officer with the board. <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> last month ruled that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> did not receive a fair trial in 1977 and recommended he be granted a new one or set free. The key witness against <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> changed his story last month, testifying that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> did n't commit the murder and was n't even in the car police officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> stopped just before he was gunned down. However, the witness, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, stopped short of saying he pulled the trigger himself in <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s slaying. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> is on Death Row for another killing, and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> district attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> has discounted his testimony. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, always maintaining his innocence, contends prosecutors wanted to convict him rather than <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who was only 16 at the time. If convicted as a juvenile, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> would have been released at age 18. `` The Thin Blue Line,'' a documentary by <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, questioned <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' guilt. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> has served more than 12 years in state prison. In 1980, his death sentence was commuted to life. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> also is considering <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON>'s recommendation that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> be given a new trial or set free Attorneys said it could take as long as two years to act on it.

 The pro-Hanoi government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has signed an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee agency to allow <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> refugees to return home from camps along the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border, state radio reported today. An official <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government broadcast said the agreement, signed Monday in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, deals with `` principles and procedures to welcome back voluntarily repatriated Cambodian refugees.'' `` The memorandum has been signed and the <ORGANIZATION> UNHCR </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees -RRB- would be ready to facilitate Cambodian refugees who ... wish to return,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee agency official in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaman </PERSON>. Only about 17,000 of the quarter-million Cambodians along the Thai-Cambodian border are being assisted by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> body, but others could seek transfer to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee camp of <PERSON> Khao </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> and then apply for repatriation, refugee sources said. Large numbers of Cambodians fled violence, starvation and disease as Vietnamese troops invaded their country in late 1978 and ousted the brutal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. Vast camps were set up along the frontier, most of them controlled by various anti-Phnom Penh guerrilla groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. During a news conference last month, <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said his government would be willing to welcome all 250,000 refugees. Refugee officials generally believe most will not seek repatriation because of the continued conflict in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Only about 4,000 Laotian refugees in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> have returned home under a similar <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee program that began in 1985. Last June, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee agency submitted the names of three Cambodian refugees who wished to return to <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> authorities as `` test cases.'' The government has yet to respond to these repatration requests.

<HEAD>At Least 11 Arrested In Northeast's Largest Poaching Sting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eleven people were arrested in a poaching sting that uncovered the slaughter of more than 400 black bears for their gall bladders, which are prized as aphrodisiacs in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` This is just the tip of this particular iceberg,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickford </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION>, Wildlife and <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're aware of numerous other operations like this in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' The arrests were made in raids that began at 6 a.m. Tuesday in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, wildlife officials said. The raids were the culmination of a 2 -LCB- - year investigation that `` tracked approximately $ 50,000 in transactions involving everything from endangered species to black bear gall bladders. `` This operation is the most extensive ever conducted in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> McGroary </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>. Some of the dozens of pelts and gall bladders confiscated in the raids were displayed at a news conference. Among the pelts were those of a mountain lion and several bobcats. Also displayed were videotapes and photographs of 27 bear carcasses piled in a meadow in the Catskills. <PERSON> Bickford </PERSON> said investigators bought at least 360 gall bladders in addition to carcasses and skins. He said the number of black bears apparently slaughtered for their gall bladders nearly equaled the black bear population in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Most of the bears were taken in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, he said. The arresting officers also confiscated boxes of pills that were said to contain small amounts of rhinoceros horn, which hold the same value in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> as the gall bladders. `` This is a primitive superstition,'' said <PERSON> Bickford </PERSON>. `` There is no proof whatsoever'' that the bear organs or rhinoceros horns are aphrodisiacs, he said. The superstition, however, has pushed the street value of dried, powdered black bear gall bladders overseas above that of heroin or cocaine in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bickford </PERSON> said. The powder can sell for $ 540 an ounce or more. The investigation was led by two field officers from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who took part in what <PERSON> Bickford </PERSON> described as strange rituals in their undercover work. One ritual involved christening new pickup trucks `` by building a bed of dead deer carcasses. ... When you're dealing with a group like this, you're talking about some bizarre behavior,'' he said. Three of the arrested people were from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, three more were from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, four from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and one was arrested in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Wildlife officials said more arrests were expected. The arrested people jointly face more than 100 counts, ranging from illegal hunting to practicing taxidermy without a license. Penalties for each count range up to one year in prison and $ 1,000 in fines. The sale of black bear gall bladders is forbidden in most states, although the bears may legally be hunted in many. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, only the sale of the head, hide and hooves of deer is permitted under certain conditions. <PERSON> McGroary </PERSON> said the investigation began when <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> game officials uncovered evidence that a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> meat dealer had illegally supplied venison to a western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> restaurant he refused to identify.

<HEAD>Report: Indian Museum Site Favors Smithsonian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new plan has emerged after years of debate to move the bulk of the nation's largest collection of Indian artifacts from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported today. The Museum of the American Indian would relocate from its <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> site to the Mall in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> would build and operate that museum, as well as a smaller Indian museum in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Although the collection is considered the finest of its kind, it has been virtually invisible in its current location in upper <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, far from the usual tourist areas. The museum is only able to display about 1 percent of the collection, and the rest is stored in a four-story warehouse in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. There has been increasing concern that the collection could be deteriorating. Various plans had been raised for several years to move the collection, which at one point appeared on the verge of being moved to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> officials intervened, pointing out that a trust established for the museum 73 years ago requires that it remain in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Last April, <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> officials rejected a proposal to break the collection into three parts, with one moving to the Mall, one remaining at the old <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> site and another moving into the old <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Custom House in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The newest plan would move a portion to the <ORGANIZATION> Custom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, satisfying the terms of the trust and increasing the museum's visibility in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, an assistant attorney general in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the state had made a major concession in agreeing to give the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> full title to the collection. The attorney general's office is charged with overseeing trusts. The Times said the state has insisted that the customs house be used to display the collection in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said the city and the <ORGANIZATION> Heye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the existing museum, agree with the general provisions of the new proposal. The newspaper said approval of the new proposal hinges on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which must approve funds for a new museum.

<HEAD>Soviets, Feeding the City, Distribute Flour to Factory Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet troops, shouldering what one of their generals has called <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s new task of feeding <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, today distributed 275 tons of airlifted flour and heating fuel to more than 5,000 workers at a state-owned factory. The distribution at a concrete block factory _ in the presence of invited Western correspondents _ was noticeably orderly compared with unruly scenes of Afghan soldiers beating back crowds from Soviet armored personnel carriers during other emergency handouts in the capital last week. The Afghan workers, most of whom maintained still want the Soviet army out of the country, hauled away 150-pound sacks of flour that soldiers unloaded from trucks. Soviet Col. <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovye </PERSON>, asked about reports the Soviets suspect emergency supplies handed over to the Afghan regime wind up with party officials, said merely: `` To do this through the Afghan -LRB- administration -RRB- would take a long time.'' Behind the Soviet-built factory near <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s airport, Ilyushin-76 transport planes were seen landing and taking off in what the Soviets said was the fifth day of a week-long airlift of 400-500 tons daily from the Soviet cities of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION>. Soviet officers said the airlifts will continue as needed when the army completes the scheduled withdrawal of its troops by Feb. 15. It is unclear, however, whether <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will be able to continue feeding this capital's 2.2 million people if Moslem insurgents _ who are already causing severe disrupts for road convoys _ mount an economic blockade aimed at strangling President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s regime after his Soviet protectors withdraw. `` Anything can happen, but I think that -LRB- a blockade -RRB- will remain really just a threat,'' Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON>, deputy head of the Soviet military command in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, told reporters. This week's emergency airlift followed acute shortages in the city last week, with fights breaking out in long lines at bread stores. Western diplomats say the state-owned silo that holds the capital's flour supply is down to less than one day's supply. The Soviets say the city needs 120 tons a day, but Afghan officials say it needs 500 tons. `` It's good they're going, but do n't worry, they'll continue to help us,'' said a 16-year-old who identified himself as <PERSON> Humanani </PERSON>. The youth came with his father to help carry away several sacks of flour for their family of nine. <PERSON> Sayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, a wrinkled 55-year-old, complained: `` For two weeks it's been very hard to get anything.'' Asked what would happen when the Soviet troops go, he looked bewildered. `` Perhaps the government will help us,'' he said. In another development, Western diplomatic sources said <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> military and state security police were making house-to-house searches and hauling off young men for army conscription. Despite evidence of substantial troop movements north toward the Soviet border and by air, <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON> said Sunday that the final stage of the Soviet withdrawal has not yet begun. He remained cautious today: `` Just say the withdrawal is continuing.'' Western diplomats, who believe the Soviets want to cover up he withdrawal for security and diplomatic reasons, say the final stage of the two-stage withdrawal started at the beginning of January. Under a U.N.-mandated agreement, 50,000 Soviet troops left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by last Aug. 15 and the rest _ another 50,000 _ are due to be gone by Feb. 15. Soviet troops intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in Dec. 1979 to prop up the pro-Marxist government.

<HEAD>Settlers Raid Arab Village To Avenge Stoning Injury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dozens of Jewish settlers went on a rampage in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village and smashed windows of Arab houses after their bus was stoned and a passenger was struck in the eye by flying glass, news reports said today. Residents of the village of <LOCATION> Bidya </LOCATION> said the settlers from Ariel, 18 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, left behind handwritten leaflets in Arabic calling on Palestinians to stop the violence `` before it's too late. `` We will not sit quietly while you commit terror acts against us,'' the leaflet said. `` We are calling on you and stretching out our hand for peace, for the sake of our children and yours.'' Palestinians have routinely attacked <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilian cars with rocks and firebombs during their 13-month uprising. At least 368 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed since the revolt against Israeli occupation began on Dec. 8, 1987. Also today, a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> court convicted four <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> journalists of membership in the banned <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, headed by Palestinian radical <PERSON> Nayef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yakov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Efrat </PERSON>, <PERSON> Asaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Adiv </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Shwartz </PERSON> of the Marxist Derech Hanitzotz newspaper were sentenced to prison terms of up to 30 months. Authorities closed the paper last year. The four struck a plea bargain, confessing to membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for the court's dropping the more serious charges of contacts with foreign agents. In other developments, the army said it demolished or sealed the rooms of three suspected <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists from the Jabaliya refugee camp in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The army demolished the room of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khader </PERSON>, allegedly a member of a `` popular committee'' responsible for organizing anti-Israeli protests. <PERSON> Khader </PERSON> was suspected of attacking fellow Arabs seen as cooperating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Two other rooms, belonging to suspects in firebomb attacks, were sealed, military officials said. The measure is a frequent punishment used by the army. The army also sentenced a 30-year-old reserve soldier to 18 days in military jail for refusing to serve in the occupied lands. Sgt. <PERSON> Arnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronen </PERSON> was the 54th soldier sentenced to a jail term for such refusal since the uprising began, although an estimated 500 troops have requested and received transfers out of the territories without facing disciplinary action. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio and the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said about 100 settlers raided <LOCATION> Bidya </LOCATION> late Tuesday after a 16-year-old girl from Ariel was hit in the eye by broken glass when a passenger bus was stoned. <PERSON> Yediot </PERSON> said the settlers arrived in 50 cars, parked them on the main village road leading to <LOCATION> Bidya </LOCATION> and jammed traffic, then marched into the village carrying <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flags. Arab villagers hid inside their homes and the settlers smashed windows of houses until soldiers came and stopped them, <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> said. A military spokeswoman said she was checking the reports. An Arab reporter who spoke to <LOCATION> Bidya </LOCATION> residents said the settlers distributed a leaflet calling on villagers to stop the violence. `` We used to live together and we respected each other,'' the leaflet said. `` We are sorry to say the relations fell apart in recent months, when individuals on your side started stoning cars and throwing firebombs at our women and children.'' About 70,000 settlers, who live in the occupied lands amid 1.7 million Arabs, have frequently blamed the army for being too soft on the Palestinians and not putting an end to the rebellion.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s sending of representatives to Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral does not mean it has `` forgotten or forgiven'' the atrocities <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> committed during World War II, Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. The decision to send <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> and himself to the Feb. 24 funeral was made because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> now is `` an important, democratic member of the free world,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. His comments were contained in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> that was released today. They are the government's most detailed response yet to widespread public criticism over British representation at the funeral of a man many veterans still consider a war criminal. `` I am aware of the very strong feeling which has been expressed and I can assure you that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s representation at the funeral certainly does not mean that we have forgotten or forgiven the atrocities committed during the Second World War,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> wrote. `` Nothing can obliterate what happened then. Nor shall we ever forget the great debt we owe to those who fought and died in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and the terrible sufferings of so many in Japanese prison camps. The same is true of our Allies, many of whom are being represented at the funeral by heads of state or government.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is among world leaders who plan to attend the funeral. About 27,000 British prisoners of war died at the hands of the Japanese during World War II, many of them in the forced construction of the notorious <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> railway. A British war veterans' group said today it appreciated <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>'s remarks but still was dismayed that such a senior member of the royal family was attending the funeral <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION>, said he feared that `` with all these high dignitaries going, the Japanese will assume they are being exonerated for all the dreadful things they did in the war.'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said the Allies decided at the end of the war in 1945 that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> should not be held responsible either for the war itself or for atrocities committed during the war. They found no evidence linking him personally with political decisions taken by the Japanese empire during that time, he said. `` Indeed, the one decision that the emperor clearly had taken himself was in August 1945, when the war cabinet was split on whether to continue the war,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. `` The government then, for the first time, turned to the emperor, who decided that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should surrender and that he should personally broadcast the news to the nation.'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said the queen decided her husband, the Duke of <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, should represent her at the funeral after receiving advice from the government. `` It -LRB- her decision -RRB- was taken in light of the fact that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> today is an important, democratic member of the free world and an important partner of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, who will represent Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> said today that `` misguided ministerial advice to the duke will insult many ex-servicemen precisely because they can not forgive or forget.''

 Serial killer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> exchanged several letters with a religious broadcaster and anti-pornography crusader before they met for a videotaped interview hours before <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s execution, an associate said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, whose half-hour `` Focus on the Family'' program is heard daily on 1,200 radio stations, was the only member of the news media to interview Bundy in the days leading up to the Tuesday morning execution. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> canceled a press conference with 30 journalists on Monday. During the interview, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> coolly traced his origins as a serial killer, describing how boyhood glimpses of violent pornography became `` an addiction'' that grew until his `` destructive energy'' exploded from fantasy into reality. `` There are loose in the towns and their communities people like me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in, day out, by violence in the media ... particularly sexual violence,'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> was an outspoken member of former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s federal Commission on Pornography and was a leader of the nationwide protest last summer against <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>' `` The Last Temptation of Christ.'' <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> first received a letter from <LOCATION> Bundy </LOCATION> in 1987, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hetrick </PERSON>, a vice president of the California-based Focus on the Family ministry. The broadcaster then answered three or four more letters from Bundy, said <PERSON> Hetrick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> requested the interview with <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> through <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, a newly elected state prosecutor in <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> who previously counseled <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> through a religious ministry at the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> State Prison near <LOCATION> Starke </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hetrick </PERSON> would not reveal the content of the letters exchanged between <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, who met for a two-hour private interview Sunday. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> is scheduled to address the National Religious Broadcasters annual convention in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Saturday.

<TEXT>
 Hustler magazine's sexually explicit caricatures lampooning an anti-pornography activist are protected by the Constitution and can not be considered libelous, federal appeals court ruled. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday unanimously rejected a libel suit filed against the magazine by the activist, <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON>. The court said <PERSON> Hustler </PERSON> was merely expressing an opinion. <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON>, a feminist writer, was the author of an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> ordinance, which since has been declared unconstitutional, that defined pornography as a violation of women's civil rights and allowed women to bring civil lawsuits. Like other critics of pornography, she was lampooned in Hustler. A March 1984 issue included photographs of women engaged in lesbian sex, or masturbation, and included scenes of violence and fake blood; a caption on one picture referred to the `` <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON> Fan Club.'' A December 1984 cartoon showed a fat woman having oral sex and identified the woman as <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON>'s mother. `` <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON> errs by limiting ` opinion' to high-minded discourse,'' the court said, adding that `` outrageous and outlandish statements are sometimes protected.'' `` Ludicrous statements are much less insidious and debilitating than falsities that bear the ring of truth,'' the court said. `` Speech may not be suppressed simply because it is offensive.'' <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON>'s $ 150 million lawsuit was transferred from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> at the magazine's request and dismissed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashima </PERSON>. It was that ruling the appeals court upheld.

<TEXT>
 The alleged leader of an all-white <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla cell gave a clenched-fist salute today as he and two colleagues made their first court appearance. The three, charged with terrorism, attempted murder and other offenses, were arrested May 8, 1988 at a farmhouse near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> where, according to police, they had amassed the largest guerrilla arms cache ever found in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The alleged leader of the group is <PERSON> Damian </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, 31, a former newspaper reporter for the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION>. He raised his fist and shouted `` Amandla'' _ the <LOCATION> Zulu </LOCATION> word for power _ as he entered <ORGANIZATION> Pretoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrate </ORGANIZATION>'s Court. Appearing with him were <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, 37, a South African who allegedly received guerrilla training in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Donelly </PERSON>, 24, a British subject who allegedly was the unit's communications specialist The three were not asked to plead during the five-minute hearing, and a request for bail was denied pending another court appearance Feb. 7. A fourth person arrested at the farmhouse in <LOCATION> Broederstroom </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugg </PERSON>, did not appear in court Wednesday. Defense attorneys said they expected <PERSON> Lugg </PERSON> would appear as a state witness during the trial. The courthouse was heavily guarded, inside and outside, by police armed with shotguns. Supporters and relatives of the suspects, including Ms. <PERSON> Donelly </PERSON>'s parents, filled the gallery, and the British, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and West German embassies sent observers. A SAM-7 surface-to-air missile was among the weapons found at the farmhouse, according to police officials who said it was to be used in an attack on a police helicopter. The suspects also have been linked by police to a bomb blast in March 1988 which injured soldiers on a military bus. Police headquarters said a bomb exploded today at an electrical sub-station in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, causing minor damage and no injuries. The type of explosive device was not identified immediately, but police said a mini-limpet mine _ commonly used by <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas _ was found in a manhole near the blast site. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has conducted a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 aimed at pressuring the government into ending white-minority domination in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The organization is predominantly black, but several whites have been convicted over the years for participating in its guerrilla campaign.

 A parolee convicted of killing a police officer and mutilating a college student was moved from his home for fear a list of his crimes sent anonymously to neighbors might spark violence, officials said. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, 36, was moved from his <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> apartment on Tuesday. He had lived there less than a week. <PERSON> George </PERSON> was paroled Jan. 18 after nearly three years in prison for carrying a knife. He previously served nine years for killing a police officer, assaulting two others and attacking a 19-year-old student with a machete in 1974. This week, copies of a Police Department internal memo listing <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s crimes were mailed anonymously to neighbors. `` We moved him because ... I was afraid there might be some sort of demonstration,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> DiMaggio </PERSON>, regional administrator of the Parole Division of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> is a dangerous person, and we did n't want him to ` go off' if a confrontation occurred. The location of his new home was not disclosed. The memo detailed <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s criminal history, calling him a mentally ill man who `` believes his mission in life is to kill police officers and women.'' An anonymous note accompanying the memo said he is `` a time bomb waiting to go off.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> takes medication for a psychiatric condition. `` Somehow the memo got passed around the community, and it snowballed from there,'' <PERSON> DiMaggio </PERSON> said.

 Ailing <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> wants to open talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Filipino authorities on racketeering charges, which may be a first step toward a plea-bargain to allow him to return home, officials said. Justice Secretary <PERSON> Sedfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that he received a telephone call from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON>, who has been gathering evidence against the deposed president. <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> said <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> told him that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> wanted to open talks on the October racketeering indictment, in which he and his wife <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> are accused of embezzling more than $ 100 million during his 20-year rule. <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> refused to spell out details of what <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> wanted to discuss other than to say it was limited to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal racketeering charge. `` All that was impressed upon me was that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> ... is determined to discuss with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> authorities and the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government,'' <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife have lived in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since he was ousted in the 1986 military-civilian revolt that propelled <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> said the government wanted to make sure that any intermediaries were authorized to speak for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his family. `` My reply is we must first be sure that these persons are duly authorized to speak,'' he said. `` Their plan is to have a spokesman for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> and spokesman for the children,'' he added. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyers contacted him to relay an undisclosed message to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> refused to disclose the contents and refused to describe the message as plea-bargaining. The Philippine consul-general in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, said he was unaware of the messages from <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> added: `` If they're really going through <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON>, it sounds more like a plea-bargain with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, and if that's the case, it's a very delayed response. Presidential Executive Secretary <PERSON> Catalino </PERSON> <PERSON> Macaraig </PERSON> recently said the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government can no longer decide whether <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> can return home because <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is under criminal indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Philippine government claims <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates embezzled up to $ 10 billion before his ouster. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has repeatedly refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return from exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, citing national security. She has also said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> must return all the money he allegedly stole before there could any discussions on conditions for his return. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was hospitalized Jan. 15 in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> suffering from pneumonia and bronchial asthma. He was hospitalized twice last month for treatment of congestive heart failure.

<TEXT>
 Officials said today the death toll from an earthquake and mudslide in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> was only about a quarter of the 1,000 originally estimated, and they called off efforts to find more survivors. `` We will transform the settlement of <LOCATION> Sharora </LOCATION> into a common grave with a monument to commemorate the victims of this catastrophe,'' said <PERSON> Khusain </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasymov </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in the <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION> republic's stricken Gissar region. He said there was no hope of finding more survivors in <LOCATION> Sharora </LOCATION>, where 52 homes were buried and 100 bodies were hauled from the mud and debris. The republic's prime minister, <PERSON> Izzatullo </PERSON> <PERSON> Khayoyev </PERSON>, said 274 people were known to have died in Monday's pre-dawn quake, which toppled all 88 mud-brick dwellings in Okuli-Bolo and sent mudslides as high as 50 feet onto the villages of <LOCATION> Sharora </LOCATION> and Okuli-Poyen. `` There may be a difference of five or seven people in the casualties, but no more,'' <PERSON> Khayoyev </PERSON> said in an interview on a grassy hill overlooking <LOCATION> Okuli-Bolo </LOCATION>, 20 miles southwest of the capital, <LOCATION> Dushanbe </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency earlier made a preliminary estimate that up to 1,000 people died in the quake and mudslide. Officials on the scene did not explain the discrepancy in figures. A day of mourning was declared in <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. All flags were at half-staff, plays and concerts were canceled and restaurants were closed. `` The bitter truth is that nobody can be rescued from under a landslide provoked by the earthquake,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. But there were stories of miraculous survival. <PERSON> Kholmurod </PERSON> <PERSON> Barotov </PERSON>, 17, of <PERSON> Sharora </PERSON> said his 6-day-old cousin survived the quake held above the torrent of mud by her father, who perished. One man, 27-year-old <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Muratov </PERSON>, was found alive buried in the mud, the prime minister said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Muratov </PERSON> was in grave condition at a <LOCATION> Dushanbe </LOCATION> hospital. The agency said <PERSON> Sharora </PERSON>, the largest of the stricken villages, would be rebuilt near its former site and that construction would begin in several days. The 40-second tremor, which measured 5.4 on the Richter scale, hit before dawn Monday, loosening layers of mud that cascaded onto the rural villages. Last month, a quake registering 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale killed about 25,000 people in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Workers using shovels and bulldozers dug for survivors Tuesday, but local officials said today the efforts were in vain. <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhukov </PERSON>, who works at the republic's official news agency and is chief of a press information center set up in the wake of the tragedy, said no survivors were found Tuesday. <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION> officials said there would be no attempt to dig out the bodies of victims, unlike the efforts that lasted for weeks after the Armenian quake. `` Moslem law, the Shariah, says that people buried alive must be left there,'' <PERSON> Khayoyev </PERSON> said. Most of <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION>'s 4.8 million people are Moslem. He said relatives of those killed in <LOCATION> Sharora </LOCATION> voted Tuesday to fence off the settlement and transform it into a common graveyard. But other officials said two families had objected, and when foreign journalists visited the site today, residents and police were digging with shovels in at least two places. <PERSON> Zhukov </PERSON> said the republic would need about 400 prefabricated houses for survivors in the stricken villages. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> sent a planeload of relief supplies to the region and that the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> announced it would send a rescue team to <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION>. A special bank account was set up in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to accept contributions to aid victims. The Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda on Tuesday said much of the mud was carried to the villages by an earthen canal saturated by melting snow in the <LOCATION> Babatag </LOCATION> hills overlooking the buried towns. When the quake hit, it `` moved in a huge mass onto the villages,'' Pravda said. `` There is a danger of new mudslides in similar places in the event of a new natural blow.''

 Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s administration is postponing until the mid-1990s the sale of more than $ 4 billion in bonds because the state ca n't afford the principal and interest, an aide says. The bonds would have provided financing for school construction, earthquake safety, the homeless, safe drinking water and juvenile halls. The decision to delay the bond sales helped <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> balance his $ 47.8 billion 1989-90 budget proposal while rebuilding the emergency reserve to $ 1.1 billion, said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stancell </PERSON>, his assistant finance director. The postponement permits a delay in budgeting tens of millions of dollars for repayment, which must begin almost as soon as bonds are sold. Failure to budget repayment could raise `` big questions'' on Wall Street that could weaken the state's credit rating, <PERSON> Stancell </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think it would be prudent -LRB- to sell bonds -RRB- without showing how we are going to pay for them,'' he said. <PERSON> Stancell </PERSON> said the administration could change its decision if revenues improve enough.

 Two Shiite Moslem militias battled with mortars and machine guns in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> today several hours after negotiators for both sides reached a cease-fire accord in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Police said at least five fighters were injured in the one-hour battle between the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, and the pro-Syrian Amal militia in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Apple province. A police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the fighting broke out between <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> positions in the villages of <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouswar </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> fighters in the hamlets of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Filla </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jarjou </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION> is the key to a triangular-shaped enclave controlled by about 500 <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters on the western edge of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed `` security zone'' in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Earlier in the day, the <ORGANIZATION> Syrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> saying the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> factions had agreed to an immediate cease-fire following three days of mediation by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It said the militias would continue negotiations aimed at reaching a `` comprehensive reconciliation agreement to regulate the relationship between Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and deal with the reasons for tension for the sake of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s unity and its liberation from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation.'' The factions have been fighting on and off for nine months in a struggle for control of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1 million Shiites, the country's largest sect More than 500 people have been killed and 1,500 wounded in a series of battles that began in April. Several earlier cease-fires collapsed under the deep-rooted hostility between the rival militias. The Israelis and their militia allies control a `` security zone'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintains north of its border with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The zone was created in 1985 as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attacks. The Shiite battles have strained the strategic alliance between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s main Arab ally during its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, and both sides have sought to quell the fighting. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> seeks to create an Iranian-style Islamic republic in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The more secular and nationalist <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> seeks a multisect government in which Moslems would share power equally with the once dominant Christians. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> advocates guerrilla attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in a Moslem campaign to liberate <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> seeks only to drive the Israelis out of the border strip and wants to curb <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s raids because they provoke Israeli retaliation.

 Leftist guerrillas are likely to be politically strengthened by their startling offer to take part in elections, whether the proposal prospers or dies on the vine. Even government officials grudgingly admit the insurgents will probably be bolstered by the surprise proposal made Tuesday. One high-ranking Cabinet official likened the guerrillas' offer to a bomb and complimented the rebels on devising such a powerful weapon. `` It is very ably constructed. You have to take it apart very carefully and examine all the component parts in trying to deactivate it,'' he said of the rebels' radical policy shift. The Cabinet official spoke on condition of anonymity because the government has not formally responded to the rebel proposal. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also has not responded. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, the incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' presidential candidate in this year's election, said Tuesday that the rebels' main condition for participating in the vote could not be met The guerrillas said elections set for March 19 should be postponed until September, but the Constitution prohibits such a postponement. The proposal from the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> can be taken at face value _ or it can be examined for possible ulterior motives. A nine-year-old civil war has devastated this Massachusetts-sized nation, killing 65,000 of its people, making refugees of a million and ruining the economy. The guerrillas, who have called previous elections this decade `` farce'' and part of a counterinsurgency plan, may simply want to end the war. `` The country is headed for a social explosion. We feel a responsbility to explore possible alternatives. We are being responsible and flexible,'' <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Guadalupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a member of the guerrilla <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference Tuesday in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` Flexibility is a sign of strength,'' said <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Samayoa </PERSON>, a member of the guerrillas' political-diplomatic committee. The rebel document's authors said their offer was partially motivated by `` an international situation in which the majority of wars are being resolved by means of negotiation.'' Negotiations have recently produced agreements to seek an end conflicts in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, among other countries. The Contra insurgency in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has also been quieted by a preliminary cease-fire agreement. A rebel source in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> said: `` There is a wave of negotiations in the world. We want to look for a solution that is not so drastic -LRB- as war -RRB- so the country's fall wo n't be so drastic.'' The guerrillas do n't just want to end the war _ they presumably want to win it. Their proposal, especially if rejected, could improve their standing. Reporters who recently spent time with guerrillas in the hills of <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION> provinces, both rebel strongholds, heard leaders talk of preparations for a big push in coming weeks. The insurgents launched two nationwide offensives late last year. During the past three months they have hit four major military installations in the capital, bringing a predominantly rural war to the city. The guerrillas appear heady, and sources close to them confirmed that attacks will increase if the proposal gets nowhere. If the rebels do step up their attacks, they likely will point to rejection of their election overture as a spurning that left them no alternative but to escalate warfare against an intransigent regime. Most military observers say the 7,000 rebels have little chance of defeating the 56,000-man army. The rebels say they are organizing rural and urban sympathizers and that the moment for mass insurrection is not far off. The rebel proposal appeared to have been directed as much at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> politicians as the guerrillas' countrymen. Copies of the proposal were circulating in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sunday, 24 hours before being leaked to the press in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The two administrations of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave more than $ 3 billion in aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> with the stated object of fostering democracy. The country has had a civilian president, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, since 1984, but leftists claim his administration is a facade for continued military power. `` We hear they -LRB- in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration -RRB- are more practical and less ideological,'' <PERSON> Samayoa </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> news conference. `` We hope for a departure from the policy of the administration of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, which blocked peace efforts in Central America.'' The rebels enjoy significant support from so-called `` solidarity'' groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that have proven effective lobbyists in the past. However their proposal is received, the rebels will not lose their current supporters. If it is rejected, they could use alleged government inflexibility as a recruitment tool. If it is accepted with modifications, they and their political allies could increase their base through campaigning. `` The document was drafted with great skill,'' said the government official. `` If they shot as well as they write, they would have routed us by now.''

 A man whose girlfriend had broken up with him fatally shot one of her friends at the mushroom farm where he worked, then killed himself outside a school as police closed in, authorities said. The gunman, <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Segura </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, also seriously wounded two co-workers Tuesday at the farm 80 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. His former girlfriend, <PERSON> Francisca </PERSON> <PERSON> Partido </PERSON>, was not at work when <PERSON> Segura </PERSON>, wearing sunglasses and carrying a semiautomatic rifle, walked into a packing shed. The 50 workers inside scattered when <PERSON> Segura </PERSON> asked for one woman by name, shot her, then sprayed the inside of the building with gunfire, said <PERSON> Francisca </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriella </PERSON> <PERSON> Geisler </PERSON>, a lab technician who was working in the shed. `` Everybody was going crazy. I saw them screaming and trying to hide,'' she said. A 26-year-old woman was killed in the first burst of gunfire, said sheriff's investigator <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Reneau </PERSON>. Her identity was not immediately released. <PERSON> Geisler </PERSON> said the woman had tried to help <PERSON> Segura </PERSON>'s former girlfriend since the couple split up three months ago. The wounded workers were listed in stable condition today at <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Community </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Segura </PERSON>, who was carrying three clips of ammunition, fired about 12 shots, then fled in a sports car and stopped several miles away near <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> High School, with a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol vehicle behind him, authorities said. He shot himself in the head before backup officers arrived moments later, authorities said. <PERSON> Reneau </PERSON> said <PERSON> Segura </PERSON> revved his engine to full acceleration, muffling the shot. The school had been alerted to the shootings and chase, and <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carocci </PERSON> ordered students to remain in their classrooms. He said he closed the gate to the school as <PERSON> Segura </PERSON> drove up. <PERSON> Segura </PERSON>'s arrival at the school prompted fear of an incident similar to the slayings last week of five youngsters in a Stockton schoolyard. The high school received about 60 calls immediately after the incident from concerned parents, <PERSON> Carocci </PERSON> said.

 The editor of a liberal Afrikaans-language newspaper pleaded innocent today to a charge of violating security laws by quoting a banned leader of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Preez </PERSON>, editor of Free Weekly, said the article in question did not directly quote <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Slovo </PERSON>, leader of the South African <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the only white member of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s national executive committee. Instead, du <PERSON> Preez </PERSON> said, the Nov. 11 article conveyed the views of the writer, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Swilling </PERSON>, a political scientist who joined other <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> at a conference in October in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> attended by Soviet officials and <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders, including <PERSON> Slovo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Slovo </PERSON> and virtually all other <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders can not be quoted legally in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The organization, which operates from offices abroad, has conducted a bombing and sabotage campaign aimed at undermining white-minority rule. Free Weekly, established last year, is the only anti-apartheid newspaper aimed specifically as Afrikaners, the mainly Dutch-descended whites who control the government. At the hearing today in <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, du <PERSON> Preez </PERSON> pleaded guilty to charges that four issues of Free Weekly were published before it was registered with <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. The hearing will resume Feb. 13. In <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, journalists and political activists held meetings to protest the government's continuing crackdown on opposition newspapers and magazines. Four anti-apartheid publications, all with circulations of less than 20,000, have been warned by Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> that they face temporary closure for allegedly publishing subversive material. The editor of one of the threatened publications, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> of Work in Progress, said the government ensured that its propaganda was publicized but prevented its opponents from speaking out. Another of the threatened publications is Al-Qalam, a monthly newspaper produced by the <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Its staff issued a statement saying in part: `` The limits to what we publish will be determined not by the apartheid state, but by our divinely guided principles of truth and justice.''

 Pressure to get an agreement on a federal budget is very strong, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader said today, because nobody wants to see an across-the-board cut in federal programs. `` We have a target pretty much of a budget resolution by about the 15th of April,'' Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, said on the `` CBS This Morning'' television program `` Nine months from now we run into the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings -LRB- deficit-reduction -RRB- deadlines. That means you're going to have an across-the-board cut in both defense and domestic accounts, unless they're exempt accounts, which will take care of the budget deficit targets if we do n't have a budget plan that's agreed on between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the administration,'' he said. `` That sort of pressure to get an agreement is very strong, because no one wants to see ... an across-the-board cut,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met Tuesday with <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and other congressional leaders to set the stage for this year's budget work. He plans to speak about his administration's priorities in an address to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 9 and then detail his budget proposals soon thereafter. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> minority leader, said he hoped the time frame would be telescoped to considerably less than nine months. `` We'd like to do as we did last year, get our appropriations bills out on time. That means that the budget resolution and its allocations ought to be done just as quickly and speedily as possible,'' he said. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he wants to see the specifics of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget before making any decision on a budget summit. `` We have n't decided on a precise formula or process yet but we are listening to the president's suggestions and we are promising to get back to him after we hear the specifics of his budget,'' he said. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, made a point Tuesday of emphasizing there would be consultations, not negotiations. `` We'd like to wait and until we see a budget, until we see where the areas of agreement and disagreement would be, before we consult,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> presented <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a jar of pork rinds and some hot pepper sauce, one of the president's favorite snacks. `` There is -LRB- a -RRB- good atmosphere,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader. The president's choice for budget director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, suggested weekly meetings between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and selected leaders from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in order to expedite the budget process. But while lawmakers said they'd be glad to meet, and would work to keep the process running on time, none was ready to put a new team of negotiators above the committees already charged with working out spending plans. `` The president's team will be welcomed, as soon as they want to come, by our budget committees,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` It would be to our advantage to have the leadership meet in an informal sort of way from time to time, moving the process along,'' said <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>. He did not support bypassing the current process, he said. Although there is precedent for a budget `` summit'' _ one occurred in late 1987 after the stock market crisis _ it is unpopular on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> because it cuts most lawmakers out of the process. In addition, cautious congressional leaders do not want to be wedded in any way to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget proposals until they are made public. Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the president needed first to send up his budget and then begin discussions without setting up a new framework While a `` summit'' can serve a function, it also carries the risk of leaving the rest of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> behind _ and alienating the votes needed to enact the results, he said. `` You could cut a deal at a high level only to find out that members are n't going to be with you when it comes to a vote,'' he said. `` A worse thing than failing to get an agreement is getting an agreement that fails.''

A security source in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the shells were fired during what `` appeared to be a major operation'' by the Israelis inside the security zone. He said he had no details of the reported operation but noted the Israelis fired about 500 flares that illuminated the security zone during the night. Several artillery and mortar rounds were fired in the region, which overlaps the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force's operations zone, the source reported. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> set up the 6-to-10-mile deep security zone when it withdrew the bulk of its army from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985.

A police spokesman, who can not be named under standing rules, said they were rounded up during the night and included 25 children between the ages of one and 12. They were driven in SLA trucks to a crossing on the northern edge of the security zone, where they walked into the Syrian-controlled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. On Jan. 5, 30 Lebanese were deported from the zone after being charged with `` disrupting security'' there. <PERSON> Wahlgren </PERSON> visited <PERSON> Shibaa </PERSON> following today's expulsion and said, `` I express my deep concern over the incident.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> jetliner aborted a takeoff today from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> airport, and 16 people were injured during the emergency evacuation, officials said. The Airbus 300-600 with 252 people aboard was taking off for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> when the pilot noticed a fire warning indicator and aborted the flight, said airline Vice President <PERSON> Chusak </PERSON> <PERSON> Baachaiyud </PERSON>. As the aircraft stopped, a smoke warning indicator came on and the pilot ordered an emergency evacuation, <PERSON> Chusak </PERSON> said at a news conference. He said passengers were injured as they left the aircraft on eight slides from emergency exits. Except for one Thai national, all passengers aboard Flight 640 were Japanese, an airline spokesman said on condition of anonymity. The injured, all Japanese, were released from a local hospital after treatment and were to fly back to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> late today, <PERSON> Chusak </PERSON> said. He said an investigation showed that a rupture in a high pressure pneumatic duct caused the aircraft's left engine to overheat. The smoke warning followed because the sudden and rapid stop generated excessive heat in the braking system, <PERSON> Chusak </PERSON> said. Thai Airways International is the country's flag carrier and flies to destinations in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Government leaders today advised President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> to accept opposition demands for a referendum on whether voters support him, officials said. At a meeting, leaders of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> voters should have the chance to assess his performance, said party officials. They said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> called the meeting to deal with opposition allegations he was trying to avoid the referendum. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> and other opposition party leaders agreed to push for the referendum. Before he was elected in December 1987, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> promised he would hold such a referendum after taking office, but he set no date. Government party leaders lack broad public support but have said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is confident of victory. Some opposition leaders contend <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> would have to resign if he lost a referendum. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has only said he would `` accept responsibility'' if defeated. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has introduced broad reforms since he took office in February. But the opposition accuses him of being reluctant to take firm action to deal with past government abuses. Opposition leaders have demanded the government punish officials involved in corruption and other abuses under the authoritarian government of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> went into rural exile in November after making a public apology for misdeeds under his administration, and <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has asked the nation to pardon him. In a related development today, prosecutors questioned three <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> loyalists, including the former government security head, <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Se-dong </PERSON>, on charges of abusing power under the old government. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> played a key role in helping <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> seize power in a coup in 1980.

 <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was optimistic when jurors asked for clarification of murder laws, indicating they might be torn over his guilt or innocence in the death of his illegally adopted daughter, an attorney said. `` For the first time during deliberations, he is feeling more optimistic,'' defense attorney Ira <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said Tuesday. The jury returned today for a third day of deliberations. Jurors on Tuesday asked state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> if they could infer that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> fatally beat 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> based on testimony that he beat his former live-in companion, <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> told jurors they could not, repeating what he told them during his instructions. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> then moved for a mistrial, which was denied. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a disbarred attorney, is charged with murdering <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, whom he obtained at birth from an unwed teen-ager but never legally adopted. The child was removed comatose from <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment in 1987 and died at a hospital three days later of a brain injury. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death in an affluent, well-educated househould attracted wide attention and raised questions about the duty and ability of neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and report evidence of child abuse. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, a former children's book editor, testified as the prosecution's star witness that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> told her in bed, after they used cocaine and while <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> lay comatose on their bathroom floor, that he had `` knocked <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> down and she did n't want to get up.'' The prosecution maintains that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, whose murder charges were dropped in return for her testimony, was too physically and emotionally disabled by 12 years of living with <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> to have harmed <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s lawyers charge that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> fatally beat the child in a jealous rage. Later Tuesday, the jury asked <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> if it could move on to the lesser homicide counts against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> if it was not unanimous on the murder charge. <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> reiterated that jurors could consider manslaughter only if they were unanimous in acquitting him of murder. The jury received the case Monday after 12 weeks of trial and 52 witnesses.

<HEAD>Meat Group Opposes Overhaul of Inspection System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A national meat trade association is urging the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to withdraw a proposal for overhauling federal inspection at meat and poultry processing plants. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> made the proposal last November to carry out a 1986 law that would get tougher on inspections of the most troublesome processing plants but ease up on those with good records. Over time, officials estimated the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> inspection force at the affected plants would be reduced by half by retirements and resignations. The program would rely increasingly on `` good'' plants policing themselves. Department officials said the proposed rule changes would strengthen inspection in the 6,300 plants that process meat and poultry by focusing on those that need it most. But the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, in comments filed with <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> last week, said the plan has serious problems and should be withdrawn and then developed more carefully. The group said the proposal is `` overly complex, cumbersome and burdensome to the regulated industry.'' <PERSON> Manly </PERSON> <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON>, institute president, said the industry organization `` has supported and continues to support the fundamental thrust of the changes envisoned in the law'' but that there is `` clearly a need to rethink'' the proposal. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> period for public comments on the proposal runs through Feb. 2. <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON> said the industry does n't go along with `` the notion that a rule should be finalized hastily in the face of so many unanswered and unresolved questions.'' As proposed, the new rule would apply to plants that make frankfurters, beef stew, chicken soup, luncheon meats and scores of other processed items that include meat and poultry. The proposed rule would not apply to slaughter plants, which would remain under continuous federal inspection.

<TEXT>
 A former diplomat testified that he was told the person behind the 1976 assassination of dissident <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Letelier </PERSON> is a former government official sought by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the case. Former envoy <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barros </PERSON>, in testimony before a local judge, said the mastermind was identified to him as Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> <PERSON> Sepulveda </PERSON>, former head of the nation's secret police. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for years has been seeking the extradition of <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> and his top aid, Col. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON>, on charges of ordering the assassination of Letelier and an American aide, <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffitt </PERSON>. The two were killed Sept. 21, 1976, when a remote-control bomb blew up their car in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> D.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> was one of seven former officials questioned last week at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Local newspapers carried the testimony in today's editions, and <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> confirmed the accounts in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> told Judge <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Banados </PERSON> that air force Gen. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Montero </PERSON> told him during a meeting in the late 1970s that `` this genius of intelligence mounted an operation to assassinate Letelier.'' <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> said <PERSON> Montero </PERSON>, who was then undersecretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, told him he was referring to <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>. At the time of the killing, <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> was chief of a feared secret police agency, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> said that according to his information, military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was not aware of the assassination plot. <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> testified he was told by another participant in the meeting, former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON>, that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was not aware of the alleged plot. <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> `` asked Contreras three times privately and two more times in front of witnesses whether he had something to do with the Letelier case, and <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said no,'' <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> later ordered administrative sanctions against <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> `` for lying to the president,'' <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Letelier </PERSON> was a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador for the leftist government toppled by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in a bloody 1973 coup. He was among <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s most influential critics abroad. The Chilean <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extradition request in 1979, saying there was insufficient evidence that <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> and <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> were involved in the assassination. An American who worked for <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>' agency, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Townley </PERSON>, confessed in a plea-bargain in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to planting the bomb on the order of superiors. Army Maj. <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Larios </PERSON> fled <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> in 1987 and surrendered to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. He confessed to being an accomplice to the killing and implicated <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> and <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON>, both now retired. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has accused <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> of not cooperating in the case and earlier this month invoked a 1914 bilateral treaty that calls for international arbitration of disputes that can not be resolved by other means. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Errazuriz </PERSON> Tuesday criticized the move. `` We energetically reject the implicit pressure in an affair that we are handling seriously and professionally,'' he said. The government had not decided how to respond to the move, he said. Under the terms of the 1914 treaty, the dispute would be handed over to a commission associated with the international court of <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Gratz </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and one of the most powerful politicians in the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, resigned today over a scandal surrounding the mysterious sinking of ship 12 years ago. <PERSON> Gratz </PERSON>, 59, is the second senior Socialist official to step down because of his alleged involvement in the so-called `` Lucona'' scandal, the subject of a widely publicized investigation by a parliamentary committee. Interior Minister <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Blecha </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Gratz </PERSON> a onetime protege of former Chancellor <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreisky </PERSON>, resigned Jan. 19 <PERSON> Blecha </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gratz </PERSON> have denied wrongdoing or aiding <PERSON> Udo </PERSON> <PERSON> Proksch </PERSON>, the prime suspect in the sinking of the ship Lucona in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Six sailors died. The Lucona's cargo was officially described by <PERSON> Proksch </PERSON> as for a uranium processing plant and insured for $ 16 million. The insurance company has never paid, claiming the cargo was only scrap metal and alleging the vessel was intentionally sunk to collect the insurance money. <PERSON> Proksch </PERSON>, wanted by Austrian justice on suspicion of murder and insurance fraud, has been variously described to be living in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In several interviews, <PERSON> Gratz </PERSON> described himself as a close friend of <PERSON> Proksch </PERSON>, but when <PERSON> Proksch </PERSON> fled to escape prosecution, <PERSON> Gratz </PERSON> criticized him. <PERSON> Gratz </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> today he would give up his seat in February, hence his post as president, one of the most prestigious posts in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` My decision is a personal one and it is politically motivated,'' <PERSON> Gratz </PERSON> told the house. `` If it becomes impossible for the president to effectively take a stand on significant issues or to speak up on problems of parliamentarism because everybody is only interested in his context in a single other topic, then he can not serve the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- parliament -RRB- in such a way as is his duty.'' In past newspaper stories, <PERSON> Gratz </PERSON> was accused of providing fabricated evidence from abroad to help <PERSON> Proksch </PERSON> in his claim that the controversial shipment was for a uranium processing plant. <PERSON> Gratz </PERSON>, who denied the allegations, was also accused of helping <PERSON> Proksch </PERSON> in several other ways.

<TEXT>
 Cambodian Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> today rejected the idea of an international peacekeeping force in his country, saying `` <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> can help itself'' as Vietnamese forces withdraw. Also today, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agency said <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> guerrillas had demanded <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> produce a timetable for its pullout from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted the guerrillas<ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kampuchea </ORGANIZATION> as saying <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s withdrawal should take place according to a publicized timetable with international supervision. The guerrillas' main international sponsor, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, has made similar demands. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has promised to withdraw all its troops by September 1989, but it has not given a timetable to show how the withdrawal will proceed. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said Vietnamese and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials reached some agreements during talks last week, but it did not say if those included an agreement on a timetable. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> made his comments before meeting with Thai leaders, including Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> and army chief Gen. <PERSON> Chavalit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongchaiyudh </PERSON>. A Thai government spokesman, <PERSON> Suvit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yodmani </PERSON>, said the talks were a `` frank discussion'' but stressed they did not constitute Thai recognition of the pro-Hanoi government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> `` just wants to get to know <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> because <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> later on most likely will be involved in a coalition government, hopefully when there is peace'' in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Suvit </PERSON> told reporters. He said both sides agreed that warring Cambodian factions all must attend peace talks on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> next month in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has shunned the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government since its creation 10 years ago following the Vietnamese invasion of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. It has backed a three-party guerrilla coalition fighting Vietnamese and <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The international peacekeeping force was part of a peace proposal by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, leader of the guerrilla coalition. `` I think Kampuchea -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> -RRB- does not need an international peacekeeping force because <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> can help itself, but other countries must help end all military aid to -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leader -RRB- Pol Pot'' and to the resistance, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> told reporters. He said <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s proposal would lead to the return to power of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians during its 1975-78 rule. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is one of the parties in the guerrilla coalition. Stepped up initiatives on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> have come as Vietnamese forces withdraw from the country, raising fears the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> could regain power. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 to drive the pro-Chinese <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from power, claims it now has about 50,000 troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and has set September 1989 as a target date for pulling out all its forces. This month in <LOCATION> Beijiing </LOCATION>, Chinese and Vietnamese leaders began talks on the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict in the first face-to-face meeting of high-level officials from the two countries in more than nine years. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> also said today he was ready to discuss with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the issue of Americans missing in action in the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war and said the discussions could take place in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which lists 83 Americans as MIA in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, does not recognize the <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> government. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has enjoyed cooperation from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> in the effort to resolve the fates of Americans missing in the war, but there have been no known official contacts on the issue with <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>.

 Hours before his execution, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> coolly traced his origins as a serial killer, describing how boyhood glimpses of violent pornography became `` an addiction'' that grew until fantasy exploded into reality. The 42-year-old law school dropout, whose bizarre mixture of intelligence, charm and homicidal bloodlust was the subject of five books and a TV movie, also warned before his execution Tuesday that there were others like himself. `` There are loose in the towns and their communities people like me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in, day out, by violence in the media ... particularly sexual violence,'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said in a videotaped interview Monday. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, who after a decade of denial confessed to murdering at least 23 young women since the mid-1970s, said he deserved his punishment. His execution in the electric chair at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> elicited cheers from more than 100 people who stood in a field across from the penitentiary. `` I do n't want to die, I'm not going to kid you. ... -LRB- but -RRB- I deserve, certainly, the most extreme punishment society has. I think society deserves to be protected from me and from others like me,'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said in the interview with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, a religious broadcaster and psychologist. He said between sobs he hoped the interview would spur society to protect itself from the widespread influence of pornography, TV violence, X-rated movies. Although he said he felt remorse for the sex-related murders, which authorities believes could total 50 or more nationwide, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said, `` There is no way in the world that killing me is going to restore those beautiful children to their parents.'' Detectives in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> have said in the past week that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> has confessed to 23 killings there but that he did not provide names for all of the victims. But an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent gave a higher number in a story published today. The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagmeier </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s confessions closed the books on 13 killings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>; provided information that may never be confirmed on 14 more cases in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and touched on at least 20 more slayings in various states dating back to 1969. Added to the three <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> killings of which <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was convicted, this would put the number of victims to <LOCATION> Bundy </LOCATION> to at least 50, all girls or young women. <PERSON> Hagmeier </PERSON>, a specialist on serial killers who interviewed Bundy last weekend, could not immediately be reached for comment today. He checked out of his Starke motel this morning to return to his <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> headquarters. But <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> confirmed today that <PERSON> Hagmeier </PERSON> had given him those rough figures. Including the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> killings, <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said, `` there were 30, based on <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s statements, that he appeared to be clearly linked ... and perhaps up to another 20 where he was a suspect or a probable, I think, is the terminology he used.'' `` I do n't know that it's far off from the figures everybody has bandied about anyway,'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said today. `` Those are the figures I've heard for many years. I do n't think we'll ever know exactly how many.'' Handcuffed and sitting at a table across from <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> alternately sobbed and smiled during the 29-minute interview. He was dressed in the peach-colored, short-sleeved shirt worn by Death Row inmates. He appeared to ponder each question carefully, sometimes pausing at length before answering articulately. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, who has a daily radio program heard on 1,200 radio stations, asked about the rape and murder of 12-year-old <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, for which <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was executed. `` What did you feel after that?'' <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> held his hands to his face, closed his eyes and thought for a long time before responding: `` I ca n't talk about that right now. ... It's too painful. ... I ca n't begin to understand the pain that the parents of these children -LRB- felt -RRB-. `` I do n't ask them to forgive me. I'm not asking for it. That kind of forgiveness is of God.'' Prodded by <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> to explore the sources of his violence, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said that during his murder rampages `` the unique thing about how this worked ... is I still felt in my regular life the full range of guilt and remorse about other things.'' But the murders, he said, were `` compartmentalized'' in his brain, a `` very well focused, very sharply focused area that was a black hole that was like a crack and everything that fell into that crack hole just disappeared.'' He emphasized he did n't blame pornography for his actions and took full responsibility. But he said hard-core pornography, fueled by alcohol, `` guided and shaped'' what he did. `` I have lived in prison for a long time now, and I've met a lot of men who were motivated to violence just like me. And without exception, every one of them was deeply involved in pornography,'' he said. Claiming he was `` essentially a normal person'' who grew up in a good home, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said: `` People need to recognize ... those of us who are or who have been so much influenced by violence in the media, in particular pornographic violence, are not some kind of inherent monsters. We are your sons and we are your husbands and we grew up in regular families. And pornography can reach out and snatch a kid out of any house today.'' But Dr. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Otnow </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a psychiatrist who examined <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> as part of a last-ditch attempt to save him from execution, said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s first home was that of his maternal grandparents, with a grandfather who was `` an extremely violent and frightening individual.'' The grandfather would kick dogs, swing cats by their tails, beat people who angered him and read pornography voraciously, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, psychiatrist said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said a cousin told her that when <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was a preschooler in the home in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, he used to sneak into a greenhouse where his grandfather's pornography was kept and read it. In the interview, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said his desire to murder `` happened in stages, gradually. ... Once you become addicted to -LRB- pornography -RRB-, and I look at this as a kind of addiction like other kinds of addiction, I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. `` You keep craving something that is harder, harder, something which, which gives you a greater sense of excitement. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes so far, you reach that jumping-off point where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing it would give you that which is beyond just reading it or looking at it. `` In the beginning it fuels this kind of thought process, then at a certain time, it is instrumental, I would say crystallizing, making into something which is almost like a separate entity inside. ... a building up of this destructive energy.'' After committing his first murder, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said, he was `` absolutely horrified that I was capable of doing something like that.'' `` It was like coming out of some horrible trance,'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said. `` It was like being possessed by something so awful, so alien. `` But then the impulse to do it again would come back even stronger.'' <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Williams-Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funeral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION>, said he accepted custody of the body, but no funeral was planned. He would not give any details on arrangements, including whether there would be burial or cremation.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, before leaving office, suggested the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration consider easing trade controls on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> if it meets the Feb. 15 deadline for withdrawing all troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said today. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who stepped down last week to be succeeded by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, made the suggestion in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who also resigned with the advent of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, in a reply letter to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, did not commit himself to a position to be passed on to his designated successor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, and suggested the trade issue be handled without a recommendation by the new administration, the official said. `` The allies are interested in easing the sanctions, but I do not know if it's a top agenda item for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> moved its troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to support a Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> against U.S.-armed rebels. In 1980, in a punitive gesture, the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration imposed a ban on trade in sensitive equipment with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Even if the restrictions were removed there still would be barriers to providing American military technology or equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who supported U.S.-Soviet reconciliation, did not insist on lifting the sanctions but simply suggested such a step be considered if the Feb. 15 deadline was met, the official said. At the same time, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has favored continuing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms support to the Afghan rebels if the Soviets kept arming the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s position on the sanctions was `` this is something that should be discussed,'' the official said. `` But there are always people in the government who will tell you that sanctions should not be taken off.''

<HEAD>Democrats Kick Off Legislative Push For Voluntary National Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressional Democrats kicked off a major legislative push today for a program of voluntary national service that would link federal education, job training and housing benefits to civilian or military service. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the prime sponsor of the legislation in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said the program is `` very much in line'' with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call in his inaugural address for more civic responsibility and less emphaiss on selfish interest <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he hopes the national service proposal will `` awaken a new spirit of citizenship and civic obligation in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' by energizing young people to attack the nation's social needs while earning education or housing benefits. `` This is not a guaranteed benefit,'' he said. `` This is a guaranteed opportunity to earn a benefit.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said in a statement that the introduction of the legislative proposal `` moves the topic of national service to the front'' for consideration by the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Under the program, which would be phased in over five years beginning in 1990, young volunteers in the `` Citizens Corps'' would get a $ 10,000 voucher for each year of civilian service, or a $ 12,000 voucher for each year of military service. The civilian volunteers would be paid subsistence wages of $ 100 per week plus health insurance during their period of service. The vouchers could be used to finance a college education, to pay for vocational or job training or as a downpayment on a new home. After the five-year phase in period, the vouchers would replace most federal student loans and grants, although such aid still would be available for those not qualified for the national service program. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moskos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor who developed much of the legislative proposal, said the program eventually could cost the federal government $ 5 billion a year, based on an estimated 500,000 to 600,000 civilian volunteers and 400,000 military recruits. But <PERSON> Moskos </PERSON> said much of that cost would be offset by the elimination of federal student loans and grants and by the reduction in federal costs for meeting many of the social needs, such as providing nursing home care to the elderly, that would be handled by the young volunteers. The legislation, which was introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by Rep. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., specifies that administration of the program would be handled primarily on the local and state level

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the son of the former president, has admitted he left a profanity-laced, threatening message on the answering machine of a photographer suing him over the publication of two pictures. Photographer <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> has filed a complaint against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> over the Jan. 15 phone call. Police Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said he spoke with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday and was preparing a report for the district attorney's office for possible prosecution. <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> said a caller identifying himself as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` You can quote me,'' then launched into a tirade that threatened physical harm against <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> and ended with the words, `` I hope your ... family dies in a plane crash with you in it.'' The call was made after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> received a subpoena from <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> for a small claims action in which the photographer is seeking $ 1,500 for copyright infringement over the use of two pictures in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1988 book, `` On The Outside Looking In.'' <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> said the pictures were not authorized and uncredited. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a statement Tuesday, `` I regret that he was uncredited,'' but contended that <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> has been continually raising his prices for the photos. `` I lost my cool, which I should not have done, and I apologize for that,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` But I actually apologize more to my friends and my family for this kind of behavior which is caused by the pressures placed on me because of my position.'' <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> said he would n't drop the police complaint. `` He seems to act erratically and it seems that he has a violent temper,'' said <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON>. Under <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law, it is a misdemeanor to call another individual with intent to annoy and use obscene language or threaten to inflict injury. The maximum punishment is six months in jail and a $ 1,000 fine.

Sometimes it's in a restaurant; sometimes its on the freeway. On -LRB- Jan. 17 -RRB-, it happened to take place at a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> elementary school during recess. ...

We urge each and every one of you to call and-or write our lawmakers and demand that they put an end to this senseless violence. Insist, at the very least, on a seven-day waiting period before guns are sold. Demand tough screening procedures. Require a ban of such killing machines as the AK-47 and other weapons that serve no purpose other than to slaughter people. Like it or not, the blood of those five innocent children is on our hands, too.

 Jan. 21 <ORGANIZATION> Kennebec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidency: The phrase `` kinder, gentler,'' endlessly repeated as it has already been, is now functioning as a key expectation of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. ... Part of -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s program could cause him trouble. He wants a kinder nation without more spending on domestic programs, and, of course, `` no new taxes.'' Rather, like -LRB- <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, though a bit more plausibly, he lauds the `` thousand points of light,'' the volunteer groups fighting poverty, homelessness and hunger. The trouble is, charity has never fulfilled the role <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and now <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, have assigned it. `` Relief,'' as it was called during the Great Depression, gave people a free meal but did not cure the lack of schooling and jobs which produced often hopeless conditions of poverty. Only a full scale commitment by government to, yes, the welfare state, can ever truly be expected to cure poverty. ... Social Security is the most successful anti-poverty program ever devised. Before it began, nearly 7 in 10 older Americans lived in poverty. Now fewer than 1 in 10 do. But such solutions are n't cheap: Social Security pays out $ 200 billion in retirement benefits every year. ... Do n't expect any such radical move in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first year. But if he takes his own advice seriously, eventually he will have to change his mind, and his policies.

The 3-0 ruling Tuesday by the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> was a partial victory for environmentalists, whose suit had been dismissed by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. But the appeals court also lifted its ban on logging of so-called `` old-growth'' timber _ timber from virgin or long-established stands _ near spotted owl sites, at least until the lawsuit is decided. That section of the ruling prompted timber industry lawyer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutzick </PERSON> also to claim victory. There are 289 spotted owl sites within the timber sale area on the western slope of the Cascades, said attorney <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. The suit contends logging of old-growth timber would eliminate the birds by destroying their habitat. The spotted owl, which lives in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, is not an endangered species under federal law, although <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is under court order to reassess the bird's status by May 1. Environmental groups regard the spotted owl as an `` indicator'' species, whose reduction in a given region is a signal that other forms of life are threatened. While removing the ban it imposed last June on new logging of old-growth fir within 2.1 miles of a spotted owl site, the court said environmental groups could ask a federal judge to forbid sales from specific sites as they are proposed. The timber industry blamed the court's previous order for the loss of 1,000 lumber and plywood mill jobs, but <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> disputed that. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> had ruled previously that a 1987 law prohibited the environmentalists from suing. That finding was largely reversed by the appeals court.

 Machinists' Union members fanned out across <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on Wednesday to lobby for repeal of a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> rule change that would allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to handle more aircraft maintenance at foreign repair stations. About 250 union members sought congressional support for legislation introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON>, D-Calif., that would repeal the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rules change On Nov. 22, 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> revised <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION> 145 to eliminate a rule that limited foreign repair to work on aircraft which are used in operations conducted completely or in part outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Under the change, aircraft flown on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic routes can also be repaired at foreign work stations. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterpaul </PERSON>, transportation vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the two main issues were jobs and safety `` You're talking about a potential here for thousands, tens of thousands of jobs to be lost,'' <PERSON> Peterpaul </PERSON> said. About 90,000 of the union's 600,000 members work in the aviation industry. <PERSON> Peterpaul </PERSON> said the safety issue has become `` very, very distressing'' in view of recent incidents involving aging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airliners, including sudden in-flight disintegration of aircraft fuselages and loss of engines. `` An airplane does n't make any money on the ground _ it's always got to be up in the sky,'' he said. `` This competitiveness that's been created as a result of deregulation I think is one of the main culprits involved _ why some of these carriers have gotten so lax in some of their maintenance. <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON> said that `` prior to the rule change, the ability of airlines to get their domestic aircraft serviced abroad was quite limited.'' With the change, however, `` <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> domestic aircraft will now be able to be maintained overseas ... on a free and open basis, without prior approval,'' he said. `` Let's not mince words,'' <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON> told a union gathering. `` You know that this is bad policy, I know that this is bad policy. And those new rules should be repealed.''

 A moderate earthquake shook the gold fields of the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> today and was followed by avalanches at one mine that killed two miners and injured four, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest mining company, said it did not know if the avalanches were caused by the quake, which measured 4.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale.

 Art collectors, dignitaries and those who surrounded <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> during his last reclusive years today attended funeral services for the artist, who was buried under the museum where his first exhibition was held. Several thousand onlookers applauded as four pallbearers in red, blue and gold outfits designed by the artist carried his coffin from a church to the Theater-Museum. It was placed in a marble tomb in the floor. The museum is a former municipal theater where the surrealist artist first showed his paintings to the public in 1918. The tomb dug Sunday, the day before <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> died, is below <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s floor-to-ceiling work, `` Lincoln in <LOCATION> Dali </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vision </LOCATION>,'' a giant nude painting of his late wife, <PERSON> Gala </PERSON>, that turns into a portrait of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> when seen from across a courtyard Earlier, a Catalan-language funeral service was held for <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> in the nearby 14th century <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where he was baptized 84 years ago. `` Salvador, now that you have found the beauty with which you have tried to surround yourself, we wish you a perfect rest and peace,'' said parish priest <PERSON> Narciso </PERSON> <PERSON> Costabella </PERSON>. Spanish Culture Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Semprun </PERSON>, Catalan regional government president <PERSON> Jordi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pujol </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s cousin <PERSON> Montserrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenech </PERSON> and close friends of the painter joined townspeople in the small church. <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> Figueras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> of heart failure brought on by respiratory problems and pneumonia. He left an estate estimated at $ 87.7 million. The estate's exact value is difficult to calculate because of the erratic prices of 20th century art and the widespread existence of forgeries. <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s will reportedly divides his estate among the governments of <PERSON> Figueras </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Catalonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Under Spanish law, it can not be read until at least 15 days after his death. A major question is whether private collectors own the lucrative reproduction rights for their <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> works. `` I'm here because of a 45-year-old friendship, to pay my respects to a dear friend and that's all,'' said <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>, owner of the largest private <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> collection outside <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in his <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, museum. The American collector told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he did not want to discuss possible legal battles until after the mourning period was over. Also in town for the funeral was <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Descharnes </PERSON>, a French photographer who had been close to <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> since the early 1980s and was the principal merchant for his works. The Spanish press has implied that <PERSON> Descharnes </PERSON>, the author of what is considered the most complete catalogue of <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s works, kept the painter in seclusion and controlled everything around him. <PERSON> Decharnes </PERSON> has called the accusations `` absolutely wrong.'' He administers the Dutch-based company <ORGANIZATION> Demart </ORGANIZATION>, which owns reproduction rights to <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s works until 2004. Italian collector <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Alboretto </PERSON>, who owns more than 500 <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> works, said today he had prepared legal action against <PERSON> Decharnes </PERSON>, who he said had prevented him from visiting the painter. Figueras Mayor <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorca </PERSON> said he did not know whether <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s only living close relative, his sister <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>, figured in the will The <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vanguardia </ORGANIZATION> reported that the sister planned a private funeral service in her home in nearby <LOCATION> Cadaques </LOCATION>. A founder of the surrealist movement in the early 1930s, <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> was the last of an outstanding generation of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> painters that included <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miro </PERSON>. A fervent Catalan, he returned to his native region in 1948 after living in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities. In later years he was known as much for his outrageous personality and theatrical interviews as for his paintings. <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> went into seclusion and sank into depression when his wife, manager and muse, <PERSON> Gala </PERSON>, died in 1982. He had a history of heart problems and had been confined to a wheelchair and fed through tubes since he was badly burned in a 1984 fire.

 A sheriff brought 69 inmates to the Capitol today in a protest against jail overcrowding, but the prisoners were sent back on orders from Gov. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> without even getting out of their buses. `` It was totally irresponsible on the part of the sheriff and was reckless endangerment of the public,'' said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>. The two busloads of <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> inmates arrived as part of a protest by <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> sheriffs, who blame jail overcrowding on the state's practice of forcing local jails to accept state inmates until prison space opens up. The buses pulled up to a curb outside the Capitol but left about 15 minutes later. <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> said that he never intended to take the prisoners into the Capitol, that the inmates were nonviolent and that he had informed police and Capitol security guards in advance. `` This is not a sideshow, this is business,'' he said. <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> said the demonstration was in support of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill that would let counties decide whether to accept overflow state prisoners. Currently, counties are paid $ 15 a day per prisoner, which <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> said is about half the actual cost. `` We are a holding facility, not a prison,'' said <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>. Asked where the state should put the 4,000-plus prisoners it has in county jails, <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> said, `` That's not my problem. Where am I going to put them?'' Corrections Commissioner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> has asked for 7,100 new prison beds in the fiscal year beginning July 1 to ease overcrowding, but <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> included no money in his $ 7 billion budget proposal for new prison space. <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriffs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said half of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s jails are overcrowded with state prisoners at a cost of $ 27 million a year to local taxpayers. `` We've got a very desperate situation,'' he said. Earlier this week, overcrowded jails in <LOCATION> Colquitt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turner </LOCATION> counties were the scenes of minor uprisings, and overcrowding was a factor in recent disturbances at prisons in <LOCATION> Milledgeville </LOCATION> and at the <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail. `` These things are going to continue to pop up as long as we've got too many prisoners,'' <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> said

<HEAD>Renegade Unit Reportedly Ignores IRA Order To Disband</HEAD>
<UNK>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with slaying today. No pickup.</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Irish <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is engulfed in a serious internal dispute because its most ruthless unit apparently has refused to obey the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> leadership's order to disband, a newspaper reported today. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> quoted unidentified <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters as saying the order stemmed from a dispute over the unit's killing of <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> civilians. The unit will likely continue operating as a renegade group, the newspaper said. Also today, a 26-year-old construction worker was slain in the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> by two gunmen, and police said they were investigating whether it was another incident of sectarian violence. On Tuesday, another <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper, The Independent, quoted unidentified <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> sources as saying the guerrilla organization had ordered the unit in question disbanded and disarmed because of the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> slayings. The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the province with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> socialist </ORGANIZATION> rule. The controversial unit reportedly is based just across the border from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> around the towns of <LOCATION> Ballyshannon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bundoran </LOCATION>. The Times said the unit had coordinated the bombing of an annual memorial service for World War dead at <LOCATION> Enniskillen </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fermanagh </LOCATION> on Nov. 8, 1987. The attack, which killed 11 civilians, provoked worldwide condemnation of the guerrillas. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> admitted it made a grave error and apologized. The Independent reported that one of the killings that angered <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> leaders was that of <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON>, a 23-year-old Protestant from <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fermanagh </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Two gunmen killed <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> Jan. 15 as he visited his Roman Catholic girlfriend at <LOCATION> Ballintra </LOCATION> in the republic, 10 miles across the border. <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> was a former reservist with the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> police force, but left the force three years ago. Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> condemned the slaying as `` brutal and senseless.'' The Independent said another Protestant civilian victim of the unit was a 21-year-old Fermanagh woman, <PERSON> Gillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, who was slain in March. The unit said at the time that its target had been her brother, who the group claimed was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>, a locally recruited <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> unit in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The family and police denied the brother was a member of the force, and a later <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> statement said the killing had been a mistake. The Times said the unit is believed to have seven members, including a prosperous Irish businesswoman who acted as its intelligence officer. It said the unit has strong links to the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a breakaway Marxist rival of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper quoted <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters as saying the unit might switch allegiance to the rival. In today's slaying, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic news service, identified the victim as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Ballynahinch </LOCATION>, 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. The news service said <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> was a Protestant and that police thought the shooting may have been a case of mistaken identity. He was operating excavating equipment in a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> neighborhood in <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> when the gunmen stepped from behind bushes and opened fire, police said.

 People living near a volcano in northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that came to life last month for the first time in 26 years are bracing themselves for another powerful eruption. Scientists studying the volcano said Wednesday there were signs another major eruption was developing. `` Based on the volume of magma that exists there may be a major, powerful eruption to match'' those that occurred in 1926 and 1962, said <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujii </PERSON>, professor on volcanology and petrology at <ORGANIZATION> Hokkaido </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fujii </PERSON> based his prediction on analysis of rock samples taken from nearby peaks following the Dec. 19 eruption of the 6,814-foot <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tokachi </LOCATION> in central Hokkaido, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s northernmost main island. <PERSON> Koichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueda </PERSON>, an official of Kamifurano-cho, a town of 14,000 people just 15 miles from <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tokachi </LOCATION>, said 13 town officials were maintaining an around-the-clock watch.

 An unusual emergency operation was performed this week on <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>'s beachfront, with the director of a natural history museum performing surgery on a 220-pound giant sea turtle.

<HEAD>Lobbying Heating Up Over Soon-To-Expire Steel Import Curbs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The new session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> signals the beginning of a lobbying war over whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should extend soon-to-expire steel import curbs that have helped the American steel industry become profitable. The current import ceilings, which were negotiated in the fall of 1984, expire Sept. 30. Already there has been `` a lot of rhetoric'' on whether they should be renewed, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinsch </PERSON>, steel trade expert for Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., said this week `` In terms of parties coming and sitting down, it's just now beginning to heat up,'' <PERSON> Reinsch </PERSON> said. Pressured by the steel industry and by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration negotiated five-year steel trade agreements with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and other leading steel-exporting nations. The idea was to give American companies breathing space from subsidized foreign competitors by pressuring the competitors to restrict imports on a product-by-product basis. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and other large steel companies have begun pushing for an extension of the curbs beyond 1989. But with the steel industry turning a second consecutive profit last year and with some importers complaining of steel product shortages, it is no sure bet that the large firms will win renewal of as strong a package of quotas as in 1984. Three days before winning the November election, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged to continue the so-called Voluntary Restraint Agreements in some form. But opponents of the plan believe they can make a case for ending or at least scaling down the import curbs. There is little argument that the curbs have aided the steel industry's revival. Imports have been reduced from 26.4 percent of the American market in 1984, to about 20.5 percent last year. Meanwhile, employment and profits were up last year over 1987. The issue is whether the quota agreements are still necessary, and to what degree, if at all, they have harmed other sectors of the American economy besides steel companies. The <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metalforming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group, says the availability of steel has been reduced because of the import curbs. The association represents hundreds of metal product manufacturers that convert such products as brake pedals and computer frames from raw steel. `` Our position is because of the restrictions on steel supplies _ which cause increases in prices and limited availability _ we would rather see the most open and competitive steel market possibile,'' spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Estell </PERSON> said Monday. The steel trade issue has already spawned some angry language. After <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, issued a September 1988 paper arguing against continued import ceilings, the American Iron and <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> soon compiled a 20-page, point-by-point rebuttal. In the Jan. 1 rebuttal, the trade association accused Caterpillar of `` numerous distortions and inaccuracies.'' The paper claimed that the import curbs `` do not cause steel price increases or otherwise impede the competitiveness of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. manufacturers.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint-Laurent </PERSON> brought back big shoulders and plunging necklines Wednesday for his haute couture collection of spring and summer clothes, displaying his flair for elegance and the female form. Whether for day or evening wear, the broadened shoulders are set off by deep decolletes and big round buttons. Hemlines stop above the knee and pants abound, ending above the ankle. Even when skirts and dresses showed slits soaring high over the thigh, the collection spelled class from start to finish. <PERSON> Saint-Laurent </PERSON>'s 90 creations, modeled to the breathy singing of <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, got a warm reception from a packed house that included French actresses <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Deneuve </PERSON>, a Saint-Laurent regular, and <PERSON> Arielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Dombasle </PERSON>, along with ready-to-wear queen <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rykiel </PERSON>. While other high fashion houses earlier showed the soft and rounded feminine lines of the 1930s, <PERSON> Saint-Laurent </PERSON>'s day wear flattered the form with his signature structured look. Suit jackets were shorter than in previous years, their spartan style softened by oversized cufflinks and big round buttons. Underneath were daring blouses in the sheerest of mousseline. <PERSON> Saint-Laurent </PERSON>'s classic pants, both casual and formal, were the ultimate in wearability, featuring the generous front and back darts that hide the imperfections of most mortals. The most beautiful designs were the simplest, letting the body speak for itself. One breathtaking dress appearing in several different versions for day and night was a simple wrap that tied on the hip. Others had big brassy buttons running up the bust, down the buttocks and over the hips. Pert pillbox hats and large round earrings polished the look. Evening wear was a study in colorful bougainvillea floral patterns in crepes and chiffons, worn long in draped dresses or over-the-shoulder, floor-length capes. <PERSON> Saint-Laurent </PERSON>'s tuxedos were as striking as ever, mixing navy and black and worn with see-through chiffon blouses. Another successful design was an updated version of the sailor middy shirt, presented in soft navy wools and crisp white linen. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> also presented his collection Wednesday, and there was something for everyone who likes to wear dresses. The colors exploded on the runway, with bright reds, sunny yellows and juicy oranges melting into pastel pinks, blues and gentle greens. Like <PERSON> Saint-Laurent </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> displayed big shoulders and spiced up the simplest designs with sexy decolletes in front and back. Once the preserve of beachwear, the bustier is everywhere. <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> makes them in pink and yellow leather for daytime and in silk and lace for evening. Except for a few cruise-line outfits with wide, flowing sailor pants draped gorgeously at the waist, <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> was all dresses, long and short. In daytime wear, hemlines modestly skimmed the knee. There were big-shouldered safari suits in orange shantung, light wool coat dresses in Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> plaid and short leather suits with bolero jackets. <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> excelled in cocktail and evening wear, using drapery to highlight hourglass waistlines and curvy hips. The lines were pure and feminine, with lots of cut-out backs set off by elaborate embroidery, ruffles and bows. Some cocktail dresses had such big bustles, sitting down would be next to impossible. Others featured asymmetrical hemlines, rising to midthigh in the front, brushing the floor in the back _ the design also used in the collection's `` piece de resistance,'' the wedding dress.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> faced serious questions about scaling back <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending and about his personal ties to defense contractors as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> prepared to open hearings today on his nomination to run the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The committee met in executive session this morning, said <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mass </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the committee. Details of the meeting were not available. The former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator could expect to be treated with special courtesy by his former colleagues this afternoon in the historic <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Caucus Room, site of the Watergate and Iran-Contra hearings. But the 63-year-old Tower, who emerged as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee after an exhaustive background check, was certain to be quizzed on his consulting work for defense contractors and his private life, as well as on defense policy and overall Pentagon funding Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday he expects the hearings to be marked by some controversy based on the reports that have already been raised in the media `` There's enough out there,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. Confirmation hearings are under way for two other <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appointees: _ Commerce Secretary-designate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> was warmly received Tuesday before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Lawmakers told the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman he should make the government a more aggressive advocate for American businesses in the world marketplace. His nomination is expected to win easy approval from the committee next week. _ Today marked the start of hearings on <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s appointment as transportation In written responses to questions from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the 50-year-old <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> transportation administrator said foreign airlines serving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be forced to meet the same security requirements as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. The Tower hearings are likely to focus in part on the issue of overall military spending. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked in his final budget for $ 315.2 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. The request represents a 2 percent increase after inflation. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, according to testimony last week from <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, is expected to reduce <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request by an unspecified amount. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fails to trim the request, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is likely to do so. In the past four years, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has cut military spending increases to levels below the rate of inflation. `` I think they're whistling Dixie if they think they'll get a 2 to 3 percent increase in spending,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` They'll be fortunate if they get the inflation factor. Tower, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also was certain to be quizzed about his connections to a number of defense contractors. According to public records and associates, Tower's consulting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> has been on annual retainer with <ORGANIZATION> Martin-Marietta </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and British Aerospace. Tower's firm also received about $ 100,000 a year under a contract for consulting services to <ORGANIZATION> Hicks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, Va.-based aerospace consulting firm headed by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, a former undersecretary of defense. A lengthy <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check of Tower pushed his personal life into the forefront, including his bitter divorce and reports of drinking and womanizing. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in announcing the appointment of Tower, dismissed `` a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless,'' and said, `` I am totally satisfied in that regard.'' Sens. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, ranking members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said they would read the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> reports on all nominees before the hearings Expected to raise the question of Tower's private life is <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>, chairman of Coalitions for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a conservative think tank. <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> is scheduled to testify before the committee next Tuesday. In an interview last week, <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> said he opposes the Tower nomination because the former senator fails to meet the ethical standards <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> envisioned for his administration.

 A veteran <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> diplomat secretly defected to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> three months ago after becoming disillusioned with widespread official corruption and with <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> support for Marxist rebels in at least three Latin American countries. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguililla </PERSON> <PERSON> Saladrigas </PERSON>, 35, broke with the revolution last October when he was granted political asylum by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, but his defection was not publicly disclosed until the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> made him available for an interview Tuesday with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Aguililla </PERSON> criticized the corruption that he said Cuban officials engaged in while he was posted in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and added he was troubled by the lack of freedom and the `` total militarization'' of Cuban society. The Cuban diplomatic mission here was apprised of <PERSON> Aguililla </PERSON>'s allegations on Wednesday but spokesman <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pino </PERSON> refused comment President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has acknowledged that corruption in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is a problem but he nonetheless contends that the revolution has produced hundreds of thousands of selfless individuals who volunteer for social welfare projects at home and in numerous Third World countries. <PERSON> Aguililla </PERSON>, whose diplomatic career spanned 14 years, offered a rare glimpse into the role <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has played in cooperation with Palestinian radicals in the shadowy international arms trafficking business. <PERSON> Aguililla </PERSON> said that with <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> help, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has arranged for the transport of large quantities of Western-made weaponry to guerrilla groups in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and also provides training in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for leftist African groups. He said that between 1980 and 1983 while he served as the second ranking official at the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, he routinely made trips to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bekka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> where the trunk of his car was loaded with rifles, pistols, revolvers and smoke bombs. He said Palestinian groups, particularly two pro-Marxist factions, were the principal source of weaponry, which he was able to transport back to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> without a customs check because of the diplomatic plates on his car. On occasion, he said, a top <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> intelligence officer flew to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> for larger-scale arms transfers. Weapons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> or Italian manufacture were favored because `` socialist involvement'' in the arms trafficking scheme could thus be concealed, he said. `` The Palestinians were a good source of Western arms because they had a lot of contacts to get them,'' he added. `` The policy of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has always been to export the revolution,'' <PERSON> Aguililla </PERSON> said as he recounted his experiences in the 75-minute interview. Speaking in Spanish while chain-smoking cigarettes, <PERSON> Aguililla </PERSON> said he does not know if the arms smuggling operation by way of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> continued beyond 1983 because he left the country in early 1984. He said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> assists the Palestinian movement in a number of ways, including the provision of `` training of a terrorist nature.'' Palestinians, he said, are trained by Cubans as frogmen and in the use of `` all types of weaponry'' as well. Non-lethal skills also are taught, such as how to falsify passports and to engage in clandestine correspondence through an invisible writing technique. <PERSON> Aguililla </PERSON> was assigned last September to be the second ranking official at the Cuban Embassy in <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>. He departed <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> on October 10 but at a transit point en route, which he refused to disclose, he asked for political asylum for his wife and two children, aged 13 and 10. He described <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> as `` paranoid'' and `` capricious'' and said he was disturbed by widespread evidence of corruption in Cuban society, sometimes at high levels of government. <PERSON> Wilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Espin </PERSON>, a member of the Politburo and head of the Federation of Cuban Women, once helped herself during a visit to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> to a fund that embassy women had contributed to for parties and toys for children, he said, adding that she used the money for shopping. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Fundora </PERSON>, formerly the chief ideologue of the revolution, stopped once in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Aguililla </PERSON> said, and asked him to exchange money on the black market. `` He was supposed to be the model of socialist morality but nonethless he violated the law of that country,'' <PERSON> Aguililla </PERSON> added. The wife of a former <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Orosco </PERSON>, used to finance shopping expeditions by drawing thousands of dollars from an embassy fund and saying the money was being used for `` cleaning materials'' for the ambassador's residence, <PERSON> Aguililla </PERSON> said.

 Attorneys for fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> disclosed today they have issued subpoenas in the Iran-Contra case to three <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committees and two members of the House. North attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said the subpoenas were sent to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> committees. The two members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were n't identified. Defense subpoenas also were issued for two unidentified House staff members. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, through the general counsel to the clerk, subsequently moved to quash portions of the subpoenas to the committees. A 22-page court brief said the panels could not allow the `` wholesale rummaging through the records of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'' sought by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers North's subpoenas require `` surrender of the broadest imaginable range of privileged documents,'' including `` the whole set of records'' of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> intelligence panel's investigation of the resupply operation for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, the brief said. The committee began the investigation after the October 1986 shootdown of a Contra resupply plane in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> carrying American <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON> as one of its crew members. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said with regard to the two House members subpoenaed: `` We're not going to pull them off the floor. We're going to have to approach this part of the case with some degree of accommodation.'' North's trial is scheduled to get under way next Tuesday, although an interagency intelligence group is still reviewing classified documents that both the prosecution and defense want to use at trial. The brief references to subpoenas by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense team came at a court hearing where prosecutors argued in favor of subpoenaing <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s spiral notebooks, which he compiled on a daily basis while he was at the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he would decide by Friday whether <PERSON> North </PERSON> should be compelled to produce the notebooks, portions of which were turned over to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the Iran-Contra hearings in 1987. At the court hearing, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said the notebooks might be applied to the portion of the case alleging destruction of documents by North in November 1986 as the Iran-Contra affair was unfolding. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said prosecutors might try to link references in the notebooks to documents that <PERSON> North </PERSON> allegedly destroyed before leaving the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> declined to acknowledge that the notebooks existed or were in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s possession, but he said <PERSON> North </PERSON> is entitled to Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. The notebooks also delve into <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s assistance to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels and his involvement in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's secret arms shipments to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> North </PERSON> took the last of the notebooks with him when he was dismissed on Nov. 25, 1986 after the diversion of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sale proceeds to the Contras was uncovered. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has been trying to get the notebooks since well before <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s indictment last year. A subpoena for the material was issued through the federal grand jury investigating the Iran-Contra affair, but was withdrawn after <PERSON> North </PERSON> was charged, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in a court filing Monday. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the notes are `` presidential records over which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has complete ownership and control.'' The notebooks could be used by prosecutors in an attempt to bolster the portion of the government's case alleging that <PERSON> North </PERSON> made false statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by saying that the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> offered no tactical advice to the Contras and by denying that he used his influence to help move supplies to them. North's notebooks describe successful efforts to obtain false end-user certificates from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> stating that arms actually destined for the Contras were instead for the exclusive use of the Central American country to which they were being sent. The false certificates enabled one of North's co-defendants, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, to ship more than 90,000 pounds of East European munitions by chartered aircraft from a European arms dealer to the Contras. North's notebooks also touch on his participation in efforts to secure space at a Salvadoran air base to launch Contra resupply missions, and the construction of an emergency airstrip in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, to help open a southern front of Contra military operations. The notebooks also detail North's participation in arranging the November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. One charge against <PERSON> North </PERSON> is that he obstructed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by helping to prepare a false chronology that said no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official learned before January 1986 that Hawk missiles had been shipped to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in November 1985. In notebook entries for Nov. 20, 1985, several days before the Hawk missile shipment, <PERSON> North </PERSON> detailed a plan for shipping <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in exchange for a four-phase release of hostages.

The agency, quoting unnamed sources, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Feb. 25-26 following his trip to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` I just do n't know yet'' whether he'll go to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk, responding earlier to the Yugoslav report, said `` there are no plans at this time'' for such a trip. White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> declined to confirm or deny whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be making such a trip. `` I would suggest that you wait for the tall thin guy -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- to sing, or the short bald guy -LRB- press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> -RRB- to tell you that the tall, thin guy has sung,'' he told reporters. `` There is no official announcement of that yet.'' `` Nothing on the itinerary -LRB- of the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> trip -RRB- is ready for announcement yet,'' he said. There has been widespread speculation that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would use the occasion of the Japanese trip to visit both <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from the trip to the Orient. His first trip out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as president will be to <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> on Feb. 10, for talks with Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> trip will be the first outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the new president. The White House press office said Tuesday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> `` will discuss bilateral and international issues of common concern'' during the one-day <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> visit. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has not yet confirmed the report on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s impending visit, but its spokesman has recently said that the president `` would be welcome in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will hold talks with Chinese officials on bilateral and other issues, especially political developments in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after the two countries re-established diplomatic ties, `` is very popular in Chinese political circles.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was chief of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> liaison office in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1974-75.

<TEXT>
 A survey of scientific studies suggests most women suffer no lasting emotional trauma from abortion, but the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says much of the research is flawed and more studies are needed. `` By and large, what you find is that most of the women who have abortions experience a sense of relief,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, director of public interest legislation at the <ORGANIZATION> APA </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday in an interview. He said the <ORGANIZATION> APA </ORGANIZATION> survey showed that post-abortion syndrome, a notion that women are harmed emotionally by abortion, is not a scientifically or medically recognized disorder. However, <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gans </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION>, said negative findings on the effects of abortion are absent from the scientific literature because the <ORGANIZATION> APA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> have a pro-abortion bias. Thousands of women, she claimed, suffer emotional problems after undergoing abortion. Earlier this month, Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said in a letter to the White House that there was no scientifically sound evidence showing negative health effects to the 1.5 million women who get legal abortions annually. Both <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Gans </PERSON> agreed with the position taken by <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, and both said there is a need for scientifically valid research. <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> APA </ORGANIZATION> experts surveyed more than 100 research studies on the psychological effects of abortion and found that most of the research was flawed because there were few valid comparisons. For example, <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> said, there are no studies that directly compare the relative effects on women who chose abortion with those who decide to bear an unwanted child for adoption, or raise the child out of wedlock. In general, he said, however, the studies do not show any lasting psychological trauma that can be attributed solely to abortion. `` It's clear that the vast majority of women are not going to experience any significant problems,'' said <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>. `` Millions of women are having abortions and it appears to be a relatively benign procedure both medically and psychologically. It just depends on the circumstances surrounding the abortion.'' Miss <PERSON> Gans </PERSON> said many women suffer from `` post-abortion syndrome'' and experience great difficulty from having an abortion. `` Post-abortion syndrome is a theory that has been discussed by clinicians around the country among those who have seen patterns emerge,'' she said. Professionals are beginning to compile research on it `` but they are having difficulty getting published,'' said Miss <PERSON> Gans </PERSON>. She said the <ORGANIZATION> APA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> have a bias toward abortion and a hostility toward studies that show negative findings about abortion.

 In Motown, where cars are synonymous with life itself for many, psychologists say a recent skein of reported roadway shootings has shaken motorists' confidence in their cars as rolling security. Since November, there have been at least 10 random highway shootings in and around <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Some were roadside snipers, others stemmed from traffic disputes. `` You've got a lot of idiots out there with guns in their cars and you put that together with publicity and people start taking shots at each other,'' Assistant <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Halushka </PERSON> said. `` It certainly makes people anxious and it affects people's behavior on the road,'' said <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanay </PERSON>, a professor of psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> `` The car has been known as a sort of sanctuary but now, that's not the case.'' The most serious incident occurred Nov. 22, when <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, was shot and killed while sleeping in a car driven by his wife on Interstate 75 in <LOCATION> Southgate </LOCATION>. Police have made no arrests. Since then, there have been reports of shots shattering car windshields. State police investigators subsequently discovered the damage was caused by rocks. No serious injuries have been reported. It has happened before. In the summer of 1987, at least five people were killed and 20 injured in an unrelated string of shootings on <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> freeways. Some of the incidents stemmed from traffic disputes while others appeared to be random sniper attacks. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area authorities set up a highway violence hot line to handle calls from worried drivers and special aerial freeway patrols were established. The shootings later tapered off. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> authorities have no similar plans. State police are trying to be more alert but lack the manpower to increase road patrols, said Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>, commander of the state police freeway post in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tanay </PERSON> said the media have given the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> incidents _ real and imagined _ unwarranted attention, which has contributed to drivers' anxiety `` We live in a society where there's violence. Why is it so shocking that it happens in a car? People die in car crashes everyday,'' he said. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> also criticized the heavy news coverage of the shootings. `` It's my feeling that copy catting always occurs in things of this type,'' he said. `` I've tried to downplay things of this nature, though.'' Authorities say most people now are driving more cautiously to avoid traffic disputes. But the extent to which driving behavior is altered depends on the psychological makeup of the particular individual, said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Birkhill </PERSON> of Southfield-based <ORGANIZATION> Couseling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. `` It depends greatly on how much people use denial to protect themselves,'' <PERSON> Birkhill </PERSON> said. `` Many deal with traumatic events by denying them. Most people _ if it has n't happened to them _ they are able to dismiss the possibility of danger.'' Catching a highway shooter is difficult, <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said. `` In most instances, there are no witnesses and we have few leads to go on.'' Authorities hope the sentencing of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayes </PERSON>, 17, to eight to 20 years in prison for a highway shooting will be a deterrent. <PERSON> Rayes </PERSON> pleaded guilty Jan. 3 to the shooting of 19-year-old <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamsa </PERSON> on I-696 in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lamsa </PERSON> was wounded in the neck and was hospitalized for several days. <PERSON> Rayes </PERSON> told police he mistook <PERSON> Lamsa </PERSON> for someone he had argued with at a carnival earlier in the evening.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today credited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with `` definite improvement'' in human rights but said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will watch what develops in the months ahead while weighing whether to carry through with a promise to attend a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit on human rights in 1991. `` I think we need to look for performance, and there will be time in which to see performance in that regard,'' he said. He added `` there has been definite improvement in some ways there, but let's see what develops as we move towards that conference date. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not backing away from its commitment to attend the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> conference but said, `` There's plenty of room for independent analysis'' between now and 1991. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his comments in an interview with two reporters as part of a White House's experiment to make the president available to the news media in different forums. A transcript of the session was made public. The president hinted he may visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> next month after stopping in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for the Feb. 24 funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. `` Stay tuned,'' he said. `` We may have something on that ... yea or nea before the close of business today, but I just do n't know yet.''

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said Wednesday he wo n't be driven from office by a stock-trading scandal that has forced three Cabinet ministers to resign, and will try to restore public trust in government. Opposition leaders have demanded <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s removal since <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Harada </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> director, resigned Tuesday because of links to the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> conglomerate, the company involved. <PERSON> Harada </PERSON> was appointed a month ago in a Cabinet realignment intended to quiet complaints about the scandal, and had been chosen to lead an investigation of financial connections between Recruit and politicians. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> declared his new Cabinet free of taint from the scandal, in which politicians and others were offered advance shares in a Recruit subsidiary and made huge profits when the stock went public. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said in a television interview Wednesday the <PERSON> Harada </PERSON> resignation `` reinforces my feeling that we need to do something. We must make efforts to dispel public distrust in government and in the party.'' At a meeting with Japanese reporters, he said demands for his resignation were `` a matter for me to judge.'' News reports said <PERSON> Harada </PERSON> received monthly political donations of about $ 80 from Recruit for 14 years until the end of 1987, well after the stock-trading scandal was revealed. Recruit-Cosmos, the subsidiary, sold unlisted shares to more than 150 influential politicians, journalists and businessmen. Although the transactions were not illegal, the deal aroused suspicions of bribery and influence-peddling. The result was a public outcry over fund-raising practices and the traditional coziness between Japanese businessmen and politicians. <PERSON> Harada </PERSON>, 69, was chosen for the new Cabinet the prime minister appointed Dec. 27 in an attempt to restore the image of his government and his party, the conservative Liberal Democrats. He said Tuesday, in resigning, that Recruit had not sought favors from him and he had done nothing wrong. <PERSON> Koichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aino </PERSON>, also 69, was appointed to replace him. Justice Minister <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> resigned after only three days in office when it was disclosed that he continued receiving donations from Recruit after the stock deal was exposed. <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, the finance minister, quit in December after repeatedly changing his story about an aide's purchase of shares in his name. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told Japanese reporters Wednesday that opposition calls for him to resign were `` a matter for me to judge.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition group, adopted a resolution at its annual convention Wednesday demanding parliamentary elections. `` We're pretty sick of all this,'' <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, the party chairwoman, said in a television interview. Several ranking current and former bureaucrats also have been linked to Recruit. <PERSON> Kunio </PERSON> <PERSON> Takaishi </PERSON>, former deputy education minister, and <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, former deputy labor minister, bought shares in <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Takaishi </LOCATION> was forced to abandon his quest for a seat in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and prosecutors have questioned <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> several times. <PERSON> Yoshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Okai </PERSON>, the current deputy, and <PERSON> Masayuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomiyama </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged accepting dinners and golf trips from Recruit. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials both would quit at the end of the month, but described the resignations as routine and unrelated to the scandal. The ministry monitors and sets guidelines for the personnel and employment-information fields, Recruit's main business, and prosecutors are investigating the possibility of bribery. Since the scandal began last June, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has pledged to clean up government, most recently saying in his New Year's speech he would seek to revise election laws and rules for political donations. Asked Wednesday how he would erase public distrust, he said: `` I will solve -LRB- problems -RRB- one by one.'' The prime minister is scheduled to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next week to meet with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, son of the former president, has admitted he left a profanity-laced, threatening message on the answering machine of a photographer suing him over the publication of two pictures. Photographer <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> has filed a complaint against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> over the Jan. 15 phone call. Police Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said he spoke with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 43, on Tuesday and was preparing a report for the district attorney's office, which would decide whether to prosecute. <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> said a caller, identifying himself as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said, `` You can quote me,'' then launched into a tirade that threatened physical harm against <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> and ended with the words, `` I hope your ... family dies in a plane crash with you in it.'' The call was made after the younger <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the former president's adopted son with ex-wife <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON>, received a subpoena from <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON>. In a small claims action, the photographer is seeking $ 1,500 for copyright infringement over the use of two pictures in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1988 book, `` On The Outside Looking In.'' The pictures were taken during the 1980 GOP convention in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had copies of the pictures only for his private use, but publication was not authorized. <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> did n't receive credit in the book for the pictures, either. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a statement Tuesday, `` I regret that he was uncredited,'' but contended that <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> has been continually raising his prices for the photos. `` I lost my cool, which I should not have done, and I apologize for that,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` But I actually apologize more to my friends and my family for this kind of behavior which is caused by the pressures placed on me because of my position.'' <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> said the apology wo n't make him drop the police complaint. `` He seems to act erratically and it seems that he has a violent temper,'' said <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON>. `` I'm sorry he did n't handle the publication of the pictures properly to begin with and did n't deal with me honestly.'' Under <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law, it is a misdemeanor for a person to call another individual with intent to annoy and use obscene language or threaten to inflict injury. The maximum punishment is a six-month sentence and $ 1,000 fine.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s reputation for blizzards, howling winds and subzero cold may partly be blamed on its name, according to a legislative resolution that seeks to change it to simply `` Dakota.'' `` I have come to see the word <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> as having a much more poetic, romantic connotation than the term <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathern </PERSON>, who introduced two resolutions in the Legislature Wednesday calling for the change. State tourism director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuglie </PERSON> called the idea `` wonderful,'' but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON> said it would forsake a century's worth of history. `` If either of us wants to change our name now, we might as well call ourselves <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, because any name change now would deny 100 years or more of our heritage,'' <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> said he had n't thought about the issue, but `` I certainly do n't have any built-in opposition.'' One of <PERSON> Mathern </PERSON>'s two resolutions calls on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to amend federal enabling legislation to permit the name change. The 1889 act admitted <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The second resolution calls for a statewide election to make the necessary amendment to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Constitution. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> `` conveys an image of severe climactic conditions,'' according to the first resolution, while <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> `` conveys an image reflective of the pioneering spirit of the inhabitants of the state.'' <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, which means `` friend'' in the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> language, was the name for the territory that later became North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, as well as much of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. `` This is a serious look at the name of our state during our centennial year,'' said <PERSON> Mathern </PERSON>, a Democrat. `` It gives us a chance to look at what we feel good about, and want to take with us into our second century.'' The idea is not new. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Saueressig </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Bismarck </ORGANIZATION> advertising executive, said in 1983 he and others paid for a billboard that proclaimed: `` Let's drop ` North' and call it ` <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>.''' The proposal generated national publicity, but the idea did n't fly Some wags suggested dropping `` Dakota'' instead, and the proposal `` basically got laughed down,'' <PERSON> Saueressig </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mathern </PERSON>, however, said his suggestion was serious. `` For those people who, at some point, need to have some levity with this, I can understand that,'' he said. `` For me, it is not a joke.''

 A legislative committee has approved a bill requiring children's homes to report certain information to the state, a move sparked by widespread publicity on alleged abuse at a fundamentalist Christian boarding home. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure Tuesday without substantive debate.

Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>, chairman of the subcommittee that handled the bill, said the proposal would not infringe on religious rights of church-operated schools. The bill would require the homes to provide the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> with: _ Names, guardians and nearest relatives of all residents. _ Proof of inspections by a local fire department or the state fire marshal's office and the local health department. _ A statement that medical records are maintained on each child. The bill also would require the homes to file monthly reports with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and have on hand policies addressing discipline and parent-child communication. <PERSON> Huggins </PERSON> said he would have preferred seeing the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> as the agency receiving the reports rather than the Department of Health. He said he believed political fallout from the <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s raid on the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> Home for Children in <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION> last summer might have led to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> being the designated agency. On June 10, the <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> took temporary custody of 72 <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> children based on allegations of abuse and neglect. Most of the children taken from the home were released to parents or guardians, but the state took custody of 17. The Rev. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, a fundamentalist Baptist minister and founder of the controversial <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION>, has vowed to ignore any legislation that becomes state law. He claims the home is part of his church and is exempt from any kind of state regulation under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution.

<TEXT>
 A homeless man who lived in a secluded part of a hospital and was arrested in the murder of a physician there has been indicted by a grand jury, the prosecutor said Wednesday. District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> beat, raped, sodomized, strangled and robbed Dr. <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinnant </PERSON> in her fourth-floor office at <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on Jan. 7. Her husband and a hospital administrator found her body the next day, and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was arrested Jan. 9 after three homeless men said he gave them items belonging to the doctor to sell. A $ 30,000 reward was offered in the case. <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said the award money would be claimed, but declined to say by whom. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 23, was charged with two counts of second-degree murder _ one accusing him of intentionally killing her, the other charging that he caused her death while committing other felonies. The maximum sentence in either case is 25 years to life. He was also indicted on charges of first-degree robbery, rape and sodomy. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is being held without bail and will be arraigned in about 10 days, <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said. When arrested, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> admitted being at the murder scene but said another homeless man, whom he identified only as <PERSON> John </PERSON>, killed <PERSON> Hinnant </PERSON>. `` We have nothing to corroborate his statement that anyone else was involved,'' <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> lived in a maintenance and storage space on the 22nd floor of the vast hospital at least since before Christmas, police said. <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> stole the doctor's fur coat. He also removed a ring, bracelets and a watch from her body, but did not take them with him, the prosecutor said.

 Police on Wednesday ended the search for victims of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 disaster, with 17 bodies still missing out of the 270 people killed.

Inspector <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said police representatives last week visited relatives of the 17 missing to tell them of the plans to call off the search and hold the graveside service. He said seven were from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, three were from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, and seven were <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> residents.

Before they met, the pope's general weekly audience was briefly interrupted when a young man stood up and began shouting at the pope. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> guards took him out of the hall and the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> continued with his address. The man abruptly stood up and yelled out in English, `` Speak English,'' toward the end of the audience, when the pope reads greetings in several languages following a religious speech in Italian, a witness said.

The pope stopped speaking at first when the man began shouting but then resumed his speech and the audience applauded. However, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was forced to pause during the commotion when the guards rushed the man.

<HEAD>Quayle Promises No `Duck Hunting' for New Taxes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> vowed Wednesday the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wo n't go `` duck hunting'' for ways to hike taxes, even as other administration officials talked of ways to raise new revenues. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made a play on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` no new taxes'' pledge and Budget Director-designate <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s explanation of taxes to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in which he said, `` If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in his first policy speech since becoming vice president on Friday, said some people try to use the budget deficit as an excuse to go `` duck hunting'' for new taxes for their `` pet spending ideas.'' `` Remember the code word as we go into this budget battle this year _ no duck hunting, period,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told a conference of the Citizens for a <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` No hunting ducks, No hunting for taxes.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made the comments as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters at the White House that he would entertain an idea raised by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials to tax depositors who put money in federally insured institutions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he sees the idea as an option. But he deflected a question on whether that would not be considered a tax by asking whether an entrance fee to national parks is a tax. The proposed depositor fee would be 25 cents on every $ 100 deposited in federally insured institutions and the money would be used to help the ailing savings and loan industry. Accounts in commerical banks and credit unions also would be subject to such fees. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> reiterated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support for a presidential line-item veto of the annual budget, instead of the current system of accepting or rejecting the entire budget package. He said also that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should be held accountable through a vote when a president asks it to rescind appropriations for unnecessary spending that has already been approved. Currently the money must be spent unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acts on a president's recission request within 45 days. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should `` be forced to act within 15 days after a rescission request is sent to Capitol Hill.'' Such reforms would give the president `` a greater voice in how <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> spends the taxpayers' money.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> itself has a duty to its consitutents to work with the administration to spend our money more prudently and responsibly than it has in the past,'' he added. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> noted a Roper poll released Wednesday by the Citizens for a Sound Economy had said most Americans believe the government should hold down spending, not raise taxes, to cut the federal budget deficit. The in-person interviews with 1,947 adults nationwide found that 62 percent believed increased spending caused the deficit while 9 percent said inadequate revenues were the cause and 21 percent put the blame on a combination of spending and revenues. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the poll shows `` a broadly based distrust of the way our government operates in taxing and spending.'' The poll, conducted Dec. 3-10, also found 73 percent of those polled said the government should hold down spending to cut the deficit while 5 percent favored raising taxes and 12 percent wanted both options used. The poll also asked people their opinions on whether Social Security payments should have cost of living increases even if government spending were held to present levels for two years. Sixty-four percent favored Social Security increases in a spending-freeze situation while 26 percent were opposed. On new government programs, 43 percent of the respondents said they oppose creation of new government programs until the deficit is eliminated, while 40 percent favor new programs even with the deficit. Citizens for a Sound Economy is a conservative organization focusing on research and educational activities in economic issues.

<HEAD>Iraq Says War Could Resume</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Cabinet minister said Wednesday `` any spark'' on the 730-mile border with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could rekindle the war that was suspended in August after eight years and an estimated one million deaths. <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussayif </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasim </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s information minister, said in an interview the factionalized Iranian leadership does not seem capable of negotiating peace and talks will remain deadlocked until that changes. Special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliason </PERSON> met with Iranian leaders Wednesday in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in an attempt to revive the negotiations, which began in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Aug. 25, five days after a U.N.-supervised cease-fire took effect. <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> is expected in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> on Friday, perhaps with proposals from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Each side accuses the other of frustrating the negotiations. Iranian television said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> `` It is not acceptable that ... our territories are still occupied due to <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> subterfuges and delaying tactics.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims Iraqi soldiers still occupy 260 square miles of its territory. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is stalling for time to rebuild its military forces, which suffered several defeats last year and forced <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s regime to accept a truce. The Iraqis accuse <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of massing troops on the border. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers say the cease-fire is holding, despite claims by both sides of violations. Neither side has withdrawn from the truce line as stipulated by the terms, and <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> officials have said they see no point in resuming the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks unless the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> can guarantee progress. <PERSON> Jasim </PERSON> said: `` We believe <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> does not have the ability to make a decision regarding peace. That's why they want to maintain the no-war, no-peace situation.'' His apparent reference was to divisions in the Iranian hierarchy after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s decision last July 18 to accept a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution, Without a stable cease-fire `` any spark could lead once again to an unsolvable problem,'' the information minister said. He denied Western news reports that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was willing to make concessions on the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION>, which is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only sea outlet and was the prewar southern boundary between the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> neighbors. `` The Shatt-al-Arab is an Iraqi waterway,'' <PERSON> Jasim </PERSON> declared. The dispute over who controls the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON>, formed by the confluence of the <LOCATION> Tigris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Euphrates </LOCATION> rivers, helped start the war in September 1980. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after weeks of border skirmishes. A few days before the invasion, President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> abrogated a 1975 treaty drawing the boundary down the middle of the waterway. Before that treaty, the border had run along the eastern, Iranian bank, putting the waterway in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Control of the Shatt is at the center of the impasse in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jasim </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> must allow <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> free navigation through the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and its southern outlet, the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also wants the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> cleared of sunken ships and other debris under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision and negotiations on its status postponed until the job is done. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would have full rights to use the waterway after a settlement, <PERSON> Jasim </PERSON> said. He added that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` has no ambition for Iranian territory'' and is eager to conclude a peace treaty.

<TEXT>
 An unusually large jury was selected Wednesday to hear evidence against a man accused of terrorizing <LOCATION> Blackstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> residents with a series of sniper attacks two winters ago. Selection of the 16-member jury was completed after a last-minute appeal for more potential jurors. The original group of 25 jury canidates was exhausted because many would-be jurors were familiar with the sniper attacks, which received wide publicity. Juries normally contain 14 members, including two alternates, but two additional alternates were selected because the trial of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trepanier </PERSON> is expected to take four to six weeks, said prosecutor <PERSON> Eva-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>. <PERSON> Trepanier </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Burrillville </LOCATION>, is accused along with a high school classmate of 35 counts, including multiple charges of assault with intent to commit murder, arson, burglary, and conspiracy. The arson charges carry a potential sentence of life in prison. The classmate, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ducharme </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, is scheduled to go on trial after <PERSON> Trepanier </PERSON>'s case is finished. The charges stem in part from eight of 11 nighttime sniper attacks in December 1986 and January 1987 that forced <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smithfield </ORGANIZATION> residents to huddle behind drawn curtains. The attacks prompted Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> to call out the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, which patrolled for about six weeks.

 An alleged gang-rape victim forced under threat of jail to testify at trial was taken from the courthouse on a stretcher this morning as she was about to take the stand for a second day. It could not immediately be determined what was wrong with the woman or where the ambulance took her. The woman `` has fallen ill, so we're going to take other witnesses out of order'' until she returns, Judge <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinojosa </PERSON> told the jury. The woman had testified Tuesday until mid-afternoon, when she reported fainting during a break in her cross-examination. Earlier in the day, a defense attorney had suggested in opening arguments that she was sex-crazed. <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Chew </PERSON>, 29, is on trial on an aggravated kidnapping charge and also faces a sexual assault trial in the case. He was indicted with nine other men after the woman reported being abducted and raped by as many as 20 men in March. Her testimony in the case's first trial in September led to the sexual assault conviction of a 24-year-old man, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison. The woman asked to be excused from testifying in the Chew trial, and the prosecutor agreed to the request, but the judge on Tuesday compelled her to testify or go to jail for contempt of court. She said that publicity from the case disrupted her personal life and that the news media had harassed her. `` To a certain extent, I sympathize with what you've been going through, or what you say you've been going through,'' said the judge. `` But too much has happened for me to allow you to determine whether or not this case should proceed.'' Prosecution testimony continued this morning with investigator <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvan </PERSON> describing the woman as `` withdrawn, almost in shock'' the morning after the incident. Defense attorney <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> in his opening statement Tuesday said the trial would include testimony about `` women who have an insatiable desire for sex, women that just ca n't get enough, even with multiple men.'' He said a witness would testify the woman got willingly into a car with the men she said abducted her. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> also noted the woman's request to be excused from testifying, saying, `` You have to ask yourselves, ` Why? Why did n't she want to testify?' During her testimony Tuesday, the woman said she was pulled into a car with Chew and three other men, taken to a ranch where an illegal cockfight was being held and forced to perform sex acts with a number of men, including Chew.

<HEAD>Berkeley May Put Safe-Sex Kits Beside Hotel Bibles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 City officials hoping to stem the spread of AIDS are considering a proposal that would require innkeepers to put safe sex kits beside the good book in each hotel room. `` Certainly if hotels can have a <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bible </PERSON> in every room, they can include a safe sex kit,'' said nurse practitioner <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> Traiman </PERSON>, a clinical AIDS researcher who proposed the idea. `` There could be a sign with each kit saying, ` The Bible may save your soul, but this will save your life,''' said <PERSON> Traiman </PERSON>, who served on the city's AIDS health commission last year. The proposal was on Wednesday's agenda for the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and is also scheduled for a hearing before the city's <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> next month City Councilwoman <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, who chairs the council committee, said she is not sure safe-sex kits should be required by law. But she added, `` Given the crisis caused by AIDS, we must do all we can to educate the community. It's an issue that needs to be discussed.'' Each kit would contain condoms and information about how AIDS is transmitted. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he knows very little about the proposal but that it `` did n't seem like a half-bad idea.'' Not surprisingly, some hoteliers disagree. `` My boss is hitting the ceiling!'' said <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Flood </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Traveler </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION>, a few blocks from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's called the home office, and the home office has called <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and I'm not even going to tell you what <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> said,'' said <PERSON> Flood </PERSON>, whose hotel is owned by the British-based <ORGANIZATION> Trustforte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We are three blocks from the university. A lot of our clientele is associated with the university. They are mostly older people or professors or people from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>; it's not conducive to our clientele here,'' Flood said. She also worried that a faulty condom could leave the hotel vulnerable to a lawsuit. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodri </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, said his Mormon-run franchise places the Book of Mormon in each room and does n't even allow <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> in the gift shop. He said the hotel is not about to place condoms in the rooms. `` The Marriott organization has always stood for high morals and professional ethics,'' <PERSON> Rodri </PERSON> said. `` I think it could be difficult to ask a housekeeper of deep religious convictions to handle these types of items.'' <PERSON> Traiman </PERSON> said the idea was born last year when the city's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> tried to persuade hot tub and sauna owners to post AIDS warnings and to provide safe sex information. The managers of one sauna refused. `` They told us they would n't cooperate until there are safe sex kits in all hotel and motel rooms in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` ` Voila!,' we said. We all thought it was such a good idea that we decided to pursue it.''

 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> said shortly before he was slain on a hijacked <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner that he was ready to die to save the lives of other passengers, a witness testified Wednesday. Australian <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> court how she tried to comfort <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> after he had been badly beaten by the hijackers of Flight 847 in June 1985. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was later shot to death and his body thrown onto the runway at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport. Ms. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, 20, was testifying at the trial of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem charged with air piracy and murder in the hijacking of the Athens-to-Rome flight. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has admitted taking part in the hijacking but denies shooting <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said she sat next to <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> on the plane for several hours after <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, had been beaten. The witness, her voice often shaking, said she tried to lift <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s spirits by talking about everyday things. `` He was quite badly injured and he was crying,'' she told the court. `` His injuries included a bleeding head and back. His wrists had been tied very tightly and he had no feeling in his hands. His knees and ribs were very sore.'' She said <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> told her he ad been kicked in the ribs and knees. `` We talked about unimportant things, about his diving, about <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. By talking about normal things, he seemed to relax and forget the pain. It helped keep both our minds off the ordeal,'' Ms. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said. `` He was unable to light or hold a cigarette and I had to do it for him,'' she continued. `` He said that if he lived, he thought his life would never be the same again.'' `` He said how it may be better that he died. He believed that someone would die on the plane, someone from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> men, and he said that because he was the only one who was n't married, that he should be the one to die. He spoke with a clear mind,'' Ms. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> testified. There were six <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> divers on the plane. Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage 17 days during the ordeal. `` He did n't believe that all of us could get out alive. He felt it was fair that he dies so that the rest of us could live,'' the witness said. Ms. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said she did not know whether <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> or his accomplice, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON>, shot <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. The accomplice remains at large. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> listened attentively, his hair close-cropped after series of neurological examinations. He was arrested in January 1987 at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s airport after officials there discovered explosives in his luggage. The trial began in July in the heavily guarded courtroom inside Preungesheim prison.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> voiced firm support today for <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-designate <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> fully supports <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s opposition to abortion. In an interview with a small group of reporters in the Oval Office, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` none,'' when asked whether he foresaw any circumstances in which he would withdraw <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s nomination. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took issue with reports that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> disagrees with the president's position advocating a reversal by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of its landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion. `` He has supported my position 100 percent,'' the president said. `` I've not heard anyone suggesting that he will not be confirmed. I have n't heard one single person suggest that.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> met with a group of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators in the office of Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., and said, `` I found them to be very supportive. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was asked by reporters if he favored overturning <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. He responded only by saying, `` Once the hearings go forward everything will be cleared.'' `` He sort of gave us a preview of it and if he says what he said ... his preview was satisfactory,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, R-N.C. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., said of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, `` He was never in favor of retaining <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>.'' Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, an opponent of abortion, said that on the basis of his questioning of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> at the meeting he is convinced `` <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> believes in his heart that the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision should be overturned.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> had said he was concerned that some senators who met with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> in advance of his confirmation hearing next week reported the nominee personally supported the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortion. Asked after the meeting with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> if he had any reservations about the secretary-designate, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said, `` Not in my mind on the basis of this meeting.'' On Tuesday, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said he saw little likelihood the <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> nomination would be blocked. `` Let's put it plainly: Dr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> is the only black nominee to the Cabinet. It would be an embarrassment to the president, an embarrassment to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, if the nomination encountered any trouble and we do n't want that,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said then. `` We want to make the best of the situation and that's what we've been striving to do by encouraging the White House to surround <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> with people experienced in government and who would actively support the president on abortion,'' he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a bid to placate anti-abortion groups, will name <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> as undersecretary of <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>, an administration source, declining to be named publicly, said today. <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, is considered acceptable by anti-abortion lawmakers. The <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> appointment was initally reported by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, said that in his meeting with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, `` he said that personally he would favor abortions in three instances, the life of the mother, rape or incest. But he says that he's going to go with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policies, and I think that's responsible.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has said he favors abortion in those same circumstances. In addition, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> has said he opposes federal spending on abortions except for those three exceptions, a position <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has supported. According to Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore. and ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has scheduled a Feb. 1 confirmation hearing for <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the doctor was mystified by all the interest in the abortion issue `` I think he was stunned and not prepared for the fervor over something that he regarded as a relatively slight part of what would be his responsibilities, and he has the proportion right _ it is a slight part,'' said <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, who supports women's right to make their own decisions on abortion. <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>, with a nearly $ 400 billion budget this year, encompasses the Medicaid, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Social Security programs as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> said he was impressed with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and hoped he would not be hamstrung by anti-abortion concerns in his personnel appointments. `` I would hope that in picking someone who's going to head the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, that he'd pick somebody that has some knowledge about how we can contain health costs, not are they pro-choice or anti-choice on abortion,'' <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday he hopes the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s concern about inflation wo n't lead the central bank to stifle economic growth by driving up interest rates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he believes the economy is `` reasonably stable,'' and he added, `` There's no signals out there in the markets that this economy is in real trouble.'' The president's comments, in an Oval Office interview with two newspaper reporters, came one day after <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee that the central bank is likely to keep a tight grip on the money supply to control inflation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had not read <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s comments and preferred not `` to get into commenting on'' such testimony. He did say, `` I have n't talked to <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> lately, but I do n't want to see us move so strongly against the fear of inflation that we impede growth. We have to keep expanding opportunities for the working men and women of this country.'' Also Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s district banks reported stronger economic activity in December and early January, fueled by strength in retail sales and manfacturing. The report, based on surveys conducted by the 12 district banks, found little change in other sectors of the economy. Demand for bank loans was generally flat; construction work was subdued in most parts of the country, and continuing dry weather threatened the winter wheat crop in some areas. `` It would appear, on the basis of these reports, that the national economy gained momentum in recent weeks as consumer spending strengthened, manufacturing activity continued to rise and producers scheduled more investment in plant and equipment,'' said the report. The survey was prepared for the Feb. 7-8 meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s Open Market Commitee, the panel that sets monetary policy for the central bank. The Federal Reserve has appeared to be pushing up interest rates since March to dampen inflation pressures and contain economic growth. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, in his comments Tuesday, said that strains on factories' production capacity and a tight labor market could be expected to keep inflation pressures high and that the nation would `` risk a serious intensification of inflationary pressures at some not-too-distant point.'' Given the long-run costs of inflation, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> `` might well be advised to err more on the side of restrictiveness than of stimulus.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s survey of economic conditions found unexpectedly high retail sales throughout the country, including strong sales of new cars and trucks. In manufacturing, production was at or above November levels. Several industries were using most of their production capacity, but only a few, such as chemicals, reported that limits on capacity had constrained production. As use of capacity rises, economists fear factories will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases. In an indication of future activity, manufacturers reported plans to increase capital spending in the coming year, mostly for new equipment rather than to expand plants. While the survey found economic activity overall to be strong, the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> district reported `` indications that the pace of the advance may be slackening.'' The district reported that manufacturers expect to ease activity during the first half of the year and that retailers were generally cautious about sales and are keeping inventories under tight control.

 The pilot of a plane that crashed last April, killing the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> secretary of state, may not have been medically qualified to fly and may have suffered a heart attack just before the crash, federal authorities say. Crashes like the one that killed <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Waltermire </PERSON> have resulted in a recommendation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> tighten regulation of the medical condition of pilots, an investigator said. <PERSON> Waltermire </PERSON>, 39, and the 64-year-old pilot, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, died April 8 when the twin-engine plane they were flying crashed in a snowstorm. At the time, <PERSON> Waltermire </PERSON> was the leading candidate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. He was returning to <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> after a campaign appearance. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> report did not decide the cause of the crash, saying the airplane was destroyed and there was little evidence on what happened before the crash. However, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigator <PERSON> Verlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tranter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' medical history suggests that he `` may have suffered an acute incapacitating event'' such as a heart attack or stroke under the stress of the difficult landing. <PERSON> H.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> flight surgeon in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> who reviewed <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' file after the crash, said Tuesday that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> had heart problems and high blood pressure that required drugs to control. Authorities at the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Aeromedical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Certification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, concerned about <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' heart problems, had written to the pilot only three days before the crash asking for more medical information, <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said. Had that review been begun earier, officials said, the veteran pilot may have been found medically unfit to continue flying. But they stressed that at the time of the crash, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' permission to fly had not been revoked and he had done nothing illegal. `` I do n't think Mr. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was trying to violate anything,'' <PERSON> Tranter </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` But he was getting up there in years.'' <PERSON> Tranter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> had a valid certificate for a commercial pilot. But in a telephone interview Wednesday, <PERSON> Tranter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> may have held the certificate only because lax supervision of medical records at the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> branch. He said that when a medical certificate is issued after a quick examination, the examination report is sent to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> center for more detailed evaluation. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> center can ask for more information if it doubts a pilot's fitness to fly _ as it did in <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' case. During that evaluation, the certificate remains valid. <PERSON> Tranter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> had a history of `` ischemic events'' _ similar to minor heart attacks _ and an electrocardiogram suggested possible heart muscle damage. But <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> showed no symptoms of heart disease and denied experiencing chest pain. `` Nevertheless,'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said, `` the conditions were in place to explain an acute cardiovascular event. The severe stress he was encountering in landing that plane could have been the precipitating factor.'' <PERSON> Tranter </PERSON> said that as a result of the Waltermire crash and similar incidents, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> has recommended the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> change its procedures, possibly by revoking a medical certificate immediately if the evaluation center has doubts about a pilot's medical fitness.

<HEAD>Warheads Reportedly Removed from Five MX Missiles after Accident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> removed the warheads from five of its 50 MX nuclear missiles late last year after a summertime accident in which one missile came loose and fell to the bottom of its underground silo, according to a published report. The five missiles were part of the same production lot and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> investigators discovered a common problem that forced the safety action, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The service is still trying to decide how to repair the five missiles, each of which is designed to carry 10 warheads, the paper added, quoting unidentified sources. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> refused to confirm the account on Wednesday, acknowledging only that a single MX missile had been taken off alert last June following an accident. That accident previously had been reported by newspapers in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, where F.E. <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> is located. The nation's MX, or Peacekeeper, missiles are all deployed at F.E <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> also insisted Wednesday, without elaborating, that the nation's entire MX force of 50 missiles was on alert `` at this time.'' `` We have 50 missiles that are deployed and operational at this time,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Christianson </PERSON>, a spokesman at F.E. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>. <PERSON> Christianson </PERSON> refused to say whether any problem missiles had been replaced with new missiles in order to maintain the alert force. The spokesman agreed, however, that one MX missile had been taken off alert, its warheads removed and its components broken down as part of a safety investigation after an incident last June. `` Last summer, we received indications of an electrical disconnection with a Peacekeeper -LRB- MX -RRB- missile inside its silo,'' <PERSON> Christianson </PERSON> said. `` An investigation was conducted, and a structural failure in a support skirt was found to be the cause. There was no safety threat. The reports of the investigation are classified, however, so I ca n't go further. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday the missile had fallen between six inches and a foot when it came `` unglued'' from its underground launch canister. The canister envelops the missile and is used to propel the four-stage MX from its silo before the main rocket motor is ignited. The newspaper said the fall of the 195,000-pound missile was sufficient to cause `` grave damage'' and to require `` extensive repairs.'' And when the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> further investigated the matter, it concluded the missile was one of a batch of five that had been subject to a particular production problem, the paper said. Air Force officials responded by ordering removal of the 10-warhead packages atop each of the other four suspect missiles to relieve the weight and pressure on their canister bonds pending corrective action, the paper concluded. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> so far has been authorized to build 50 of the missiles and to deploy them at F.E. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>. Former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pushed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for permission to build 50 more MX missiles and to base them on mobile rail-car launchers. The administration of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has yet to make a final decision on whether to push that same program or endorse another program to develop a truck-mounted, single-warhead Midgetman nuclear missile.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Wednesday created an Office of Labor of the Holy See that a union representing <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> law workers had been requesting for 10 years. The office, described as a ministry of labor for the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, will open March 1.

The pontiff announced his intentions to institute such an office in a document he issued last year on reforms in the curia. <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerullo </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> Lay Workers, called the creation of the office a positive development.

In the protest, the workers performed their jobs but pledged to donate their first three hours pay to the pope to help feed the poor. Archbishop <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schootte </PERSON>, a Belgian who handles <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> labor relations, said at the time that the protest was unjustified and that negotiations were in progress toward creating the office.

 Officials of the <LOCATION> Byelorussian </LOCATION> republic plan to build a monument to the estimated 30,000 victims of political executions carried out in a forest during <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s rule, a newspaper reported Wednesday. The government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazai </PERSON>, a deputy premier of <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>, as saying that 510 mass graves have been found in the <LOCATION> Kuropaty </LOCATION> area near the republic's capital of <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Mazai </PERSON>, who chairs a commission investigating the killings, said six graves, each containing the remains of 50-60 people, have been excavated. Workers have found cartridge cases, bullets and clothes, and these objects have been analyzed using a laser, she told <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Mazai </PERSON> said at least 30,000 people were buried at <LOCATION> Kuropaty </LOCATION>, down from previous estimates that more than 100,000 had been killed there. The exact figure can not be determined, she said. The mass executions were carried out by the secret police, which at the time was called the <ORGANIZATION> NKVD </ORGANIZATION>, from 1937 to 1941, and the commission is trying to determine the motive for the slayings and the identities of the victims, the official said. A competition for design of a monument to the victims is being organized by the Byelorussian Culture Ministry, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION> city government and the unions of architects and artists. In October, the weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported that men and women branded `` enemies of the people'' under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> were brought alongside newly dug ditches at <LOCATION> Kuropaty </LOCATION> and made to stand in rows. They were then gagged and shot, the newspaper said. The article said Soviet authorities tried to cover up what had happened at <LOCATION> Kuropaty </LOCATION>. Under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, millions of innocent Soviets lost their lives or were imprisoned in a campaign of terror. Revalations of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s crimes have flooded the Soviet press since <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power and instituted his campaign for openness four years ago

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today named an eight-member panel to recommend ethical standards for government officials, saying he wants an unambigious code of conduct to avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this week is making ethics a continuing theme, to ensure that he does not face the allegations of an administration `` sleaze factor'' that dogged his predecessor. `` We need an unambiguous code, a code of conduct, to ensure that those who serve the public trust avoid any actual or apparent conflict between their personal and public interest,'' he said in setting up the Commission on <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> by executive order. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said current ethics rules `` do not adequately serve to eliminate use of public funds for private gains.'' He said the laws are fragmented and confusing. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered his new commission to give him recommendations for new legislation by March 9. The panel's chairmen are <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, the former attorney general in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, and <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkey </PERSON>, a senior judge on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Other panel members are former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsels Fred Fielding and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baran </PERSON>, former Rep. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, former counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolsey </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Bello </PERSON>, former counsel to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative's office. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked the director of the Office of Government Ethics, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON>, to brief all senior administration officials on ethical and conflict-of-interest standards required of them, said White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had proposed during his campaign that such briefings be held on an annual basis, and <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON> wrote to him on the day after the Nov. 8 election offering to conduct the sessions, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the 10-minute meeting with <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON> on Tuesday was for `` symbolic value'' to emphasize the importance <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attaches to ethical conduct. More than 100 members of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> served as vice president, were at various times accused of unethical or improper behavior. Two of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s closest advisers, <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>, were convicted of offenses associated with their lobbying after they left the administration, while a string of allegations against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s longtime friend and attorney general, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, battered the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. An independent prosecutor declined to seek indictment of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s own ethics office concluded this month that he had engaged in conduct `` that should not be tolerated of any government employee.'' Democrats assailed the `` sleaze factor'' and used it as ammunition in the fall campaigns. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded by saying repeatedly that he intended to have an administration that hews to high ethical standards. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supported President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of ethics legislation passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year, but said he wants to introduce his own package. It is expected to contain the same standards, where applicable, for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as it sets for the executive branch employees. Last year's package set differing standards. The new commission will take testimony on simplification or expansion of current ethics rules, and will make recommendations to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for legislation on the issue. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has put his White House legal counsel <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> in charge of coordinating ethics policy. On Thursday the president will continue to spotlight the issue by meeting with senior executive employees to `` emphasize the ethics provisions of the law and their responsibilities and what he expects of them,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. On Friday, he will talk to the inspectors general of the government departments to emphasize their role in ethics enforcement.

 A sheriff brought 69 prisoners from his jail to the state Capitol on Wednesday to dramatize the jail overcrowding he and other sheriffs say the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> must remedy. DeKalb County Sheriff <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> said he sent the prisoners back to <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> after he was threatened with arrest for criminal trespassing. The prisoners never left the two jail buses, and <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> said he never intended to take them into the Capitol, where groups of schoolchildren toured. It was a part of a protest by sheriffs and their representatives from across <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> who are forced to house more than 4,100 state prisoners because state prisons have no room. State prisons currently house about 18,700 prisoners, 43 percent more than they were designed to hold. Gov. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> ordered the buses away, calling the display `` totally irresponsible.'' <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> denied the charge, saying he had informed Capitol security guards and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> police they were coming. `` This is not a sideshow, this is business,'' <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> said of the protest. He described the prisoners as non-violent. <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> said the demonstration was to support <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Bill 149, which would let counties decide whether they want to accept overflow state prisoners for long periods. <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, who said his jail leads the state with 250 overflow state prisoners, was asked where the state should put them if it ca n't require counties to house them `` That's not my problem. Where am I going to put them?'' he said. Under current law, counties can be forced to accept the inmates. They are paid $ 15 a day per prisoner, which <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> said is about half the actual cost. Hall County Sheriff <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecum </PERSON>, whose jail had a costly uprising blamed on overcrowding during the Christmas holidays, said legislative priorities are skewed. `` If <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> wants to build a stadium let them build a domed stadium. But let them pay for it; leave us out of it,'' he said at a news conference inside the Capitol. He was referring to legislation that would pay for a domed stadium with hotel-motel tax revenues. The $ 7 billion-plus budget proposed by <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> for fiscal 1990 includes no money for more prisons, even though Corrections Commissioner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> has asked for 7,100 new prison beds, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffries </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Clarke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>. Many county jails have more state overflow inmates alone than they have beds, said Sheriff <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Burke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriffs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He said his jail, with 22 beds, has 44 inmates he was forced to accept from the state. He said sheriffs are being hit with lawsuits spurred by overcrowding, poor hygiene and riots. Just this week, overcrowded jails in <LOCATION> Colquitt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turner </LOCATION> counties reported minor uprisings, and overcrowding was a factor in recent disturbances at prisons in <LOCATION> Milledgeville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` These things are going to continue to pop up as long as we've got too many prisoners,'' <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> said

 Passengers miffed that a train skipped their stop delayed the train for 19 minutes in protest, sparking a counter-rebellion by riders who wanted the train to proceed, authorities said Wednesday. `` Human oversight and human error'' were the reasons why the 7 p.m. <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> train from Grand Central breezed by the Fleetwood station Tuesday night, said <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brucker </PERSON>. The train, due to stop in <LOCATION> Fleetwood </LOCATION>, at 7:26 p.m., skipped the stop to the consternation of the 50 to 60 passengers who wanted to get off there and pulled in three minutes later at <LOCATION> Bronxville </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Brucker </PERSON>. Angry commuters delayed the train for 19 minutes by holding the doors open as they demanded explanations from the engineer and train crew. Some passengers insisted the train back up the three-quarters of a mile to the bypassed station, but <PERSON> Brucker </PERSON> said to do so would have violated federal regulations. Witnesses said a counter-rebellion broke out when commuters headed for stations up the line tried to remove the Fleetwood passengers from the doorways. About 1,500 passengers were on the train, <PERSON> Brucker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brucker </PERSON> said dispatchers ordered a southbound express train to stop at the <LOCATION> Bronxville </LOCATION> station and pick up the Fleetwood passengers at 8:10 p.m. The railroad may consider disciplinary charges against the engineer, who was not identified, the spokesman said.

<HEAD>Authorities Raid Companies, Homes in Libya Plant Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities Wednesday raided the offices of three companies and the homes of 12 people in an investigation of allegations that West German firms helped <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> build a suspected chemical weapons plant. Some politicians, meanwhile, accused Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government of bungling <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s initial response to the allegations, and a magazine reported that companies had helped <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> build a rocket factory Customs authorities searched the offices and homes `` on suspicion that export laws had been violated'' with deliveries to the Libyan plant, said <PERSON> Hubertus </PERSON> <PERSON> Voegele </PERSON>, spokesman for the prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Offenburg </LOCATION>. He declined to identify the businesses searched, but confirmed that the Imhausen-Chemie firm of <PERSON> Lahr </PERSON> was among them. Imhausen-Chemie is suspected of playing a major role in building the factory in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, about 60 miles south of the Libyan capital of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> intends to produce poison gas at the plant. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says it is a pharmaceutical factory. West German officials who conducted the searches in cities throughout the country seized a huge quantity of material, especially from Imhausen-Chemie, that will take time to examine, <PERSON> Voegele </PERSON> said. `` Up to now there are no grounds for any arrests, but we have a lot of material to go through,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Allegations of West German involvement in the Libyan plant came to light late last year. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government at first denied any wrongdoing by West German firms, and exonerated <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen-Chemie </ORGANIZATION> after an investigation earlier this month. But officials have acknowledged over the past two weeks that several companies appear to have provided materials or know-how to the Libyans, including a company owned by the government, <ORGANIZATION> Salzgitter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industriebau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>. A day after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators accused <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government of looking the other way during such operations, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the West German parliament met in special session Wednesday to discuss official handling of the affair. Members of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> singled out Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> for criticism. Lawmaker <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gansel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> `` did nothing'' after learning from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> last May that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suspected West German firms of involvement with the Libyan plant. Another prominent Social Democrat, <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Voigt </PERSON>, said it was `` unbelievable'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> could have been uninformed for months about intelligence reports that West German firms helped with the plant. <PERSON> Voigt </PERSON> said the scandal had reduced <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s international prestige to `` a low point.'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> on Wednesday for talks that centered on the scandal. <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> assured him <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would do its best to see that the Libyan plant would not be used to produce chemical weapons. `` We want to make sure that the teeth of the tiger get pulled,'' <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> said. Also Wednesday, the weekly magazine <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said West German companies were `` heavily involved'' in an Iraqi rocket development project. West German companies had shipped technology and equipment to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for a `` research and development center that by all indications is a rocket factory,'' the magazine said. It described the factory as a heavily guarded plant near the city of <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION>, about 210 miles north of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> identified the project's general contractor as Gildemeister Projekta of <LOCATION> Bielefeld </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Gildemeister </ORGANIZATION> official said the company had made deliveries for the facility, but called <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s contention that it was for rocket production was `` utterly ridiculous.'' `` We are building a laboratory and workshop complex that resembles facilities at universities and technical colleges,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` There is no way to produce rockets there. At best you can run a few little experiments,'' he said. The official said <ORGANIZATION> Gildemeister </ORGANIZATION> obtained federal export licenses for all shipments. Economics Minister <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> confirmed his ministry had one authorization on file from June. <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON>, who two weeks ago announced tougher measures to protect against export violations, said better international coordination is needed to limit the spread of arms and chemical weapons technology. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is the world's fifth-largest supplier of arms and exports at least half of its chemical production each year. Because of its dependence on raw material imports and income from manufactured-goods exports, <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> has taken a less-confrontational approach toward nations such as <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and has avoided trade sanctions as a lever in political disputes.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opened for business Wednesday, and senators, like merchants at a bazaar, quickly lined up to offer a dizzying array of legislative proposals. And like a bazaar, some of the offerings were shiny new, some were somewhat shopworn and others were tired and battered and dulled after years of legislative mauling. Among Wednesday's actions: _ A bipartisan group of senators, opposed to a 50 percent congressional pay raise, proposed legislation that would roll back the increase if the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lets it become law by ducking a vote The dozen sponsors, split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, made clear they wanted to turn up the pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ which appears headed toward allowing the large increase to become law automatically. Chief <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsors <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, said the rollback provision of their bill would keep the pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> even if the pay raise becomes law through <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> inaction. _ A proposal for a uniform closing time for polls across the country during presidential election years The proposal, by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., was designed to eliminate television network projections of presidential races before the polls are closed in Western _ A bill from Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., that would provide cost of living increases in compensation, rehabilitation, education and training benefits paid to veterans who have service-connected _ Legislation by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Del., and <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., that would put the federal budget on a two-year cycle instead of the current yearly _ A renewed effort from Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., to raise the nation's minimum wage from $ 3.35 to $ The increase, which would be the first in eight years, died in the closing days of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. _ An `` ethics in government'' act proposed by Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, that was approved by the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but vetoed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last November The bill restricts former members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from lobbying the legislative branch and top executive branch officials for 12 months after leaving government service. _ A <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign finance reform proposal that would, among other things, restrict political action committees from giving more than $ 1,000 to any one candidate, compared to $ 5,000 under present law _ Another Republican bill, by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, that would require a report from the president on what foreign nations are aiding in the production of chemical weapons That bill would trigger sanctions against such companies, prohibiting them from exporting goods into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. _ Another <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> bill would gradually repeal the `` earnings test,'' which restricts the amount retirees under the age of 70 may earn without losing a portion of their Social Security pension The law permits retirees under 65 to earn up to $ 6,480 a year without penalty; those 65 to 69 may earn $ 8,880. For each additional dollar earned, the beneficiary loses 50 cents of Social Security. _ A proposal by Sen. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., calling for an `` international alliance for environmental progress The package would include legislation designed to confront the so-called greenhouse effect and promote global cooperation on environmental issues. _ An AIDS bill proposed by <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> that would establish a grant program to help communities develop coordinated systems of care to people infected with the disease _ Also landing in the hopper was a bill to provide more than $ 1.7 billion to carry out programs contained in last fall's omnibus narcotics law <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved the drug bill last year but left town without furnishing federal agencies with the funds to carry out most of the programs. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is ready to work with the administration to stop the scourge of drugs,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, in unveiling the measure he is sponsoring with Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Herpes Virus May Help AIDS Virus Cause Disease, Study Suggests</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For release at 6 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A recently discovered herpes virus may activate the AIDS virus and join with it to kill critical disease-fighting blood cells in AIDS, a test-tube study says. Blood cells infected with both viruses died faster than those infected with just the AIDS virus, researchers reported in Thursday's issue of the British journal Nature. The herpes virus had previously been identified in many people with acquired immune deficiency sydrome, the researchers said. The possible role of the virus in AIDS was discussed publicly last year by one of the study's co-authors, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. At that time <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said the virus, called herpesvirus-6, appears to be harmless or produce only mild disease in people not also infected by the AIDS virus, called HIV-1. Herpesvirus-6, discovered in 1986, differs from its better-known cousins that that cause cold sores or genital infections. The new work is reported by scientists at the cancer institute and <ORGANIZATION> Bionetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, Md. They found that blood cells infected with herpesvirus-6 plus the AIDS virus died faster than those infected with either virus alone. The combination killed faster than would be expected if each virus were acting independently, researchers said. Researchers also found evidence that herpesvirus-6 could make the AIDS more active within cells, and that it could activate a segment of genetic material in the AIDS virus that regulates reproduction.

 Officials on Wednesday abandoned hope of finding any more survivors of the earthquake and mudslide that inundated three mountain villages, and said this settlement would be dedicated as a common grave. Along with the bad news that no more survivors could expect to be found, there also was good news: officials said the death toll from Monday's disaster was only about a quarter of the 1,000 they originally had estimated. In addition, a young man described how his 6-day-old cousin miraculously survived the quake, held aloft in her father's hands as he and his household died in a torrent of mud. <PERSON> Kholmurod </PERSON> <PERSON> Barotov </PERSON>, 17, a worker in a <LOCATION> Sharora </LOCATION> bakery, said his mother had gone to stay with her sister, who had just given birth to a daughter. His aunt's house was completely buried by the mudslide, but the little girl survived because her father, 30-year-old herdsman <PERSON> Saifulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Khodzhayev </PERSON>, held her above his head as he and the rest of the family died, he said. `` We will transform the settlement of <LOCATION> Sharora </LOCATION> into a common grave with a monument to commemorate the victims of this catastrophe,'' said <PERSON> Khusain </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasymov </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in the <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION> republic's Gissar region. The religious leader of predominantly Moslem <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kakharov </PERSON>, participated in discussions leading to that decision, media reports said. `` Regrettably, there is no one left who can be saved,'' he told the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. `` Let the remains of the deceased remain at the place where they died.'' `` Moslem law, the Shariah, says that people buried alive must be left there,'' said <PERSON> Izzatullo </PERSON> <PERSON> Khayoyev </PERSON>, prime minister of the Central Asian republic. He said relatives of those killed in <LOCATION> Sharora </LOCATION> decided to fence off the farming settlement and make it into a common grave. Within 12 hours of the quake and mudslide that struck the area early Monday, the official news media estimated that as many as 1,000 people might have died. But <PERSON> Khayoyev </PERSON> told reporters in an impromptu interview Wednesday that 274 people were confirmed dead. `` There may be a differnce of five or seven people in casualties, but no more,'' he said. He said a nationwide census completed only four days before the quake struck helped provide a quick and accurate count of the villages' residents. Officials said the earthquake, which was recorded as 5.4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, toppled all 80 brick-and-straw dwellings in the settlement of Okuli-bolo, located on the north side of the <LOCATION> Babatag </LOCATION> hills about 20 miles southwest of the <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION> capital <LOCATION> Dushanbe </LOCATION>. The quake loosened saturated soil on both sides of the hill. On the north side, it came crashing down in seconds onto <LOCATION> Sharora </LOCATION>, which was located next to Okuli-bolo. But on the south side, about 1 -RCB- miles away, the mud slipped slowly down the hill toward Okuli-poyen. The town was destroyed, but residents managed to escape in time. All flags were at half-staff, plays and concerts were canceled, and restaurants were shut down in <LOCATION> Dushanbe </LOCATION> and across the small republic as a day of mourning was declared. <PERSON> Khayoyev </PERSON> said losses were estimated at $ 24 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. He said 75 people had been hospitalized in <LOCATION> Dushanbe </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gissar </PERSON> and that 17 had been discharged. The homeless were being put up in mobile wagons, shepherds' dwellings and tent, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said The number of people involved was not given. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the destroyed villages would be rebuilt elsewhere. `` A was taken to rebuild at a new place the village of <LOCATION> Sharora </LOCATION>, which had been turned into a common grave by underground shocks. Designers also pinpointed places for other ravaged villages,'' it said. `` Construction will start in several days' time.''

 A routine inspection of an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet arriving from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> failed to reveal a cache of hidden cocaine, but string holding the drug packets in place broke and the cocaine dropped into view, authorities said Wednesday.

But the string holding the drug above a lavatory broke, and packets fell through a ceiling panel, Customs agents said. A second search revealed 47 pounds of cocaine above the lavatories and in two exit doors. The placement seemed to indicate `` someone with extensive access to the aircraft and extensive knowledge of its structure'' had stored the drug, Customs said in a news release. No arrests were made.

 In a rare public admission, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Wednesday a news leak about a bailout plan for the savings and loan industry was `` a trial balloon'' floated by the administration to gauge reaction.

After fielding numerous questions, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> finally told a packed news briefing, `` What you're looking at today is a trial balloon.'' As laughter arose from the press, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> continued, `` And we're willing to talk about it, willing to discuss it and we'll see how it flies. But there will be other trial balloons and I trust you'll all be here for those explanations, too.''

Shortly after his briefing, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> circulated through the press room to change his story, saying he was `` back-pedaling on the trial balloon.'' He said he was wrong in suggesting <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> went on television to sell the savings and loan plan. Instead, he said, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> had consented to the interviews to talk about leveraged buyouts, and was hit with questions about <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L plan in the wake of the Post story. `` It was not an intentional trial-balloon,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A man whose flag-burning conviction in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is the focus of a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case on the limits of permissible public protest said Wednesday that setting fire to the American flag is his idea of `` a thousand points of light.'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Joey </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference the court case is an opportunity to examine the real meaning of the flag. Around the world `` wherever people rise up ... quite often one of the first things they do is torch the red, white and blue,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` Now that's what I call a thousand points of light.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s sarcastic echo of one of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign themes underscored the timely nature of the court dispute. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, stressing patriotic values during his campaign, attacked Democratic opponent Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> for vetoing legislation to require that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> public school teachers lead their classes in the Pledge of Allegiance. The high court announced last October it will consider reinstating <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s flag-burning conviction that was overturned by a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> appeals court. The state court said burning the flag was a form of symbolic expression protected by the Constitution. The high court is expected to hear arguments in the case in March or April and announce a decision by July. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 32, and living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> now, was sentenced to a year in jail and fined $ 2,000 for his part in a demonstration during the 1984 Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The protest culminated with a rally in front of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> in which demonstrators poured lighter fluid on an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag and ignited it. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Wednesday he had no part directly in igniting the flag although he approved the action and gave speeches during the rally. He said he believed he was singled out for prosecution because the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police knew he was a member in the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, which is representing <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, filed a legal brief with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday urging it not to revive <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s conviction. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the case `` seems to be a return to the 1960s'' when protests against the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> were reaching their peak. He said the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> `` is saying that it and it alone can define the meaning of the flag and that it can prohibit private citizens acting in a political context from using even their own flag for any purpose contrary to that defined by the state.'' The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law used to prosecute <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> forbids `` the desecration of a venerated object'' if that is likely to cause `` serious offense.'' Police officers who arrested <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said they were seriously offended by the flag burning. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said many states _ as well as the federal government _ have laws against burning the flag, although it does not appear there are many cases where the statutes have been enforced. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1974 threw out the conviction of a college student who taped a peace symbol onto a flag. The court in 1943 ruled that the government may not compel citizens to salute the flag. But the justices never have decided whether laws against destruction of the flag are constitutional.

<TEXT>
 The government wants substantial cuts in the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear warheads in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as part of its goal of reducing to an `` absolute minimum'' the role of the weapons there, it was reported Wednesday. The ZDF network quoted from a position paper prepared by various government ministries in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. It did not say when the document was approved. The government position still calls for `` effective'' nuclear forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, despite the envisioned reductions, and views the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence as `` irreplaceable,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been reassessing its stance on nuclear missiles in hopes of improving ties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION>. The missile issue remains particularly sensitive in this country on the front lines of the <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> conflict. For example, Defense Minister <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON>'s statement earlier this month that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would agree to the replacement of 600 Lance short-range missiles sparked such a furor he later retracted it. <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> said that according to the document, `` the federal government wants to cut the role of nuclear weapons to the ` absolute minimum necessary.''' `` The number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear warheads stored in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> should be reduced unilaterally _ probably to less than 2,900 from the current number of approximately 4,600,'' it quoted the document as saying. `` However, a necessary minimum needed for the credible deterrence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> should be kept,'' <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> said in reporting the government's stance <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Col. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Widder </PERSON> said most of the report already was public knowledge. However, <PERSON> Widder </PERSON> refused to confirm the federal government was aiming to cut the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear warheads to less than 2,900. West Germans have applauded the removal of intermediate-range nuclear missiles provided for in the treaty signed in December 1987 by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> has been leading the calls for further steps toward disarmament and for greater trust in Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. West German public opinion polls have shown a growing trust in the Soviet bloc. A new survey presented by <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> as part of its report Wednesday said 88 percent of those polled do not feel militarily threatened by Soviet bloc countries. It said only 10 percent were in favor of replacing the aging Lance missiles pointed at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> said the poll was conducted by an outside research institute and surveyed 1,017 West German citizens. It did not provide a margin of error.

<DATELINE>OFFENBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prosecutors today searched the offices of three West German companies and the homes of 12 people suspected of helping <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> build a chemical weapons factory, authorities said. A spokesman for the prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Offenburg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hubertus </PERSON> <PERSON> Voegele </PERSON>, said one of the firms was Imhausen-Chemie in <LOCATION> Lahr </LOCATION>, which is suspected of playing a major role in building and equipping the Libyan plant. <PERSON> Voegele </PERSON> said the searches were conducted `` on suspicion that export laws had been violated.'' He declined to name the other firms whose offices were searched, but added they were located throughout the country. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government says the plant at <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, 60 miles south of the Libyan capital of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, was built to make poison gas. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says it will manufacture medicine. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> officials initially dismissed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations, but have now launched a criminal investigation to determine if Imhausen-Chemie and other companies illegally shipped arms, hazardous substances or components that can be used to produce them. The affair has deeply embarassed the West German government. On Tuesday, news reports said an Imhausen-Chemie employee had confirmed allegations the company played a key role in building the Libyan plant. The weekly Stern magazine said Imhausen-Chemie and a government-owned company were aware that blueprints that were supposed to be shipped to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to build a pharmaceuticals plant had ended up in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television network late Tuesday reported that <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a technical draftsman with Imhausen-Chemie, `` is said to have given evidence that <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen </ORGANIZATION> shipped parts and chemicals to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, and further that <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen </ORGANIZATION> employees helped build the facility in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>.'' ARD did not disclose the source of its information, but said the details were confirmed by the prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Karlsruhe </LOCATION>. The television also did not say if the employees traveled to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to work on the plant. Imhausen-Chemie has denied accusations it was involved in the <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> plant. This week's <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said an official at Imhausen-Chemie told investigators that officials at <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen </ORGANIZATION> and the government-owned <PERSON> Salzgitter </PERSON> <PERSON> Industriebau </PERSON> knew shipments of <LOCATION> Salzgitter </LOCATION> blueprints ended up in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> instead of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. The magazine did not name the official and it was not known whether it was the same person identified in the ARD report. <LOCATION> Salzgitter </LOCATION> officials acknowledged last week that the firm had done business with <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen-Chemie </ORGANIZATION>, but said it involved construction of a pharmaceuticals plant in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Salzgitter </LOCATION> officials late Tuesday denied any involvement in the <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> project. In its report, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> also said it had been clear to experts working for <LOCATION> Salzgitter </LOCATION> that the Libyan plant was not designed as a small factory for pharmaceuticals but as a `` large chemical plant for the production of highly poisonous substances.'' The magazine reported last week that <LOCATION> Salzgitter </LOCATION>, which manufactures steel products and industrial equipment, delivered blueprints for the Libyan plant. <PERSON> Voegele </PERSON> has confirmed that an Imhausen-Chemie employee had been questioned but declined to reveal what that person told investigators. Last week, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> project, called `` Pharma 150,'' was devised to disguise involvement by Imhausen-Chemie in helping build the plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, which has the same name. The magazine said this week that <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION>, the giant West German electrical firm, sold switching and measuring equipment for `` Pharma 150.'' <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON> said the company had delivered equipment to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and said it had not done anything wrong. Stern telexed its report Tuesday to other news organizations in advance of Thursday's publication.

 A government science panel has dismissed as `` seriously flawed'' a study that concluded <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans suffered post-war physical problems due to exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange. A report sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday concluded that data in the study conducted for the American Legion `` do not support the conclusions drawn by the authors.''

 Sixteen drug smugglers were hanged in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Wednesday, following a major anti-narcotics crackdown backed by a draconian new law, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported. Ten key members of a large, armed gang were hanged in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, two smugglers were executed in neighboring <LOCATION> Varamin </LOCATION>, and four in western <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION> province said the broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. These deaths raised to 89 the number of drug smugglers executed since the crackdown started Jan. 16. More than 1,000 people have been arrested in the same period in what Iranian newspapers describe as `` the biggest crackdown on drug smuggling in Iranian history.'' The new anti-narcotics law, which went into effect Saturday, carries the death penalty for possession of just over an ounce of heroin and for 11 pounds of opium or hashish. The broadcast said those executed were responsible for smuggling more than 17,380 pounds of opium, 237 pounds of heroin and 1,531 pounds of morphine. Police also seized weapons, ammunition and vehicles found in the smugglers' hideouts. The broadcast did not say whether the smugglers brought drugs into or out of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Iranian smugglers often are involved both in importing drugs from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and exporting drugs through <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> countries.

 Confining the 250 men on death row to their cells creates dangerous suspicions among them, a convicted murderer testified Wednesday as a hearing on a federal lawsuit convened in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> prison. Lead-off witness <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Alcala </PERSON>, convicted of kidnapping and murdering a 12-year-old girl, called for allowing the prisoners to mingle on tiers outside the cells, so `` you know what everybody's attitude is, what's going on in everybody's head. `` It's like if you live in a neighborhood and there's one guy who never comes out of his house, you do n't know what the guy's going to do. ... That's pretty important in our situation.'' The men awaiting possible execution in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> gas chamber were called to testify in a lawsuit that claims state prison officials are violating a 1980 court order on their housing and treatment in an isolated wing of the institution. Among other things, the lawsuit contends the inmates are not given adequate access to the prison law library, are improperly prohibited from leaving their cells in the daytime, and are denied some of the exercise equipment and personal items guaranteed by the court order. The state agreed to abide by the order in 1980, but officials say it has become obsolete and should be relaxed or repealed. State officials say the growth in death row population from 40 in 1980 to the current 250 has increased the cost and security risk of complying with some provisions. They also say <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings since 1980, broadening prison officials' leeway to determine prison conditions, have made it clear that conditions at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> comply with the Constitution. The 1980 order is `` at best irrelevant to the dictates of the law, and at worst a dangerous and extravagant interference with professional prison management,'' Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Donhoff </PERSON> said in court papers. Lawyers for the prisoners say the state has no legal reason for violating the order, only a political motive to avoid appearing soft on convicted killers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Weigel </PERSON>, who signed the 1980 order, assigned the hearing to his former law clerk, attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON>, who acts as a monitor of the state's compliance with <PERSON> Weigel </PERSON>'s orders in several lawsuits over conditions at state prisons. <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON>, in a report filed before the hearing started last week, found apparent violations of various provisions, including requirements to furnish an adequate law library, allow condemned prisoners out of their cells for meals and other activities during the daytime, and provide a covered exercise yard. He ordered the state to show why it should not be held in contempt of court for violating <PERSON> Weigel </PERSON>'s order. The hearing began in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> federal court last week and was shifted across the bay to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> for the inmates' testimony.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to move cautiously in trying to use tax law changes to stem the current wave of leveraged buyouts. `` You should be aware that your committee's activities may influence a stock market that is skittish and nervous,'' <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> studies after the October 1987 stock market crash showed that one factor contributing to its severity was legislation then being considered by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to curtail some of the deductions on interest paid by companies to holders of high-yield junk bonds. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> admitted that the double taxation of dividends _ first as part of the 34 percent income tax on corporations and again when they are distributed to shareholders as personal income _ is helping drive the leveraged buyout or LBO phenomenon. But he said he opposed taxing the interest that leveraged companies pay on junk bonds as a way of equalizing the tax treatment between the two primary means for raising captital: debt or bonds and stock or equity. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, like <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> who testified before him on Tuesday, said the better alternative would be to allow companies to treat as a deductible expense the dividends they pay or to give shareholders a tax credit for the corporate income taxes paid by a company. But, also like <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, he added, `` I do not believe we can do that given our enormous deficit problem.'' In an LBO, an investment group borrows heavily in order to buy out stockholders and take over the company. Often LBOs are proposed by managers seeking to thwart a hostile takeover. The company's new owners either cut costs or sell off pieces of the company to pay back loans. Critics of the practice fear the high debt levels, in a recession, would endanger both the bought-out company and the banks and brokerage firms financing the buyout. Both the tax-writing Finance and Ways and Means committees are re-examining leveraged buyouts in the wake of the pending $ 25 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> LBO </ORGANIZATION> specialist <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the $ 13 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Phillip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> last year. Those were the two biggest of more than 300 leveraged buyouts totaling nearly $ 100 billion in 1988. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, D-Tex., the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, said the primary concern is the possibility the recent surge of leveraged buyouts `` has created a mountain of corporate debt that will make our next recession deeper and longer than it needs to be. While <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the goal is to balance the attractiveness of equity and debt financing that is clearly tilted to the debt side under current tax laws, but he acknowledged it is going to be difficult to find the right combination of `` carrots and sticks.''

The one-paragraph report did not elaborate. Nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and a Belgian are missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. American journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 42, Chief Middle East correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest-held of the captives. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. An-Nahar has been cautious in its hostage reporting and has not made unfulfilled predictions or reported developments which later turned out to be false. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been trying to improve political and trade ties with the West since last summer, when it agreed to a cease-fire in its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.

 Officials from <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and independent oil-producing nations huddled separately Wednesday to plot strategy for Thursday's joint meeting over cooperation in supporting crude oil prices Afterward, the independent group indicated support for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to limit production and stated both producer and consumer nations would be served by stabilizing prices A senior <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> source said separately that he was hopeful the cartel could reach agreement for output cuts by the independent producers, but said that was n't likely to happen immediately. `` Our unity is stronger now. Prices have strengthened and we are ready'' for a cooperative agreement, said the senior <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> source, who requested anonymity. `` This is the first step in a step-by-step move'' to push up oil prices, he said. A similar joint meeting was held last April, when six non-OPEC producers met with representatives of the 13-member <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> and suggested they jointly cut their exports by 5 percent. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> rejected that proposal. This time, some of the seven attending non-OPEC producers might offer to cut their collective production by 5 percent, without asking for reciprocal cuts from <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, non-OPEC sources have said this week. The independents likely will want <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> reassurance that the cartel would not increase its own production if they went ahead with their cuts. The spot price of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> Brent Blend, the most widely-traded international crude oil, was $ 16.55 a barrel late Wednesday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, up 54 cents from late Tuesday. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the March contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> jumped 58 cents Wednesday to settle at $ 18.12 a barrel, after closing 21 cents higher on Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> experts from <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> met for several hours Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Indonesian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. At a brief news conference after the meeting, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> director general <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> described the gathering as a preparatory meeting of cartel technicians. He said technicians for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and the non-OPEC nations would meet Thursday morning to exchange information `` and we will see the market together and then what we can do together.'' The groups planned to issue a joint statement afterward, <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said. The non-OPEC group issued a communique afterward saying that representatives of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> met with observers from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` The delegates unanimously share the desire to see the oil market stabilize, an issue they consider of importance to both consumers and producers of oil,'' the communique read. `` This shared responsibility was perceived in spite of the variety of outlooks represented at the meeting.'' `` The delegates were satisfied that the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> conference held in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> last November had produced very positive results and they expressed the hope that those efforts would be sustained throughout the first half of 1989,'' the communique read.

<HEAD>Study: Psychiatric Drugs Abused in Rest Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Powerful tranquilizers with potentially dangerous side effects are being widely given to elderly people in rest homes, often by untrained aides without medical supervision, a study concludes. Such drugs are available only through a doctor's prescription, but many patients continue to be given the drugs months or years after examination by a doctor, the study's principal author said Wednesday. `` It may well be that when they first started getting the stuff they needed it,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Avorn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` It may be that some people still need it.'' But without follow-up examinations, there is no assurance that the drugs are being used properly, he said. Drugs like Thorazine and Haldol, which are meant to treat psychotic patients, can cause a disfiguring and sometimes irreversible problem called tardive dyskinesia, in which patients develop uncontrollable facial twitches. <PERSON> Avorn </PERSON> found that use of the drugs is not limited to treatment of psychotics. `` Sometimes they are used as sedatives, and that's not a good idea, because they will have side effects that outweigh their advantages,'' <PERSON> Avorn </PERSON> said. Too high a dose of the drugs can increase confusion and lethargy, thereby raising the chances that patients will fall and injure themselves, <PERSON> Avorn </PERSON> said. `` If you over-sedate a person, you are quite likely to put them at risk of a fall that can lead to considerable disability or death,'' he said. Twenty percent of elderly people who fracture their hips, for example, will die within one year, <PERSON> Avorn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Avorn </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Soumerai </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, surveyed 55 rest homes in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. These are institutions for the care of elderly people not sick enough to be in nursing homes but too frail to live on their own, <PERSON> Avorn </PERSON> said. The researchers found that 55 percent of the 1,201 residents were taking at least one psychiatric drug, and 39 percent were taking so-called major tranquilizers such as Thorazine and Haldol. In a further study of 837 residents at 44 nursing homes, the researchers found that about half had apparently not seen a doctor for evaluation of their mental health for at least a year. One-third of the residents did poorly on standard tests of mental function. `` It certainly raises the question of whether the medication might contribute in part to this lack of ability,'' <PERSON> Avorn </PERSON> said. Six percent of the residents had moderate to severe cases of tardive dyskinesia. The findings will appear Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Slater </PERSON>, director of the geriatric research and training program at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Aging in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Avorn </PERSON>'s study `` is not surprising, but of course it's a concern.'' `` Places for the care of the institutionalized elderly are constrained by a lack of resources, so that most of the care comes from nonprofessionals,'' <PERSON> Slater </PERSON> said. `` The people who provide the care are often minimum-wage employees.'' <PERSON> Avorn </PERSON> said that although the survey was limited to rest homes in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, the findings are probably typical of what's happening elsewhere. `` We are pretty representative of this level of care around the country,'' he said. In December, <PERSON> Avorn </PERSON> and his colleagues reported on a similar misuse of mood altering drugs in nursing homes.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to change <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade rules that international panels say violate an agreement with other trading countries. `` If we want other nations to eliminate ... illegal trade barriers when we win before a panel, we must be equally prepared to change our actions and policies when we lose,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bello </PERSON>, general counsel to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative. She was testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on international trade `` We must show we're not a scofflaw,'' Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., agreed He is chairman of the subcommittee and a major force in trade policy. The accord is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, which has nearly 100 governments as members. The <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> organization sponsors the `` <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> round'' negotiations in which the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has been trying unsuccessfully for a long-term agreement on ending subsidies to farmers. These subsidies cost consumers and taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year. Ms. <PERSON> Bello </PERSON> said the rules she wants changed are more important than they seem because there are widespread doubts among other negotiators about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intentions. At issue in Tuesday's hearing was a tax on imports of petroleum and some petroleum products passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 to help finance a `` superfund'' for cleaning up toxic waste. The tax on imported products was 11.7 cents a barrel, 3.5 cents more than the tax on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production of the same items. In June 1987, an international panel ruled that the difference was a discrimination against other countries and a violation of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>. Other governments threatened to retaliate against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. To avoid that, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration offered to negotiate compensation with the countries affected. There have been talks with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the 12 countries represented by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, but no conclusion has been reached. The community estimates that the tax costs its member countries $ 26.6 million a year. Ms. <PERSON> Bello </PERSON> said it would be preferable to get rid of the differential. Also at issue is a `` user fee'' for work done by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, based on the value of products imported. Another international panel ruled that also was a violation of the accord, which says such fees should be based on actual cost to the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. According to <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> <PERSON> Krucoff </PERSON>, press officer for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, its members paid $ 22.2 million in such fees in 1987. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fee must be revised to tie it more closely to the actual cost of processing particular entries,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bello </PERSON> said. The program brought in $ 787 million last year, according to <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> User </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Soviets To Buy More Grain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been given the go-ahead to buy more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain than had been previous specified, including more quantities of wheat at subsidized prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday. In one action, the Soviets were told they can now buy up to 20 million metric tons of grain in the 1988-89 year, up from 16 million tons specified earlier. Purchases already total more than 12 million tons. The department also said the Soviets have bought another 150,000 tons of soybean meal, which has a potential current market value of about $ 36 million. Under a long-term grain agreement, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was originally limited to 12 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain a year, but that was increased to 16 million tons on Dec. 23. The agreement had expired last Sept. 30 but was later extended through Dec. 31, 1990. Officials said the increase for 1988-89 `` takes into account recent public confirmation by Soviet authorities'' that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s grain harvest last year was below expectations. Acting Undersecretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> also announced that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has been authorized an additional 2 million tons of wheat that it can buy under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. Earlier this week, for example, the department announced an <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> wheat sale to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of 635,000 tons, or about 23.3 million bushels. The subsidies shaved $ 23.05 per ton off the regular market price, or about 63 cents per bushel. A metric tons is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. The <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies. Sales of wheat and corn now total more than 11.6 million tons for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement which began last Oct. 1. That includes about 10.2 million tons of corn and 1.4 million tons of wheat. In addition, the Soviets have bought 450,000 tons of soybeans, 1.28 million tons of soybean meal, and 500,000 tons of grain sorghums. Under the agreement, each ton of soybeans or meal counts for two tons of grain. Only wheat is approved for sale to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> subsidy arrangement.

 The last of the homeless people staying at a baseball stadium are being moved into the first permanent shelter funded by the city, an official said Wednesday. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Maduro </PERSON> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> was opened in mid-December to homeless people, including newly arrived Central Americans. But the stadium is the spring home of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>, whose representatives have arrived to begin preparations for ticket sales starting Feb. 10. The city and <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> agreed to split the $ 175,000 cost of renovating <PERSON> Beckham </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> Annex </PERSON>, a former youth facility that has been converted into a 150-bed dormitory for the homeless. Mark Coats, assistant to the city coordinator of homeless projects, said the move would be completed by Thursday. The city had hoped to move the homeless sooner, but work at the annex was slower than expected. At its peak as a homeless shelter, the stadium housed 413 people a night. The Central Americans were placed by late last week in housing partly paid for with $ 20,000 in donations to the city and $ 76,000 raised by Spanish-language stations. The Roman Catholic archdiocese opened a 171-bed shelter, and about 150 beds already have been filled. But 150 homeless Americans remained at the stadium, meaning the annex probably would be full as soon as it opened, Coats said. <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s homeless number 8,700 in summer and 10,000 in winter, estimates <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who operates the <ORGANIZATION> Camillus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> shelter and soup kitchen for the Brothers of the Good Shepherd.

 Fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> subpoenaed former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON> for <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s upcoming trial in the Iran-Contra case, one of the congressmen confirmed Wednesday. Also, <PERSON> North </PERSON> has subpoenaed records from three <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panels that tried unsuccessfully during 1985-1986 to determine what action he was taking on the Contras' behalf. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> reply that sought to quash portions of the subpoenas complained that he sought `` the broadest imaginable range'' of documents. At a court hearing, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said the matter of subpoenaing two congressmen must be approached with `` some degree of accommodation'' and that `` we're not going to pull them off the floor'' of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to testify at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial. North attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> did n't identify the two congressmen. However, <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Okahoma </LOCATION> Democrat and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed in an interview that he and <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> had been subpoenaed by North. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., chaired the committee during 1985-86 and is no longer a member of the committee A hearing is scheduled for Friday to hear all objections to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s subpoenas, including those seeking testimony from former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Two House staff members also have been subpoenaed by <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said, and congressional sources identified them as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> employees. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> filed a 22-page motion seeking to quash large portions of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s request for documents from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committees on intelligence, foreign affairs and armed services. The filing said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> `` stands ready'' to provide all documents which are `` material and relevant for the trial'' which is scheduled to begin next Tuesday. Nort, according to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> filing, hopes to show that the committees in 1985 and 1986 already knew about his efforts on behalf of the Contras from other sources, making it irrelevant whether he misled or told the truth in responding to questions about his activities from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The former <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> aide `` asserts that what <PERSON> North </PERSON> was allegedly concealing in 1985-86 chiefly by false statements and document alteration and destruction <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committees knew from other sources,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> filing. North `` reasons that hence no crimes occurred, for what the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> knew, <PERSON> North </PERSON> could not conceal from it.'' North's `` dragnet subpoena'' is `` based on an amazing theory that failure'' to obstruct <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` is a defense to an obstruction charge,'' the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> filing concluded. North's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> document subpoenas require `` surrender of the broadest imaginable range of privileged documents,'' said the filing by <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> clerk. North is seeking everything the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committees have regarding providing support to the Contras by private benefactors, third countries, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s courier to the Contras <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> and co-defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, who <PERSON> North </PERSON> enlisted to run the resupply operation. North subpoenaed the whole set of records of the intelligence panel's probe of the Contra resupply operation, which began after a Contra resupply plane with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> crewman <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON> aboard was shot down in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in October 1986. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> also disclosed that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s attorneys at one point delivered to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel a subpoena for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as a whole, asking `` for records from the files of every member.'' North's attorneys were told that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel was n't authorized to accept service of such a subpoena. North issued two subpoenas Dec. 28, for the intelligence and foreign affairs committees, and issued two more subpoenas on Inauguration Day, to the armed services and foreign affairs panels, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> disclosed in its court filing. Four of the 12 criminal charges remaining against <PERSON> North </PERSON> are that in 1985 he concealed from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> his alleged efforts on behalf of the Contras to raise funds, arrange arms shipments or offer tactical advice. Another count says he concealed similar information at an August 1986 meeting in the White House Situation Room with members and staff of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committee. North is charged additionally with obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in November 1986 by altering, destroying and concealing documents on the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms shipments and aid to the Contras. Meanwhile, independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, in a court filing, supported the government's motion to quash <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s subpoena issued while <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was still president for any presidential documents concerning the arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and support for the Contras. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> also supported quashing a separate North subpoena to the executive office's custodian of records seeking videotapes and audio tapes of speeches by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or then-Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporting the Contras and documents on post-trip briefings for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the Contras. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s subpoenas for presidential documents are an attempt to `` delay the start of trial by requiring the Government to provide massive, unnecessary pretrial discovery.''

<HEAD>Army to Use Fewer Reservists In Cost-Cutting Move</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The army said Wednesday it is replacing reserve soldiers with infantry and paramilitary police to reduce the time Israelis must serve in the reserve and to cut the cost of controlling the Palestinian uprising. Since the uprising began more than 13 months ago, reserve duty has increased by about a third, and the army's recent get-tough policy in the occupied territories has come under increasing criticism by Jews and Arabs alike. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Wednesday, six Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and hospital officials said. Israeli and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said Jewish settlers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> invaded the Arab village of <LOCATION> Bidya </LOCATION> on Tuesday night to protest an injury to a 16-year-old settler from a stone and emulated leaders of the Palestinian uprising by issuing a warning leaflet. `` You must know that such things, if they continue, will hurt you, your property and your security,'' said leaflet No. 1 from the settlers in nearby Ariel. `` We are calling on you before it is too late and patience is lost.'' Gen. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barak </PERSON>, deputy chief of staff, spoke of the personnel changes at a news conference in which he was repeatedly asked about growing Palestinian casualties in the occupied territories with the introduction of a get-tough policy against stone-throwing protesters. <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> said mobilized infantry units already have been deployed throughout the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and now make up about 10 percent of the troops handling the revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. `` We are trying to make these extra units more effective, more mobile,'' <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> said. Regular soldiers also have been reinforced with paramilitary border police patrols, whose strength has been increased by about 50 percent in recent months, he said. He refused to discuss specific troop strength for security reasons, but some reports have said an average of 10,000 Israeli troops have been deployed in the territories on any given day. <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> said one aim of using the police units was to try to reduce the amount of reserve duty that Israelis have been asked to perform over the past 13 months. Reservists last year served an average of about 60 days, he said, greatly increasing defense spending and interfering with the reservists' lives. He said the goal was to cut this to between 42 and 44 days in the fiscal year starting April 1, or about the level it was before the uprising. The deployment goals for reservists reflect reports that the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> hopes to cut its spending for controlling the uprising from $ 222 million in the 16-months ending March 31 to about $ 124 million in the following 12 months. The army is facing growing criticism over its policies in territories occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Settlers have complained soldiers were not tough enough, and left-wing Israelis have questioned whether troops were not firing too freely. Some reserve soldiers also complained last week they were forced to beat Palestinians to keep order. Recent complaints have centered on new policies allowing soldiers to fire plastic bullets at Palestinians fleeing stone-throwing protests or blocking roads with stone barricades. <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> defended the use of plastic bullets, introduced by the army as less lethal than standard lead ammunition, but confirmed reports plastic bullets killed 47 Palestinians since they came into use in July. He said about a third of those deaths and most of the Palestinian casualties came as soldiers fired in a `` life-threatening situation,'' but he said some deaths were due to mistakes. According to hospital figures, 368 Palestinians have been killed since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987. Fifteen Israelis also have died. <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> gave slightly lower figures, saying 352 Palestinians were killed, including 289 who died from in army gunfire. He said at least 30 were killed by fellow Palestinians. He did not give other reasons, but there are some cases where Jewish settlers are being investigated for killing Palestinians. <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> said more than 40 Israeli civilians and about 300 soldiers have been wounded in the uprising. He said that 4,300 Palestinians have been wounded but did not explain the difference from a months-old figure listing at least 7,000 Palestinians injured.

 <PERSON> Zacharry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dacri </PERSON>, who lived only seven weeks before he was drowned in a bathtub and then dismembered, was buried Wednesday in a suburban cemetery. His 20-year-old mother, <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Dacri </PERSON>, is charged with murder and abuse of a corpse. Police said she told officers she killed her son Jan. 7 because she could n't cope with his constant crying. A court Tuesday rejected her request to be let out of jail long enough to attend the funeral. Her 22-year-old husband, <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Dacri </PERSON>, is free on bail on charges he helped his wife dispose of the child's remains. Mrs. <PERSON> Dacri </PERSON> first claimed <PERSON> Zacharry </PERSON> was kidnapped at a shopping mall, but then acknowledged the boy had been drowned and his dismembered body disposed of. Police recovered the boy's body from two creeks. The father was among about 50 relatives and friends at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, when the white-painted wood casket was to taken the altar for Mass. Burial was in the Our Lady of Grace Cemetery in nearby <LOCATION> Langhorne </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dacri </PERSON> did n't sit with his mother, <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, or stepfather but occupied a pew alone six rows behind them. During Mass he appeared to be sobbing. The <PERSON> Richardsons </PERSON>, who have custody of the Dacris' other child, opposed their daughter-in-law's presence at the funeral. Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> agreed Tuesday not to temporarily release her from the jail where she is being held without bail. He said the mother's presence would turn `` what ought to be a quiet and respectful burial of an infant into a circus atmosphere.'' The media was barred from the cemetery. Earlier, church officials summoned a police officer after two reporters disregarded a request to stay outside during the funeral. Also in church were Mrs. <PERSON> Dacri </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Essig </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peckville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and her sister and brother. They sat impassively.

 Legislation to set a uniform nationwide poll closing time during presidential elections was introduced Wednesday by Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash. The bill is intended to prevent early projections of election results while polls on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> are still open. Election officials in the West have complained that early network television projections of the winner in the presidential race discourages voters in their states from going to the polls. The lower turnout has affected the outcome of close local races, officials have said. `` After every presidential election, the need for this bill is increasingly apparent,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, adding that last year the networks began their `` quadrennial scramble'' to project a winner in the presidential race almost two hours before polls closed in the West. `` As the networks struggled to beat each other to the punch, they delivered a severe blow to our electoral process,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. The bill calls for the polls to close simultaneously across the country, at 7 p.m. <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> time, 8 p.m. Mountain, 9 p.m. Central and 10 p.m. Eastern. Poll closing times in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> would not be affected. Similar legislation was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last year, but was not acted on by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> during the rush to adjourn before the election.

 West German investigators are exploring leads that the giant <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> technology firm assisted in the construction of a chemical plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> by providing electronic control equipment and telephone gear, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government source said Wednesday. The offices of three West German companies and the homes of 12 people suspected of assisting <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in violation of export laws were searched Wednesday, authorities in <LOCATION> Offenburg </LOCATION> said. Only one of the firms, Imhausen-Chemie, was identified by a spokesman for the prosecutor's office. <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> has denied any wrongdoing. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the control equipment apparently was shipped to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> under an expired license while 10 tons of telephone equipment was mislabeled as being bound for the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> telephone exchange. He said some investigators believe <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION>' role in advancing the plant project could grow larger as the probe proceeds. <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON> said the Munich-based company had delivered switching and measuring equipment for a project in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, but denied any wrongdoing or involvement with a Libyan enterprise. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, said he had no comment. The investigation now is centered mostly on Imhausen-Chemie and its alleged role in constructing the plant at <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, some 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, and also on <ORGANIZATION> Intec </ORGANIZATION>, another West German firm that reportedly helped <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> convert transport planes into tankers to refuel French-built jets in midair so they could reach <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The idea was to bring the Western Wall in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, other Jewish holy places in the capital, and <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, the most populous city in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, within range, the source said. <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> and also <PERSON> Saltzgitter </PERSON>, a wholly state-owned company that reportedly supplied plans for the plant, are getting increased attention. <PERSON> Saltzgitter </PERSON> has denied its employees worked on the <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> factory. The West German government initially disputed findings by separate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and Dutch investigations that linked West German firms to the project, but subsequently acknowledged there was compelling evidence to support the allegations. Officials in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are conducting a criminal investigation to determine if Imhausen-Chemie and other companies illegally shipped arms, hazardous substances or components that can be used to produce them. The affair has deeply embarrassed the West German government. A former <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen-Chemie </ORGANIZATION> manager who had buried damaging documents is cooperating with the investigators, said the source. He described the ex-employee as a `` canary.'' <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has denied the plant was designed to produce chemical weapons and has offered to open it to international inspection. Former Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who led the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campaign to deny <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> useful technology, said before leaving office last week that the plant had not reached the point of production _ and might not get there if Western firms heeded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warnings. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> contends the plant is designed to eventually produce pharmaceuticals.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> launched an unarmed Minuteman III missile Wednesday that successfully reached its target in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> 4,200 miles away, officials said. The missile blasted off at 5:57 a.m. and splashed down as planned 30 minutes later in the Kwajalein Missile Range in the <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, said Capt. <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON>. The launch was the 473rd Strategic Air Command test launch of a Minuteman missile from this base 140 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The window for the launch, or the time during which the Western Test Range is secured and cleared of sea vessels and aircraft, began at 5 a.m. The flight was delayed 27 minutes by `` minor unexpected events,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Morey </PERSON> of the Vandenberg-based 1st Strategic Aerospace Command Division. He would not elaborate. <PERSON> Morey </PERSON> said the lift off was monitored on the ground by a crew from <ORGANIZATION> Malmstrom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, where the missile was stationed before being transferred to <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister is expected here Thursday to try again with Syrian officials to stop a nine-month war between the Shiite Moslem militias they sponsor in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Syrian-backed Amal and the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, supported by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, are fighting for supremacy among <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1 million Shiites, the largest sect in the war-ravaged nation. More than 500 people have been killed and 1,500 wounded since April. The latest round of battles has taken 172 lives since Dec. 31, and 337 people have been reported wounded. A truce was announced Wednesday morning under a `` preliminary'' peace agreement, but an hour-long battle broke the truce later in the day. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> would visit <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Thursday to make the deal final. He also was in the Syrian capital Tuesday. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> supported <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, in which a cease-fire was reached Aug. 20. But their interests compete in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> stations about 40,000 troops and has been the main power broker. Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, which means Party of God, reached the peace agreement during three days of negotiations in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> mediated by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. A Syrian Foreign Ministry statement issued Wednesday after night-long negotiations said the rival militias agreed to end their war in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> slums, but a battle with mortars and machine guns began later in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police said five militiamen were wounded in the hour-long battle in the shattered orchards of <LOCATION> Iklim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Tuffah </LOCATION>, or Apple province, which was a land of abundance before <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s sectarian civil war began in 1975. Several earlier <ORGANIZATION> Amal-Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> truces also have failed. Elsewhere in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> army and allied militiamen expelled 40 Lebanese men, women and children from its self-proclaimed `` security zone'' just north of the border, police reported. They said the expulsion from the Sunni Moslem village of Shibaa inside the zone occurred after inhabitants refused to cooperate with an Israeli-sponsored local administration. A police spokesman said 130 soldiers and militiamen, with 20 armored personnel carriers, surrounded Shibaa during the night. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said two 155mm howitzer shells landed at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force headquarters in the border town of <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION> but did not explode. He told reporters they were fired from around <LOCATION> Marjayoun </LOCATION>, headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the Israeli-backed militia that operates in the security zone. According to the Syrian statement, the peace agreement between Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> provided for an immediate cease-fire and an end to hostile propaganda campaigns by both sides. It said the militias would continue negotiations for a `` comprehensive reconciliation agreement.'' Syrianofficials would not comment on the cease-fire violation. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, the Iranian foreign minister, met in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Tuesday with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, Foreign Minster <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharaa </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, leader of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> seeks to create an Iranian-style Islamic republic in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but the more secular and nationalist <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> wants government in which Moslems would share power equally with the once-dominant Christians. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> advocates guerrilla attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> seeks only to get the Israelis out of the border zone. It opposes cross-border raids because they provoke retaliation against the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> population of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Official Blames Reactor Accident on Poor Supervision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An accident that caused several valves to rupture at a nuclear reactor in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> resulted in part from poor supervision and a neglect of safety procedures, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday. <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, acting assistant secretary for defense programs, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing the accident was disturbingly similar to an incident last August in which operators of another reactor at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> bypassed standard procedures in attempting to restart the reactor, causing a dangerous power surge. `` It does have some unfortunate parallels to the August incident when you talk about operator attitude,'' <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Department officials at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> said Wednesday it was too early to say whether the accident Sunday would delay a planned restart of the three-reactor complex. <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is the nation's only source of tritium, a perishable gas vital to the production of nuclear warheads The complex has produced no tritium since last spring, due to technical and safety problems. Department officials have said they hope to have the reactors running again by the end of 1989, although no firm target date has been set. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitchford </PERSON>, a department spokesman at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, said all testing, maintenance and other operations at the K reactor were halted after the accident and would remain on hold at least for a few more days. He said investigators would make a detailed assessment of the damage. <PERSON> Pitchford </PERSON> said preliminary indications were that this shutdown of reactor operations `` will not have any significant impact'' on the timetable for restarting the K reactor. The Pentagon has said production of tritium must be resumed before the end of the year to avoid a weakening of the nation's nuclear weapons program It has not said exactly when the tritium supply would reach a critical level. <PERSON> Pitchford </PERSON> said it appeared it would take `` a few weeks'' to complete the investigation of Sunday's accident. Department officials said the reactor operators were performing a test involving running water through the reactor's backup cooling system and monitoring the pressure in pipes. Operators were unaware that a valve had been left open after a similar test last week, and pressure did not rise to expected levels. In what <PERSON> Pitchford </PERSON> called a violation of standard procedures, the operators started another pump, causing pressure inside the pipes to rise suddenly. The valve that had been left open then slammed shut, causing a surge of pressure that damaged other valves. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> recalled that after the August incident, an extra reactor crew was added at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> so that one full complement could always be in training. `` That has n't helped'' improve safety procedures `` as we thought it would,'' he said. He added that if the damage from Sunday's accident turns out to be `` the worst case,'' it will have some effect on plans for restarting the reactor. `` We will not restart until we are satisfied with worker training and worker attitude,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, who has led congressional inquiries into problems at the nuclear weapons complex, told <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> the latest incident seemed to indicate that procedures to assure safety at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> had not improved since last summer. Meanwhile, governors from states with nuclear weapons plants urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday to commit more money to cleaning up radioactive and chemical pollution at government-owned bomb factories. `` As the governors of the states most affected, we implore you to take the initiative in working with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to establish cleanup as a national imperative,'' said a letter from Govs. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. `` As an urgent critical first step in this process we urge you to include substantially increased funding for waste cleanup and disposal work at -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- facilities in your fiscal year 1990 budget proposal,'' said the letter, delivered to the White House.

<HEAD>Official Says Accelerator Technology Not `Mature' Enough</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> has concluded that linear accelerator technology is not `` mature'' enough that accelerators rather than nuclear reactors can be used to produce a key ingredient for atomic weapons, a top department official said Wednesday. `` It is a giant step from where we are today to the kind of accelerator and size of accelerator we would need,'' <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, the department's acting assistant secretary for defense programs, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Scientists at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> national laboratories and the <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse-Hanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state have written that an accelerator could produce tritium more cheaply, quickly and safely than a nuclear reactor. Some of the scientists also believe that an accelerator could be used to change highly radioactive waste into less hazardous substances. Last July, the department recommended construction of two new nuclear reactors to produce tritium, one at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> complex in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, and the other at the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. The reactors, which would cost an estimated $ 6.8 billion and take at least 10 years to finish, would replace the aging tritium-producing reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The existing <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors have been plagued by safety problems and are currently shut down. `` We have looked at accelerator technology,'' <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> told the committee. `` It is not mature technology. We would continue to pursue the accelerator technology, but at the moment it is not as mature as fission reactors.'' The department provided $ 300,000 in funding for the initial accelerator research, but no money was provided to continue the research in the current fiscal year. Also on Wednesday, an aide to Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., said the senator may ask the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to review the accelerator proposal An accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash into a target, in this case lithium clad in aluminum. The resulting collision produces tritium, a radioactive gas used in nuclear weapons. The accelerator would take massive amounts of electricity to operate, roughly the output of an entire nuclear power plant. The scientists who have studied the accelerator have suggested the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state as one possible site. The <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> has the cheapest electric rates in the nation and the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it would have enough electricity available in the 1990s to power an accelerator.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> was buried on Wednesday inside a museum filled with his surrealistic artwork next to a shower-equipped <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> and a painting of a woman's torso. Thousands watched as four workers wearing Dali-designed uniforms carried his coffin through the arched door of the Theater-Museum Dali, a converted municipal theater where the artist, then 14, held his first exhibition 71 years ago. <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> was eulogized earlier Wednesday in the Sant Pere Roman Catholic parish church, then carried across a square bearing his name to the museum he founded in the city where he was born. After weaving past <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s `` Rainy Taxi'' _ a 1938 Cadillac with a coin-operated interior shower system _ pallbearers helped lower the black lacquered coffin into a marble-lined hole that was covered with a light gray slab of stone. A giant painting of a woman's nude torso with an image on its stomach of a gaping doorway topped by an olive tree looked down from the wall behind the coffin. On one side was a white plaster group sculpture of an orchestra and on was `` <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Dali </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vision </LOCATION>,'' a giant painting of <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s late wife, <PERSON> Gala </PERSON>, that turns into a portrait of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> when viewed from a distance The funeral service and burial were broadcast live on Spanish national television. `` Since he was an infant, he searched for beauty,'' Rev. <PERSON> Narciso </PERSON> <PERSON> Costabella </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>. `` Salvador, now that you have found authentic beauty in which you can revel forever, we wish you perfect rest and peace.'' Police said more than 20,000 people visited the <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s Galatea Tower residence, where his body lay in state for 31 hours. The painter died in <LOCATION> Figueras </LOCATION> on Monday, leaving an estate estimated at $ 87.7 million by some accounts. <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s will reportedly divides his estate among the governments of <PERSON> Figueras </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Catalonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Under Spanish law, it can not be read until 15 days after his death. Funeral mourners included one of <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s few living relatives, his cousin <PERSON> Montserrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>, who sat in the front row along with longtime <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> collaborators, including painter <PERSON> Antoni </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitxot </PERSON>, French archivist and <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s principal merchant <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Descharnes </PERSON> and attorney <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenech </PERSON>. Across the aisle sat Spanish Culture Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Semprun </PERSON>, Catalonian regional government president <PERSON> Jordi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pujol </PERSON> and Figueras Mayor <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorca </PERSON>. The owners of the Dali Museum in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> and Italian collector <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Alboretto </PERSON> also attended the funeral. His death has left a dispute over the reproduction rights to his artwork. <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>, who owns the largest private <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> collection outside <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, said earlier he would not discuss legal issues until after the mourning period. `` I'm here because of a 45-year-old friendship, to pay my respects to a dear friend and that's all,'' he said. Alboretto, who owns more than 500 <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> works, said he had prepared legal action against <PERSON> Decharnes </PERSON>, who administers <ORGANIZATION> Demart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arte </ORGANIZATION>, an Amsterdam-based company that has reproduction rights for <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s work through 2004. A founder of the surrealist movement in the 1930s, <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> was the last of an outstanding generation of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> painters that included <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miro </PERSON>. After living in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> returned for good to <LOCATION> Catalonia </LOCATION> in 1948. In later years he was known as much for his outrageous personality and theatrical interviews as for his paintings. He went into seclusion after his wife, manager and muse <PERSON> Gala </PERSON> died in 1982. He had a history of heart problems and had been confined to a wheelchair and fed through a tube since he suffered burns in a 1984 fire. <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> was admitted to <LOCATION> Figueras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on Monday because of severe heart trouble aggravated by pneumonia. It was his third trip to the hospital since late November.

 Nearly a quarter of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsored legislation Wednesday that would reject a proposed 50 percent congressional pay raise, and would roll back the increase if the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lets it become law by ducking a vote. The senators, 10 Democrats and 13 Republicans, made clear they wanted to turn up pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which appears headed toward allowing the increase to become law automatically. Sens. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, chief sponsors of the legislation, said the rollback feature would keep pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> even if the raise becomes law through <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> inaction. If the increase takes effect, <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> opponents of the raise could try again and again to attach a rollback to crucial legislation. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed increasing rank-and-file congressional salaries from $ 89,500 a year to $ 135,000, a raise that becomes law Feb. 8 unless both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote to stop it. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, has promised a vote on rejecting the raise before the deadline, but <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders have expressed no interest in allowing such a vote. Until now, critics of the raise have centered on stopping the increase by the deadline. The Pressler-Grassley bill, and comments by lawmakers in both houses Wednesday, have raise the possibility of action after the deadline to reduce the raise. Senators joining <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> in sponsoring the bill are <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, D-Nev.; <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill.; <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, R-Wis.; <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan.; <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>,; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Nev </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, R-Ind; <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn.; <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich.; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>, D-Ala. and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told reporters: `` I favor a comprehensive approach that includes enactment the ethics bill the president vetoed, campaign finance reform, a ban on honoraria and enactment of compensation to offset the loss He said the package could not be pulled together before the automatic trigger for the raise. The ethics bill, vetoed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and introduced again Wednesday by <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, would restrict lobbying by former members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, their staffs and top executive branch officials. Campaign finance reform would impose limits on campaign spending. Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version of the ethics bill, said he believed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also would address the pay raise as part of a reform package after the increase went into effect `` There should be a vote scheduled, and I think will be this spring,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he favors a package that includes the post-employment ethics bill, elimination of honoraria, and a $ 27,000 pay raise that would be a tradeoff for the honoraria loss in the House. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s plan, however, likely would be unpopular with senators, who can keep $ 35,800 in honoraria compared with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> cap of $ 26,850. Senators would therefore lose more in honoraria than they would gain in a raise. The proposal emphasized the strains between the two houses in the pay raise controversy. House members do n't like the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s higher honoraria figure. Senators are angry that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has refused to vote on pay raises before they automatically become law. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said many senators `` would like to leave the honoraria on'' and asked why the Pressler-Grassley bill did not include an honoraria ban along with the pay raise rollback. <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members resent the higher <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> honoraria `` without a doubt'' because `` most senators get some honoraria. Most House members do n't get any.'' The Pressler-Grassley bill is in three parts. The first feature would would disapprove the raise, not only for lawmakers but also a proposed 50 percent increase for top executive branch officials and federal judges. This action would only be meaningful if the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> followed suit. The second part, effective if the raise becomes law, would roll back congressional and executive branch salaries to levels of last Jan. 1. Judges would still get their raise because the Constitution prohibits reducing their salaries. The third element would require that all future pay raises have a recorded vote.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration Wednesday to move quickly in its <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts and persuade <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to take part in peace talks. `` We hope the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration will contribute in pressuring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to bow to the voice of peace,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said, appealing for worldwide backing for his peace initiative. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> wants the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to have equal footing with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in peace negotiations, a demand <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has refused. `` The present year is important for such an American decision after <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken over the presidency, and before <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is taken up with other international issues,'' he said. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was addressing a news conference in <LOCATION> Muscat </LOCATION> before leaving after a three-day visit, his first ever to <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. He has been enlisting the efforts of <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Qaboos </PERSON> in his quest for wide-scale diplomatic backing for the peace initiative. `` Peace is not up to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> but up to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> decision lies in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and not in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said in other interviews while in <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. `` The question now is whether the international community will force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to respond to peace or not,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. `` Will the world leave the powder keg in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> aflame because of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> intransigeance?'' More than 360 Palestinians have died in the 13-month-old Palestinian uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war.

In Palestinian language this means a referendum in which these inhabitants would decide whether to be an independent state, or to confederate with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a pre-inauguration interview, recommended confederation as the basis for a Palestinian settlement. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is about to resume formal sessions of the dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration initiated in December after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> explicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renounced terrorism. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhabi </PERSON>'s state-run newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> referred to an informal meeting in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> on Monday between <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

 Federal investigators said they can not determine whether politics was behind private detectives who shadowed Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, in 1986 and have closed the books on the case, according to documents released Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel said it ca n't sort out whether the detectives were hired to influence the 1986 election or were only looking into the lobbying activities of <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>, who represented Canadian timber interests <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> alleged that the detectives were trying to dig up information for a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer, <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON>, who is a friend of former Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, R-N.D. At the time, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> viewed <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> as a potential rival in his race for re-election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> said he was disappointed but not surprised at the commission's decision to drop the case. `` Even a blind hog can find an acorn now and then, but the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> has been consistently unwilling to investigate these things,'' <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is a political body which seems to have a political antenna in these cases which is always out.'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, who denied any involvement in the matter, said the commission's decision was a vindication, although he acknowledged that political fallout from the incident probably contributed to his losing the election. `` The original complaint against our campaign committee was politically motivated and totally without substance,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. That complaint was filed one week before the 1986 election by <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, who went on to win a narrow victory over Andrews. The complaint originally was against <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' re-election committee, the state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the private detective agency and a handful of lawyers. The commission decided to drop the investigation last fall, but that decision and the case record remained sealed until Wednesday. However, the central issue remained unresolved. `` There is conflicting evidence as to whether the activity in question was undertaken for the purpose of influencing a federal election,'' the commission's general counsel wrote. Rand, who told the commission he was working on behalf of <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman from <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, hired two other lawyers, one of whom hired a <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, private detective agency to gather information on <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it had begun legal proceedings to suspend a top contracting official who has been implicated in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> fraud investigation. The service said Dr. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, the deputy for tactical systems in the office of the assistant secretary for acquisition, had been served on Tuesday with a `` Notice of Proposed Indefinite Suspension.'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> has seven days to contest the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> personnel action. `` This action is based primarily on an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> affidavit which became available to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 28,'' the service said in a prepared statement. `` The action is based on a reasonable cause to believe that he has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment can be imposed.'' If an indefinite suspension is imposed, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> would be forced into a non-pay status `` for an indefinite period of time, penking resolution of the criminal process.'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> is currently suspended from his job but is drawing pay. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, unlike one <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> employee who was suspended earlier this month, has not been indicted by the federal grand jury that is conducting the investigation. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> was named in a government affadavit filed by prosecutors investigating bribery and corruption in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 150-billion-a-year procurement business The affadavit, based on telephone taps, showed by <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> used his official position to help consultant <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> or his clients in exchange for payments and other gratuities. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> has been indicted by a federal grand jury in the Pentagon case. The affadavit that names <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> cites an example of <ORGANIZATION> Cubic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, a client of <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>'s and a maker of shells that house electronic gear, called pods. Sometime before April 1, <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> to award an unidentified pod contract to Cubic on a sole source basis so that Cubic would be the only supplied, the ducment said. In a tapped phone conversation on May 15, 1987, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> told <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> that he would n't award the contract to Cubic as a sole source. But he said he planned to have the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> issue the request for proposal with a required delivery scheduled that Cubic's competitor could n't meet, the affidavit says. `` <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> assured <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> that by doing it this way, the procurement would appear to have been completed when, in actuality, Cubic would be guaranteed the award of the contract,'' the document said.

<TEXT>
 A 9-inch statuette of the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> that a police official put on his desk sparked a dispute with his deskmate that has spiraled into a debate on the division between church and state, authorities said Wednesday. The small-scale religious war erupted last year between Lt. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Begley </PERSON> and his supervisor, Capt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, when <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> placed the pale yellow plastic <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> on their desk. The officers, who were commander and second-in-command on the evening shift, began trading insults and jibes as the argument escalated last fall. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> alleged that <PERSON> Begley </PERSON> shrouded the religious icon in newspaper whenever <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> stepped out for a meal, and ordered him never to touch the statue. `` I never touched it,'' responded <PERSON> Begley </PERSON>. `` I just put the cup over it.'' The spat came to an abrupt conclusion in November when Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollow </PERSON> transferred <PERSON> Begley </PERSON> to dayside detective duties. Hollow has said the transfer had nothing to do with the religious dispute. On Tuesday, a state arbitrator heard <PERSON> Begley </PERSON>'s claim that the transfer, which he says will cost him thousands of dollars a year, was indeed religiously motivated and was improper. Three more hearings are scheduled through March. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, a factory city of about 78,000, has seven Roman Catholic churches and a police force of 180 officers. `` I'm as good a Roman Catholic as anybody, but that statue has no place on a police captain's desk,'' <PERSON> Begley </PERSON> said. `` We have Catholics, Protestants, Jews and I'm sure a few Moslems in this department. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> has no right to push his religion on other people. He should not be flaunting it.'' Calls to <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>'s office Wednesday evening were an answered by an officer who said that department employees had been ordered not to discuss the case with the news media. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, said the group had not been asked to become involved in <PERSON> Begley </PERSON>'s case but said it raised important issues. `` -LRB- We -RRB- are often concerned when government officials in a position of authority use displays of religious objects in a way that might suggest to the public or to employees that there is a particular religion that is favored by the agency,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. `` Such a symbolic link between church and state raises issues under the establishment clause of the First Amendment.'' <PERSON> Begley </PERSON> claims the transfer cost him $ 45,000 in annual pay because by working days he can no longer accept extra assignments for traffic control on road construction projects. Department officials had little comment on the case Wednesday. `` It should never have left the in-house stage,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, Hollow's spokesman. `` The department certainly did n't plan to go public with it.''

 Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> on Wednesday rejected proposals for an international peacekeeping force in his country and asked other nations to stop supporting guerrillas seeking to topple his government. Cambodian guerrillas, meanwhile, demanded that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> come up with a timetable for withdrawing its occupation forces from the country. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> had a `` frank discussion'' with <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON> and other Thai leaders on Wednesday, said <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> government spokesman <PERSON> Suvit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yodmani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yodmani </PERSON> stressed the two-hour talk did not constitute Thai recognition of the Vietnam-backed government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> `` just wants to get to know <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> because <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> later on most likely will be involved in a coalition government, hopefully when there is peace'' in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Suvit </PERSON> told reporters. He said both sides agreed that all warring Cambodian factions must attend the second session of Cambodian peace talks scheduled Feb. 19-21 in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. Participants in the first session in July included <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, the warring parties in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and the members of the non-communist <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` The conclusion is that up to now, anyway, -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> -RRB- would like <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to try to get the four sides together and to face one another and talk frankly,'' said <PERSON> Suvit </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s government and the three parties in the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance coalition <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1978 and toppled the brutal regime of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, who killed hundreds of thousands of people during their three-year rule. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has shunned the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government since then and has backed the three-party guerrilla coalition fighting Vietnamese and <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government troops. Before meeting with <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> told reporters that he rjected an international peacekeeping force for <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and also opposed other parts of the peace proposal by guerrilla coalition leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> also reiterated calls for a cessation of all military aid to <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance groups opposed to his government. He said <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s proposals would lead to the return to power of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, one of the parties in the guerrilla coalition. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> also said he was ready to discuss with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the question of Americans missing in action in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war, saying the discussions could take place in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which lists 83 Americans as missing in action in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, also does not recognize the <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> government. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said it will withdraw by 1990 but said it may pull its forces from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by September if a political solution can be achieved. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted Cambodian guerrillas as demanding a specific timetable for a Vietnamese withdrawal. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted the guerrillas<ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kampuchea </ORGANIZATION> as saying <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s withdrawal should take place under international supervision. The guerrillas' main international sponsor, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, has made a similar demand. East European sources said a timetable was discussed during meetings last week in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> between Vietnamese Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Dinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Nho </PERSON> <PERSON> Liem </PERSON> and Chinese officials. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> later said the two sides reached some agreements, but did not say if those included an agreement on a timetable. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> earlier called <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s statement that it could pull out by September `` a step forward.''

 To bystanders, it looked as if the contestants were trying to fish from the third-floor balcony of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. In fact, the students and teachers were competing in an experiment that could alter how spacecraft dock in outer space. The competition's long-range goal was to devise a cheaper, more effective method of linking the space shuttle with the space station. Present space shuttle docking plans are expensive and time-consuming, said <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Flotow </PERSON>. The simulated design contest was sponsored by <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Flotow </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The $ 500 first prize and a possible job with the company was offered to the competitor who completed the docking maneuver in the shortest time. The experiment involved dropping a tether line from a third-floor balcony in the MIT lobby, or the `` space station,'' and trying to connect it with the `` space shuttle'' on the floor below, fashioned from a garbage can and contestant-made nose cones. The trick was linking the tether to the space shuttle as rapidly as possible without risking hard impact. But the link had to be strong enough to lift the simulated space station off the floor. `` This idea has been drifting around for years,'' said <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Flotow </PERSON>, an assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>. `` But the aerospace business is the most conservative around. They do n't always want to try new things, even if there are considerable benefits.'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Flotow </PERSON> said several aerospace companies had expressed interest in seeing the winning design. Currently, the plans for a shuttle-space station docking call for what is termed metal-to-metal mating, which requires hours of precision flying to dock a relatively small payload. Since the cost of docking is estimated to be about $ 100,000 per second, substantial savings can result from finding a faster procedure, von <PERSON> Flotow </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Flotow </PERSON> said docking would require less fuel if a soft device on a miles-long tether were dropped from the orbiting space station to dock remotely with the space shuttle's payload at a sub-orbital altitude. He said several of the designs attempted Wednesday could work in space, where tether lines would be required to lift 6,600 pounds of weight. Four teams of contestants competed in the two-hour experiment. The winner, <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> graduate student <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Zerweckh </PERSON>, used a fishnet attached to the tether line to grasp a nose cone made of foam rubber. His best time was 9.9 seconds. <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ham </PERSON>, the only faculty member to compete, lowered two balloons and hooked them to cylindrical wires attached to the nose cone in a 19-second docking maneuver. To ensure that the simulated docking mechanisms would not damage a space shuttle, von <PERSON> Flotow </PERSON> tested each of the entries by dropping them on an egg and making sure they did not break it. `` It's something you can create and develop and at the same time it may prove really useful some day,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> mechanical engineer who was on the only non-MIT participant in the contest.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> unanimously confirmed <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as secretary of state Wednesday as Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> pledged to cooperate with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration while pursuing a Democratic agenda of improvements in the minimum wage, housing, health care and the environment. The Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also confirmed <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as Labor Secretary and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> as Budget Director without a dissenting vote. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, in a speech that seemed crafted as a response to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaugural address, said he looked forward to `` true bipartisanship'' on foreign policy. He said that meant the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> must commit itself to `` full, timely and meaningful consultation'' with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The first votes were anything but contentious. The roll call was 99-0 to confirm <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who served as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary and White House chief of staff under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and was President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager last year. He was sworn into office minutes later, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the wife of Senate GOP Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, also won approval on a 99-0 vote. She is a former Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> who resigned her post to help her husband's unsuccessful 1988 presidential campaign. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s confirmation roll call was 99-0, as well. He is a former top aide to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and will be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s point man in the drive to reduce the federal deficit. In all three instances, Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>, was the only senator who did n't vote. In the busiest day so far of the new, 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, committees also held confirmation hearings for several <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> appointees. Among them was Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, who said `` there is a need for reform'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and pledged to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to achieve it. Nearly a quarter of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsored legislation to block the $ 45,000 proposed congressional pay raise scheduled to take effect on Feb. 8. The proposal would roll back the increase if, as expected, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lets it become law without a vote. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration worked behind the scenes to defuse controversy over one Cabinet appointment. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, named to head the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, met privately with anti-abortion senators and apparently persuaded them he is committed enough to their cause to win their support for confirmation. `` Dr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> believes in his heart that the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision should be overturned,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, referring to the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that legalized abortion. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> had upset many conservative senators when he was quoted by another senator as saying he did not favor overturning the ruling. Baker, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> were the first <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appointees to face confirmation votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and Education Secretary <PERSON> Laurio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> are holdover appointments from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and did not require confirmation. The House was not in session, but inside the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber, speeches by <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> were followed by the introduction of legislation for the first time this year. The bills ranged from a measure to block the proposed $ 45,000 pay raise for lawmakers _ or repeal it if it takes effect on Feb. 7 _ to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s proposal for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitition. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., filed legislation to raise the minimum wage gradually from $ 3.35 to $ 4.55 an hour and Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, filed ethics legislation that was approved last year but vetoed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who spoke a few moments after <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, pledged bipartisanship and added it was the intention of the Republicans to `` support and further the cause of our new Republican president.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, in a speech that seemed drafted to reply to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaugural address of last week, said the president had `` put his hand out to me and the speaker of the house I now extend mine to him.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, `` We enter a new era. The New Deal and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reaction to it are over. We face new circumstances.'' He said his objectives were to reestablish a bipartisan foreign policy while also establishing a new social contract at home `` that defines not only what our country will do for our citizens but what our citizens will do for our country.'' The <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrat cautioned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that bipartisanship on foreign policy required `` full, timely, and meaningful consultation with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' on the part of the new administration. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> added that serious consultation `` will not prevent differences between the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president. There have always been such differences,. There always will be.'' His speech carried slightly more of a challenge to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on domestic issues. `` We look forward to receiving the president's budget proposals,'' he said, adding that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would work with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` to achieve a bipartisan budget reduction'' that is `` fair, credible and based on realistic economic projections.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said his speech was not designed as a detailed agenda for the year, but he did go into some detail. He said Democrats would seek legislation to deal with the homeless, health care and increased research and development. He called for full funding for a drug bill approved a year ago, improvements in the Clean Air Act and said, `` We will raise the minimum wage to a rate that will help those who depend on it.'' He also said he favors legislation to establish a program of voluntary national service. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> pledged to seek enactment of a comprehensive package of ethics legislation, including laws restricting lobbying activities of former members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a campaign finance bill and a ban on speaking and appearance fees received by senators and representatives. He did not say so in his speech, but he told reporters beforehand he favors a pay raise for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as part of the ethics package. The proposed $ 45,000 pay raise has become the most controversial issue of the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and opponents introduced legislation during the day to block it, or, in the event it takes effect, to repeal it. Their measure is designed to thwart apparent plans by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to prevent a vote on the pay raise until it takes effect automatically in two weeks. Lawmakers' salaries are to rise from just over $ 89,000 to $ 135,000, an increase of 50 percent. Federal judges and some political appointees would also receive increases.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> voiced reservations Wednesday about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> participation in a human rights conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1991, saying `` we need to look for peformance'' by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In his first interview as president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also hinted he will stop in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after visiting <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> next month. `` Stay tuned,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, discussing the possibility of going to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` We may have something on that'' soon, he added. Later, as he left the Oval Office for the night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked again if he was going to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` No, just going home,'' he quippped. In the interview, the president also said he hoped the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would not `` move so strongly against fear of inflation that we impede growth.'' Pointing to rising prices on Wall Street, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` There's no signals out there in the markets that this economy is in real trouble.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to say how long his pledge against raising taxes would apply. `` I'm not thinking beyond anything other than to say I will not raise taxes and I've got to stay with that approach. ... I really feel strong on that particular point, and I have n't thought beyond one year ... or anything of that nature.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> discussed domestic and foreign policy subjects in a 12-minute interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, and a text of his comments was released to the press. It was the first episode in what White House officials say will be a series of experiments to make <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> available to the media in various forums. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks about the human rights conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> echoed reservations voiced by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> during his confirmation hearings to be secretary of state. In the final days of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to the staging of a human rights conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Asked about going ahead with the conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I think that we need to look for performance -LRB- on human rights -RRB-, and there will be time in which to see performance in that regard. ... There has been definite improvement in some ways there. `` But let's see what develops as we move towards that conference date,'' he said. Later, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not backing away from its commitment. He said `` the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is only two days old and they want time to make our own analysis. ... `` But President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> certainly agrees with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ he was a part of that administration _ that considerable progress on human rights has been made in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'' came to power, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` But that's not to say there is n't room for new analysis.'' On other subjects, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: _ The administration is considering imposing a fee on customers of savings and loan institutions to help the federal government rescue the troubled S & amp; L industry `` I'm not going to say what I'm going to do but that is one option,'' he said. _ He is not considering dropping Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> as his candidate to head the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> despite questions about <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s position on abortion <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that in his conversations with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, `` he has supported my position 100 percent.'' _ He favors `` prudent development'' by oil companies in a vast Arctic national wildlife refuge that environmentalists are trying to protect _ He is not trying to do things differently than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` but it's important to me to do it my way _ It is uncertain how much money will be available for the war against illegal drugs but that `` the elimination of drugs is going to stem from vigorous changes in our society's approach to narcotics It's going to be successful only if our education is successful.'' In what will be his first foreign trip, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is is scheduled to go to <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> on Feb. 10 to meet with Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has said he will attend the Feb. 24 funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and there had been speculation he would go on to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and perhaps <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> afterward.

 Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is giving up the chairmanship of the panel's surface transportation subcommittee after his colleagues objected to his retaining both posts, <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> sources said Wednesday As a result, a three-way swap of subcommittee chairmanships has been worked out by lawmakers in which <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, D-Calif., would take charge of the committee's weaker and less visible investigations and oversight subcommittee Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., who has chaired the investigations panel, would instead head the committee's aviation subcommittee And Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., the current aviation chairman, would chair surface transportation <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 75, became chairman after his predecessor, Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, died after a heart attack last March. He has remained relatively obscure in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> despite a 20-year <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> career, in contrast to the more colorful and outgoing <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. According to three sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> wanted to continue as chairman of the full committee and the surface subcommittee. But other panel members, citing a long-standing committee tradition, argued that the committee chairman should not also chair a subcommittee. The lawmakers' objections also reflected unhappiness by some of the panel's younger members that subcommittee chairmanships are not opening up for new people, the sources said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> finally agreed to give up the surface panel, which controls billions of dollars in highway and mass transit projects and is the most sought-after subcommittee, in exchange for the investigations chairmanship. The investigations subcommittee does not initiate legislation, but it does conduct inquiries into various subjects. The swaps are all subject to approval by the committee's 31 Democrats, who will vote on the jobs on Feb. 1. <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON> issued a statement Wednesday saying he would seek the surface transportation job. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Smallen </PERSON>, asked about the three-way swap, said, `` I have no comment on that.''

<HEAD>Mudslide, With a Roar Like Thunder, Obliterates Tadzhik Villages</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet Quake, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SHARORA, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It moved as fast as a running man, and with enormous force. Looming black against the predawn sky, the mudslide sounded like thunder, or rocks being crushed into dust, survivors recall. Unleashed by an earthquake, the moving wall of mud, 50 feet high in places, crashed down on this hillside peasant settlement in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION> on Monday. It buried one-story mud-brick and prefabricated concrete homes and killed 207 villagers, most of them in their sleep. It left a silent, moonlike landscape of rolling, moist earth and no signs of life, except for white roofs that peeked through the grime or scraps of brightly colored cloth carried across it by a morning breeze from the hills. In house No. 1 at <PERSON> Sharora </PERSON>'s dairy farm, herdsman <PERSON> Saifulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Khodzharayev </PERSON>, 30, and seven members of his family were buried alive and suffocated after the earthquake, measuring 5.4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, dislodged the earth softened by thawing snow. They were among about 270 confirmed dead. The family's lone survivor was <PERSON> Khodzharayev </PERSON>'s 6-day-old baby girl, who had not yet been given a name. She was held by her father aloft at arm's length, and escaped the deadly torrent of wet, sticky clay, said <PERSON> Kholmurod </PERSON> <PERSON> Barotov </PERSON>, 17, a bakery worker. <PERSON> Barotov </PERSON> said his mother, the infant's aunt, had gone to spend the night at her house farther up the hill to help her sister take care of the newborn. That gesture probably cost <PERSON> Safarmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Barotov </PERSON> her life. Her teen-age son survived because he had been hospitalized outside of <LOCATION> Sharora </LOCATION> for a stomach ailment, he told Moscow-based reporters brought in by bus and helicopter Wednesday to view the disaster scene. For this more than 300-year-old settlement, the end came in seconds. The mudslide covered much of <LOCATION> Sharora </LOCATION> with a 300-yard-wide chocolate-colored earthen slather. `` It was like a bomb had exploded on top of our heads, or a thunderstorm had broke'' said <PERSON> Kibo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakhikov </PERSON>, 27, a policeman. Roused by the quake, he made it into the street in time to see an inky black mass tumbling down onto the village from the hills above. Two days after the disaster in this remote rural area about 1,800 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, bulldozers, cranes and dumptrucks worked to free <PERSON> Sharora </PERSON>'s streets of crumbled brick, broken pieces of undulated roofing, twisted trees and mud. A group of five women, dressed in the flowing robes and shawls common to this area north of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, shuffled weeping past wrecked and ruined homes, holding tightly to each other. Since custom in this mostly Moslem republic is not to attempt to recover the bodies of people buried alive, this village, whose name means `` spark'' in the Tadzhik language, will be fenced off and turned into a common grave, complete with a memorial for those who died. Two families, however, have insisted on searching for the bodies of loved ones, regional <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Khusayin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasymov </PERSON> said, and a dozen policeman and villagers, wielding shovels and hoes and assisted by an excavator, cut into the dense earth Wednesday morning in search of more dead. On the lip of the crater overlooking the site, <PERSON> Khusnia </PERSON> <PERSON> Khiromov </PERSON>, shawled in black and weeping, watched the men slowly work down through the mud to the shambles of the house where 11 people, six of them her relatives, had been buried. Another relation, a middle-age man who covered his face with a handkerchief, wailed loudly as he stood behind the digging men. In the mass of drying mud, the diggers sighted a sofa cushion covered with a striped blanket and some hair, which they took for the sign of a body. They unfurled a bright pink bath towel, making ready to cover yet another victim. In <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION>, it is not considered proper to reveal the dead to strangers. South of <LOCATION> Sharora </LOCATION>, on the other side of the rolling Urtabuz hills, mud ran like coffee-colored lava and fouled 370 acres of land tilled by the Karl Marx Collective Farm. In the farm's settlement of Okuli-Poyen, two miles down the other side of the hill, villagers were awakened Monday by an approaching roar that <PERSON> Esnali </PERSON> <PERSON> Matkamilov </PERSON>, 66, a retired mechanic, said sounded like a rock-crushing machine. The surging, advancing mud moved more slowly, taking at least 1 -LCB- hours to reach the village. It felled trees and 32 homes in its path but gave time enough to evaculate Okuli-Poyen, and not a single resident died. `` At the sound, I jumped into my shorts, ran out of the house and then to the next village,'' <PERSON> Matkamilov </PERSON> said. Other villagers said they fled with their families in trucks and cars. In <LOCATION> Okuli-Bolo </LOCATION>, a village to the west of <LOCATION> Sharora </LOCATION> and near the quake's epicenter, 67 people died when all 88 whitewashed dwellings in the settlement were flattened by the quake. Many were built only of dried clay and straw, and they crumbled into bits.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has blasted as `` jury tampering'' the attempts by two conservative groups to lobby a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member of the ethics panel in the case of House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` The brazen effort is closely akin to jury tampering in a court of law,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleagues. `` This clearly amounts to a flagrant politicization of a process that was specifically created to be above partisan politics.'' The letter was evidence of growing partisan tensions as the <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> nears the end of its seven-month probe of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and the time when its 12 members _ six Democrats and six Republicans _ must vote on the speaker's guilt or innocence. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is accused in a six-count resolution of abusing his office for financial gain and improperly intervening with federal regulators on behalf of constituents. The controversy began last month when a conservative newsletter published a brief bit of speculation that the ethics panel would ultimately avoid a 6-6 tie vote on the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> case because committee member Rep. <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Pashayan </PERSON>, R-Calif., would side with the Democrats to exonerate the speaker In response, two groups _ the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Work </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ launched an effort to lobby <PERSON> Pashayan </PERSON> to be tough on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, said he already had doubts about the independence of the investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> by outside counsel <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>. After the newsletter item appeared, his group sent 300 pieces of mail to contributors in <PERSON> Pashayan </PERSON>'s district urging them to contact their congressman and urge him not to side with the Democrats. `` There is enough information on the public record to require strong action'' against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the group's letter argues. `` All of the members of the committee are under pressure, both subtle and overt,'' from the speaker, it states. At about the same time, the right-to-work group mailed letters to 1,500 of its supporters in <PERSON> Pashayan </PERSON>'s district asking that the lawmaker `` stand up to ... the awesome power of Speaker <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Pashayan </PERSON> has received about 100 calls and letters from constituents on the issue, but the flow of contacts has dwindled this week, and the ethics panel member professed to be `` impervious'' to the lobbying effort. But he acknowledged that tension over the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> case has grown as it nears its conclusion. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> is in the process of drafting his final report, consulting occasionally with committee members, and is expected to be ready to present it to the panel for discussion and a vote sometime in February. `` As the former chairman of that committee, I feel certain that nothing of this kind has ever previously intruded in such a way upon the committee's deliberations,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> wrote in his letter to all House members. `` Republican members of the committee, the speaker himself, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as an institution deserve far better than this shabby attempt to undermine the integrity of our processes,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> wrote. Efforts to contract spokesmen for the groups for a response to <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>' letter were unsuccessful.

 A city councilman's offer to buy semiautomatic weapons back from people in the wake of the <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> schoolyard massacre led citizens to turn over an <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> and an AK-47 to police, officials said Wednesday. Councilman <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, a mayoral candidate, displayed the black <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> rifle at a news conference where police Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> outlined procedures for safely bringing weapons to police stations. <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> offered on Tuesday to pay up to $ 300 for semiautomatic rifles and that night received a response, he said. A woman who kept the Uzi under her bed for several years turned it in to `` get it out of her life,'' he said. A 16-year-old boy brought the unloaded AK-47 to a police station Wednesday, saying he received it as a gift and `` just wanted to be rid of it,'' said spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. An AK-47 was used last week by 24-year-old drifter <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> to fire more than 100 bullets into a schoolyard in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, killing five students, wounding 29 students and one adult. The attack by <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, who killed himself, produced calls from state and local officials for bans or restrictions on military-style assault rifles, which can be bought in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> more easily than handguns. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said others who want to take <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> up on his offer to buy the guns should take them to a police station, notifying the station in advance and carefully storing the gun in the trunk of the car, empty of bullets and disassembled. `` These weapons were manufactured to kill people. ... That kind of weapon has no place in a civil society,'' <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said. Police will issue a receipt the person can take to <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>'s office <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, who is running for re-election in April, said he would pay up to $ 300 for each gun, depending on its value, and had $ 50,000 in a campaign committee fund for the effort. Police said that any weapons turned in would be investigated, and noted that possession of a gun that had been converted into a fully automatic weapon is illegal. But <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> said parents, friends and relatives of gun owners, particularly gang members, should welcome the chance to get rid of the powerful and deadly weapons. The weapon displayed by <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> came in a canvas gun bag with a document that identified it as an Uzi Model B, and produced by <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. A resolution calling for legislation to ban the sale of military assault rifles in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was approved by the county Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. The action was spurred by the Jan. 17 shooting deaths of five children in a schoolyard in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Twenty-nine other students and one teacher were wounded. The gunman then killed himself. `` It's important that we send a message to <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> that people here are concerned about this,'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, chairman of the five-member board, said Tuesday. Sheriff <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON> told the supervisors that he was meeting with other law enforcement officials Friday to draft legislation banning future sales of the AK-47 assault rifle and other military-style weapons. The proposed bill also would include a provision allowing judges to increase a sentence by five years for felons convicted of using such weapons in a crime. In addition to Block's suggestions, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> wants to require a 15-day waiting period to buy any gun to allow law enforcement officials to check the buyer's record, a police spokesman said.

<HEAD>Walesa to Meet with Authorities About Solidarity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Solidarity founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> will hold preliminary meetings with government officials Thursday about making the independent union legal again, an adviser reported. In the streets of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, police detained 15 people at protests Wednesday in support of Czechoslovak dissidents and a Polish peace activist who was given a suspended sentence for resisting military service, an opposition spokeswoman said. Thursday's official meetings in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> will be the fourth since August attended by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who founded Solidarity in 1980 as the Soviet bloc's first free trade union. The Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION>'s, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> that has become Solidarity's spiritual home, said Wednesday that <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> would meet with government officials, but he would not identify them. The Solidarity founder lives in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> and works as a shipyard electrician. Solidarity leaders agreed on Sunday to negotiate with the government about legalizing the union, which was suppressed and outlawed after the declaration of martial law in December 1981. Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s government offered during strikes last August to meet with the opposition about economic and political reform, but <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> refused to negotiate without an official decision to legalize Solidarity. In a reversal of policy last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> offered to allow more than one legal trade union and participation by the opposition in government bodies. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had planned to address an officially approved rally Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and hold a news conference in the capital, but aides said both had been canceled. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasiewicz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, a student arrested in mid-December, was the peace activist for whom Wednesday's protest was held. A court sentenced him Wednesday to two years in prison but suspended it for a three-year probationary period, said <PERSON> Bogumila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyszkiewicz </PERSON> of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. She said about 40 supporters tried to attend the trial but about half were barred from the courtroom and <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON>, a Solidarity leader in <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>, was detained briefly. <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON> also was among about 15 people detained after a scuffle outside the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, where 30 protesters went after the trial to raise banners saying `` Down with Communist dictators'' and collect signatures for political prisoners in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Tyszkiewicz </PERSON> said. Police used clubs and a chemical spray to subdue protesters and took those arrested to vans, she reported. Ms. <PERSON> Tyszkiewicz </PERSON> said 10 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> and the peace group Freedom and Peace were detained in <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. She said two of them climbed onto a bus shelter in the market square with a banner demanding <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s removal, three threw leaflets from a supermarket roof and five made speeches.

 The former armed forces chief who founded the Nicaraguan rebel movement in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was assassinated on Wednesday by six men who riddled his car with gunfire, officials said. Former Gen. <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> died of gunshot wounds near his home in the capital's <LOCATION> Florencia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Lobo </PERSON>, director of emergencies at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Radio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a local station, said anonymous callers claimed responsibility on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, a leftist group, but police said they had no evidence to confirm the claim. It was the third assassination in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in the last three weeks. The previous killings involved a Nicaraguan rebel commander and a reputed druglord's lawyer. As head of the national police in 1981, <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> became the godfather of the Contras by telling <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> that anti-Sandinista forces could operate from Honduran territory. In subsequent years, until his ouster by fellow officers annoyed at his high-handedness, the passionate anti-communist continued to develop and promote the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan guerrillas, which became known as Contras. Witnesses said six gunmen waited for <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> outside his home and poured machine-gun fire into his car. The driver also was killed and <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>'s son-in-law was wounded, police said. Police and army troops were deployed to look for the gunmen, said Col. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, the police chief. Military personnel searched cars at barricades set up on roads out of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. One witness, <PERSON> Alba </PERSON> <PERSON> Luz </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the men `` intercepted me, forced me to get out of my car, then fled in my automobile.'' <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, 56, was chief of the armed forces from 1982 to 1984 under the government of President <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON>. Trained in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, he was once considered the most powerful figure in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> frequently denounced the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government of neighboring <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He also presided over the beginning of joint U.S.-Honduran military exercises in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> designed to intimidate the Sandinistas. The Contras, <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> once pledged, would `` wage a war without quarter against international communism, which has now taken over <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' Under his original proposal to <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, described in the book `` Banana Diplomacy'' by Newsday correspondent <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> proposed to use the rebels to provoke a border incident with the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in neighboring <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> then would ask the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for assistance, permitting intervention by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> also supervised a counterinsurgency campaign against suspected Honduran guerrillas that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials privately viewed as a success. Human rights activists charged the campaign relied on death squads linked to the military and that at least 100 people disappeared or were jailed illegally. Honduran forces deny the charges. Honduran officials wanted to keep a low profile on the Contras and officially denied their presence, even when thousands of them operated from border camps. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>'s denunciations of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> brought embarrassing attention to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and Honduran support for the Contras. Military officers led by then-Gen. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> ousted <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> from his post in 1984, and he went to exile in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> after being given a dishonorable discharge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said in 1984 that <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> ousted <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> because he was meddling in politics. Most Honduran political and military sources said the <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> military command orchestrated the ouster because he would not consult them on vital decisions. About 12,000 Contra fighters now are believed to be in camps along the Honduran border. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras ended in February 1988 and they now receive only humanitarian aid. In the two previous assassinations this month, veteran Contra military commander <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rugama </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> was fatally shot just outside the capital on Jan. 7. Nicaraguan rebel radio on Monday blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> for the killing. Also Monday, two gunmen killed <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzana </PERSON>, a lawyer for reputed drug baron <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, whose extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year caused riots and a state of emergency. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> maintained he was deposed illegally, but returned to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in April 1988 after the army command guaranteed his security. He then became an activist with an evangelical church. He was frequently seen walking the streets of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> alone, in civilian garb and without bodyguards. He told a meeting of Christian businessmen in December, `` I've embraced Christ in order to forget the rifle.

 Despite his tears, executed killer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> remained cold-blooded and manipulative to the last as he dribbled out information on his victims in hopes of delaying his execution, an investigator said Wednesday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Keppel </PERSON>, a state attorney general's investigator who tracked Bundy for nearly 15 years, said he believes <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> may have killed more than 100 girls and women. As <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> spoke at a news conference, the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> prosecutor who sent <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> to the electric chair Tuesday estimated he may have slain as many as 50 young women. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said it was still analyzing the confessions given to a parade of law enforcement officers <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> invited to the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> beginning late last week. `` The whole thing was orchestrated from the very beginning,'' <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> said of the confessions, in which he participated. He dismissed as phony <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s final interview putting some of the blame for his activities on pornography. `` Pornography is maybe one-one-thousandths of the whole problem he had,'' <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that the interview with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, a religious broadcaster and psychologist, `` was totally self-serving.'' He said the only remorse <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> felt in his final hours was for himself. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, 42, admitted during his final days to killing 23 women, including 11 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, officials said. He was convicted of killing three others. <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> said he believes the toll is much higher, and that the exact numbers and details will never be known. `` My feeling is he has killed way over 100,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION>, who as a King County detective investigated the eight `` Ted'' killings in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area that occurred in 1974. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> confessed to those crimes, and to killings in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> has interviewed Bundy several times in the past few years, and said he would take the information gathered in his latest sessions and present it to other law agencies in hopes it will help solve still-unexplained murders. During the final interviews, <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> also questioned <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> about the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killings of western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, primarily to gain insight into how a serial killer thinks and acts. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was imprisoned in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> when the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killings began in the early 1980s. <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> played a tape he had recorded during a session with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> on Friday, when the former <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> resident and law school dropout admitted to killing the eight `` Ted'' victims. In the tape, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> describes how he lured a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> student, <PERSON> Georgann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, to his car, beat her with a crowbar, and then drove her to a secluded, grassy spot in the hills near <LOCATION> Issaquah </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> would not play the part of the tape where Bundy detailed how he killed and apparently mutilated her and other victims, out of respect for the families of the victims. `` I was shocked,'' he said of the way the victims were treated. He said investigators had n't known <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s methods because the victims were found weeks and months after their deaths, and many bones had been strewn by animals. <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> used stalling tactics during the last days, even as he invited law enforcement officers from various states to the prison to talk about murder cases. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> would `` let'em squirm, let'em dangle, for a little more information,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION>, hopeful that such tactics would win him a last-minute respite from the death penalty, if only temporarily. However, it was only because death was imminent that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> did confess at all, added <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION>. Had the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> governor indicated in the slightest way he would spare <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> to allow law officers more time to question him, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> would have clammed up, <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> said. He also said law enforcement officers would have been well advised to use a different method in questioning Bundy, with those who were successful given more of the task.

<TEXT>
 The fourth game of the World Chess Championship Candidates quarterfinal between <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ended in a 17-move draw Wednesday, leaving the match score tied 2-2. Playing with the advantage of the white pieces, <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> exchanged the queens on the ninth move of a Reti opening, but failed to gain any advantage in the resulting endgame. Some experts attributed <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON>'s lackluster performance to the psychological fallout from his loss Tuesday in the third game, which enabled <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> to tie the score. <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON>, a 34-year-old from <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, seized the lead in the six-game contest with a victory in the second game. The winner of the Candidates cycle will challenge world champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> for his title in 1990. The fifth game will be played Friday with <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON>, 28, playing white. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hebert </PERSON>, a Canadian international master who is commentating on the games, said <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> will use the free day Thursday to improve his black defenses. French chess expert <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaeg </PERSON> said the contest resembled `` roulette.'' With just two games remaining, she said, one blunder or brilliancy would decide the outcome. In case of a 3-3 tie, two more games will be played, followed by a series of tiebreakers played at an increasingly fast pace. A win scores one point and a draw a half. British Grandmaster <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> is already through to the semifinal stage after defeating fellow Briton <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> in August.

It poses me a political problem a little bit in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> served as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s convention manager and was widely credited with helping to end the convention on a note of unity the night that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accepted the presidential nomination and then was joined on the podium by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his family. A former vice chairman of the party, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had worked for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> as general counsel and staff director of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He was deputy campaign manager for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s unsuccessful bid for the 1980 presidential nomination. After the 1988 Democratic convention, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> served as a senior adviser to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> presidential campaign. <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> ended his campaign shortly after the four contenders appeared at a closed meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Caucus. `` It was n't that exciting,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, a supporter of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` Since we do n't have a vote, it was n't exactly clear what was supposed to be happening.'' A former party vice chairman, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was working hard to create a bandwagon mood that would swing more votes his way. `` <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> continues to move closer to winning the chair of the <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION>,'' said his campaign manager <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> as he announced that 45 committee members from Western states were endorsing the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney. `` We're at the threshold of victory,'' he said. One House Democratic source, who asked not to be identified, said that during the meeting with the caucus, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> assured <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members he would remain neutral in the race for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination _ a year when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is considered likely to make his third bid for the nomination. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also emphasized that his role in party affairs began years before May 1988 when he agreed to join the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign as convention manager. One vocal opponent of the black attorney, <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, said his opposition had nothing to do with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s race or his role in the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he objected to turning the party leadership over to someone he described as part of the `` ultra liberal'' wing of the party. `` I ca n't help the fact that he's black,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` I ca n't help the fact that he was <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign manager.

 Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> told former colleagues on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday `` there is a need for reform'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and he will work with them to achieve it. On the opening day of his confirmation hearing, <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> also said that he would aim for budget savings and realized the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration must `` try to achieve as much or more defense with less money.'' Tower, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Republican, was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> from 1981-84 and led the fight in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s trillion-dollar military buildup. However, he rebuffed suggestions that he might be unable to cut the Pentagon budget. `` I am not such a mindless hawk that I will come before you and ask for increases I know you will not grant,'' Tower told the committee. On the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> said he welcomed changes brought by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but he also said they did not `` alter the fact that in terms of political philosophy and offensive capability, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> remains our greatest adversary.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, `` there is a need for reform,'' declared Tower, vowing to implement changes legislated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He told lawmakers he had severed his ties with defense contractors for whom he worked as a consultant over the past two years, and said he would appoint `` tough, aggressive'' deputies and adopt a policy of `` zero tolerance'' toward misbehavior in the Pentagon. Tower said he would review all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons systems with the knowledge `` that difficult choices be made.'' `` Nothing is sacred,'' he said. `` There is no room in the future of the defense budget for costly mistakes.'' `` We ca n't afford any more pet rocks, whether they are my pet rocks, the services' pet rocks, or <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' pet rocks,'' said Tower. Tower declined to answer some of the toughest questions from his former colleagues on whether he favored purchasing major weapons systems as the mobile Midgetman missile, the rail-based MX missile, or the B-2 stealth bomber. He said those decisions awaited review by the new administration. Tower's former colleagues treated him with respect, although many said in their introductory remarks they would quiz him fairly but fully on a range of other topics, including health, personal and professional matters. Panel chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., said the committee would be reviewing a lengthy <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> report that he said was completed on Jan. 6 The time required to complete that review reportedly delayed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination of Tower. At the close of the session Wednesday, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said the hearings would resume Thursday with questions on possible conflict of interest involving contractors with whom Tower had acted as a consultant. But there seeemed little doubt that Tower would be confirmed. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> questioned Tower on how he planned to trim Pentagon spending and what changes he would support in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense and diplomatic policies. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security strategy is currently overreaching and ambiguous,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the Texan who was the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee last fall, introduced him and said he hoped `` the committee, after giving him his baptism of fire, will approve his nomination.'' `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is too much of a conservative to give a blank check from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> to the Pentagon,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Two Republican senators, Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, also testified on Tower's behalf. A committee liberal, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said that when <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> was chairman, `` I did n't always agree with Senator Tower, but I respected him and look forward to working with him as secretary of defense. Tower's confirmation hearing took place in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION>, the big hall used during the Watergate and Iran-Contra hearings. Aides said that some sensitive issues might be raised in sessions closed to the public. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, who is 63, was hospitalized for surgery to remove a cancerous rectal polyp and later a benign polyp and a 12-inch piece of his colon. Questions linger from his personal life, as well. He was divorced in 1987 from his second wife, <PERSON> Lilla </PERSON>, who charged that he had committed `` marital misconduct.'' As the hearing got under way, Tower introduced his three daughters, <PERSON> Penny </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON>, and his first wife, <PERSON> Lou </PERSON>, with whom he remains on friendly terms. He declined <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s invitation to introduce other friends, including <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyser </PERSON>, his companion for the past year, who sat behind Tower family members. Tower spent 24 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, retiring in January 1985. Shortly thereafter, he was appointed chief negotiator to arms control talks with the Soviets in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. He quit that after 14 months, and served as chairman of the presidential panel that investigated the Iran-Contra affair. One committee member, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., commended Tower on `` the hard-headed approach'' he said <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> took as a negotiator For the past two years, <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> has worked as a defense consultant in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, advising industry giants such as <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>. In 1988, Tower earned more than $ 665,277 in consulting and director fees, and more than $ 74,000 for speaking engagements, according to his financial disclosure report. Additionally, he received $ 48,743 in federal pensions, the records show.

 An alleged gang-rape victim forced under threat of jail to testify was taken from the courthouse on a stretcher Wednesday, but hospital officials declined to say why she fell ill. Meanwhile, a prosecution witness who admitted he once told a psychiatrist the alleged attack victim `` loved it'' testified Wednesday that she cried and tried to resist the men who sexually assaulted her on the hood of a car last March. An ambulance took the woman to <ORGANIZATION> Alice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgeons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> just before she was to begin her second day of testimony in the aggravated kidnapping trial of <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Chew </PERSON>, who also faces a separate sexual assault trial in the case. Nine other men have also been indicted in the incident, in which the woman claimed she was assaulted by up to 20 men. All have pleaded innocent. The woman's testimony in the case's first trial in September led to the sexual assault conviction of a 24-year-old man, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison. The woman was reported in stable condition. Hospital emergency room personnel and nursing supervisors said the woman's physician refused to release further information. After the woman was taken to the hospital, District Judge <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinojosa </PERSON> told the jury she had `` fallen ill'' and would testify later. Her testimony was cut short Tuesday after she reported fainting during an afternoon break and said her stomach and head ached. Witness <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Briones </PERSON>, speaking in Spanish as a court interpreter translated, testified Wednesday that the woman `` did n't want to do it She was complaining. She had tears.'' <PERSON> Briones </PERSON>, 29, was indicted on a sexual assault charge in the case, but his trial date has not been set. <PERSON> Briones </PERSON>, who also testified for the state in the September trial, said he saw Chew sexually assault the woman with a beer bottle while other men held her down on the car at a ranch where a cockfight was being held. `` He just laughed,'' <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> said of Chew, adding that the woman clearly did not appear to enjoy it. He admitted Wednesday, however, to <PERSON> Chew </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, that during a court-ordered mental-competency examination last June he told a psychiatrist that the woman `` loved it.'' <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> testified that he fondled the woman and tried to have sex with her that night, but that he had consumed two cases of beer that rendered him impotent. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> if he knew of a reported arrangement by the prosecution to recommend probation for him if he testified against his co-defendants, but <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> said he was not aware of such a deal. Also Wednesday, District Attorney's investigator <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvan </PERSON> testified that the morning after the reported abduction and gang rape the woman appeared `` withdrawn, almost in shock.'' The woman had asked not to testify Tuesday, saying publicity from the case disrupted her personal life, but she took the stand after <PERSON> Hinojosa </PERSON> threatened to jail her for contempt of court. The judge also denied defense and state motions Tuesday to dismiss the aggravated kidnapping charge against Chew. Later in the day the woman testified that <PERSON> Chew </PERSON> helped abduct her. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said in his opening statement Tuesday the trial would include testimony about nymphomania.

 A hospital administrator said Wednesday he is investigating the discovery of a human fetus and amputated body parts buried on the hospital's grounds. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Auxilio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutuo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said he is trying to determine whether hospital employees were responsible for the improper disposal of the remains. Workers digging a ditch Tuesday behind the hospital's emergency room unearthed plastic bags containing the decomposed remains of a fetus of undetermined age, along with nine legs and two toes, authorities said. Police found four more legs at the site Wednesday before calling off their search, said government prosecutor <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Claverol </PERSON>. Forensic pathologist <PERSON> Yucasta </PERSON> <PERSON> Brugal </PERSON> said the nine legs found Tuesday were amputated from patients apparently afflicted with gangrene. Ms. <PERSON> Brugal </PERSON> said she would question hospital staff about the disposal after the remains were analyzed. `` All I can say is that the parts were not adequately disposed of,'' she said, adding that body parts are usually cremated or buried at an authorized site.

<HEAD>Draft Agreement Would Transfer Indian Artifact Collection to Smithsonian</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A draft agreement has been reached to transfer title to the nation's largest collection of Indian artifacts from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Museum of the American Indian to the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a spokeswoman said Wednesday. `` The plan is still being negotiated and there's nothing that's signed,'' said <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the Smithsonian Essentially, the agreement would transfer title of the Heye Collection to the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> would be obligated to maintain a satellite museum of `` significant'' size in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. This would legally fulfill terms of the trust which established <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Museum of the American Indian 73 years ago and which requires the collection to be in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Under the draft agreement, most of the collection would be housed in a new national museum of the American Indian to be built by the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> on the Mall in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> museum could be located in the old <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Custom House in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, as has been previously suggested, but `` that's one of the things that's open to negotiation at this point,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said The draft is to be presented to the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s regents next week. The Museum of the American Indian had not signed the memorandum either, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. The latest proposal emerged after years of debating how best to preserve and exhibit the more than 1 million artifacts comprising the collection of the late <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Heye </PERSON>. The current Museum of the American Indian, in upper <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, is only big enough to display about 1 percent of the collection. In addition, it is located in a decaying neighborhood which attracts few casual visitors. The rest of the collection has been moldering in a four-story warehouse in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. Various plans had been raised for several years to move the collection, which at one point appeared on the verge of going to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> officials intervened, pointing out that the <LOCATION> Heye </LOCATION> trust requires that it remain in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Last April, <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> officials rejected a proposal to break the collection into three parts, with one moving to the Mall, one remaining at the old <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> site and another moving into the old <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Custom House in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The Smithsonian's key objection to the earlier plan was that it did not want only to have borrowing privileges.

<HEAD>U.S. Lawyer Argues in Supreme Court for Right to Take Notes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lawyer argued in an unusual hearing before the full <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should end restrictions on taking notes in courts. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Repeta </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> charged that the ban on notetaking by spectators in most criminal trials restricts freedom of reporting, since only members of exclusive judiciary press clubs generally are allowed to take notes. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s controversial press club system, most government agencies give preferential access to information to members of semi-official press clubs. The clubs generally exclude foreign journalists and Japanese reporters who work for smaller newspapers and magazines. While attending a tax trial in 1983-84 as part of his research on Japanese tax law, <PERSON> Repeta </PERSON> was repeatedly denied permission by the judge to take notes. With support from the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, he lodged a complaint, which was rejected by both the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a very important international issue,'' <PERSON> Repeta </PERSON> said in an interview. `` You ca n't take notes unless you are in a press club, and no foreign reporters are members of the press clubs. If we win, that will change.'' Repeta's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal hearing Wednesday was unusual because foreigners seldom address the court, and it is rare that all 15 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices hear a case. Speaking in Japanese, <PERSON> Repeta </PERSON> urged the judges to `` set a democratic standard of openness that will ultimately be followed by other branches of the Japanese government.'' In an interview, he said: `` The big question is this: What is the standing of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the world and what kind of model will <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> give the rest of the world? `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s national government has been very slow in adopting any changes that would increase the openness of information. If the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> does n't show an example of openness, we ca n't expect much from the Diet -LRB- parliament -RRB- or other government agencies,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said in rejecting <PERSON> Repeta </PERSON>'s appeal in December 1987 that if `` there is even a slight possibility that influence may be exerted upon the fair and smooth conduct of a trial, restrictions on taking of notes are unavoidable.'' Although members of court press clubs are allowed to take notes, they do not have access to court documents and can take photographs only before the actual start of a trial, said <PERSON> Takeshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Maezawa </PERSON>, ombudsman of the <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper. `` We Japanese journalists should place importance on matters affecting freedom of the press, freedom of information and the exchange of information between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the rest of the world, and understand the greater implications of this case with regard to those matters,'' he wrote in a column.

<HEAD>Soviet Withdrawal From Hungary Detailed; Karpov Optimistic About
Geneva</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Dimitry </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> has given a breakdown of troops to be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> over the next two years as part of a unilateral Soviet troop reduction plan, media reported Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the Soviet senior arms expert said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will seek early progress at <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks on reducing conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that are due to start in March. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> detailed the withdrawal figures in a letter to Hungarian Defense Minister <PERSON> Ferenc </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpati </PERSON>, saying the first stage to be completed by July will include one armored division and an armored training regiment, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported. However, <PERSON> Karpati </PERSON> gave no exact date for the start of the withdrawal and <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> defense minister refused to say how many troops are to leave in the three-stage pullout. He said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would publish a detailed timetable on what forces would be removed and when by the end of this month. There are an estimated 62,000 Soviet troops stationed in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Karpati </PERSON> and other officials have said about one fourth of them are to be withdrawn under the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> plan. The withdrawals are part of a unilateral move announced in December by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to remove some 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> as well as 5,000 tanks by 1990. The gesture was intended to give impetus to the March talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Karpati </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>'s schedule foresaw the withdrawal of an airborne assault battalion and a fighter plane regiment from Hungarian territory in the second half of this year. In 1990, a chemical defense battalion and the staff of a training school for non-commissioned officers in eastern <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would be withdrawn, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Karpati </PERSON> as saying. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, Soviet deputy foreign minister and senior arms control expert, suggested the scheduled <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks stand a better chance of success than their failed predecessor, the <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Balanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reduction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Talks </ORGANIZATION> launched in the early 1970s. `` We are going to participate in those talks open-mindedly,'' <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> said of the conference, due to start March 9 with 23 nations from East and West. He said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> intends to `` help from the very start to negotiate solutions that can bring in a very short period of time real reductions,'' with elimination of imbalances between the two camps' military power in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as first priority He added the Soviets are `` not rigid'' on the issue of verification and `` will be ready to discuss various possibilities.'' <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to lead a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> disarmament workshop. The official Czechoslovak news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> is to hold annual military exercises in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in the first half of February. The Hungarian news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported that the exercises, code-named `` Friendship'89'' will involve the Hungarian and Czechoslovak armies as well as Soviet forces stationed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Neither news agency gave an exact date for the exercise.

 A former diplomat said on Wednesday he was told the chief of the military government's secret police ordered the assassination in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of dissident Chilean politician <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Letelier </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> said in sworn testimony the mastermind was identified to him as Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> <PERSON> Sepulveda </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has tried for years to extradite the former secret police chief and his assistant, Col. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON>, both now retired. <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> denied the accusations Wednesday night. `` Neither I nor any official of the intelligence agency were involved'' in the killing, he said on <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s Channel 13. Letelier and American aide <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffitt </PERSON> were killed Sept. 21, 1976, when a remote-controlled bomb blew up their car. He had been a Cabinet minister and ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the government overthrown by Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in 1973, and was among <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s most influential critics abroad. <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> was one of seven former officials questioned last week at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Newspapers carried his testimony in Wednesday's editions and <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> confirmed the accounts to The Associated Press. He told testified to Judge <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Banados </PERSON> that air force Gen. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Montero </PERSON> told him during a meeting in the late 1970s `` this genius of intelligence mounted an operation to assassinate Letelier.'' <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> said <PERSON> Montero </PERSON>, then undersecretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> government, identified the `` genius'' as <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION> secret police at the time of the assassination. In his testimony, <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> said another participant in the meeting, former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON>, told him <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> did not know of the plot. <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> `` asked Contreras three times privately and two more times in front of witnesses whether he had something to do with the Letelier case and <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said no,'' <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> later ordered administrative sanctions against <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> `` for lying to the president,'' the former ambassador said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extradition request in 1979 on grounds of insufficient evidence that <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> and <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> were involved. An American employee of the general's secret police, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Townley </PERSON>, confessed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to planting the bomb on the order of superiors. Army Maj. <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Larios </PERSON>, who fled <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> in 1987 and surrendered to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities, confessed to being an accomplice and implicated <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> and <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> has not cooperated, and they invoked a 1914 bilateral treaty this month calling for international arbitration of disputes that can not be resolved by other means. Under it, the dispute would go to a commission associated with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. `` We energetically reject the implicit pressure in an affair that we are handling seriously and professionally,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Errazuriz </PERSON> declared Tuesday. He said the government had not decided on a response.

 The prosecutor who sent <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> to the electric chair said Wednesday that the serial sex killer may have slain as many 50 young women, a toll frustrated investigators have sought to prove for years. State Attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said that just before Tuesday's execution at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Starke </LOCATION>, he and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> expert on serial killers informally discussed a weekend of Bundy confessions <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagmeier </PERSON> told him that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s confessions closed the books on 13 killings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>; provided information that may never be confirmed on 14 more cases in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and touched on at least 20 more slayings in various states dating back to 1969 Three <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> killings charged to <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> would be added to the 13 closed cases, putting the total to at least 50. `` I do n't know that it's far off from the figures everybody has bandied about anyway,'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said. `` Those are the figures I've heard for many years I do n't think we'll ever know exactly how many.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Keppel </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state investigator who tracked <LOCATION> Bundy </LOCATION> nearly 15 years, said he believes <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> may have killed more than 100 girls and women _ but that exact details and numbers may never be known. <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> played a tape he had recorded Friday with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, when <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> admitted to the eight `` Ted'' killings of young women in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area in 1974. In the tape, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> describes how he lured a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> student, <PERSON> Georgann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, to his car, beat her with a crowbar, and then drove her to a secluded, grassy spot in the hills near <LOCATION> Issaquah </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Keppel </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> used stalling tactics in his last days, hoping to delay his execution by feeding crumbs of information on his murders to investigators, but would have fallen silent if a reprieve had come through. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> said no formal statement would be made about <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s crimes until officials have been briefed at the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, center for the analysis of violent crime. <PERSON> Hagmeier </PERSON> checked out of his Starke motel Wednesday. Until last week <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> had denied killing anyone. He was convicted in three slayings in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and charged in only one death in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>; several bodies have never been found. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, a 42-year-old law school dropout and one-time <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> activist in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, was executed shortly after 7 a.m. Tuesday for the 1978 kidnap, rape and murder of 12-year-old <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, whose body was found in an abandoned pigsty. In an interview Monday with psyhologist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> refused to discuss details of the <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> murder. `` I ca n't talk about that right now ... It's too painful.'' He was also sentenced to death for killing two <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> students in their Chi Omega Sorority house on the university campus, just three weeks before Miss <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> was abducted in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He died under his fourth death warrant. `` There is no way in the world that killing me is going to restore those beautiful children to their parents,'' said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, who told <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> he did n't want to die. But <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said he deserved his punishment, and expressed remorse about his long, bloody trail of kidnappings, sadistic sexual mutilations and slayings. `` I do n't want to die, I'm not going to kid you. ... -LRB- but -RRB- I deserve, certainly, the most extreme punishment society has. I think society deserves to be protected from me and from others like me,'' he said. In the 29-minute interview, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said his home life had been normal but early experiences with pornography had `` crystallized'' violent tendencies within him. `` I am essentially a normal person ... except for this destructive segment,'' he said, emphasizing that he did n't blame pornography for his actions and took full responsibility. `` People need to recognize ... those of us who are or who have been so much influenced by violence in the media, in particular pornographic violence, are not some kind of inherent monsters. We are your sons and we are your husbands and we grew up in regular families. And pornography can reach out and snatch a kid out of any house today.'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> warned that there were others like himself. `` There are loose in the towns and their communities people like me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in, day out, by violence in the media ... particularly sexual violence,'' he said. About 100 people gathered Wednesday in the <LOCATION> Rotunda </LOCATION> at the state Capitol for a vigil opposing capital punishment and `` to mourn the victims of <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> and to grieve with their friends and families,'' said <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. Also Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sens. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., and Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., refiled a bill offered in previous years to cure what <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> called a federal judiciary `` mired in an encumbering backlog'' of frivolous If enacted, the bill would give convicted killers a one-year limit on filing federal `` habeas corpus'' appeals after state-court appeals were exhausted, and a two-year limit on challenging denials of such federal appeals. A double execution is scheduled in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> next week. If both <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lightbourn </PERSON>, under his second warrant, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, under his fourth death warrant, go to the electric chair, it will be the first double execution on the same day in nearly 25 years. <PERSON> Lightbourn </PERSON>, 29, was condemned for the 1981 shooting of <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Farrell </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, 47, was sentenced to die for the shooting murder of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, who was abducted in 1977 in <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last executed two inmates on one day May 12, 1964, when <PERSON> Sie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> died 28 minutes apart. Several multiple executions have been scheduled in recent years, but appeals have blocked them.

 A huge fireball was spotted over northwestern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Wednesday afternoon, and one expert said it probably was an unusually large and fiery meteor. The sighting was reported to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> by a motorcyclist traveling on a coastal highway about 1:30 p.m. Later, dozens of witnesses reported it to broadcast stations from the coast to south-central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Spainhower </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said that judging from the various reports the fireball was probably a bolide, a brilliant meteor that appears to explode in the Earth's atmosphere Some bolides are large enough that they fail to burn up completely before hitting the earth's surface as meteorites. Witnesses described the fireball as plainly visible on a bright, sunny winter afternoon, traveling from west to east. Many also reported they heard a sonic boom after the sighting. <PERSON> Spainhower </PERSON> said that if those descriptions of the size and the trajectory are accurate, it was quite possible the meteor landed somewhere in eastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He said most meteors _ often called `` shooting stars'' _ range in size from a pea to a walnut and burn up in the air. <PERSON> Spainhower </PERSON> said a bolide of such magnitude is very rare and he encouraged the public to call in reports to help scientists determine if it landed, and where.

<HEAD>Stalled Jury in Steinberg Case Goes Three Days without A Verdict</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The jury in the <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> murder trial ended three days of deliberations without a verdict Wednesday, and a defense lawyer said he was `` guardedly optimistic'' about an acquittal on the main charge of murder. The jurors, who recessed at 8:55 p.m., indicated the day before they were sharply divided when they asked the judge whether they could move to the lesser homicide counts against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> if they were not unanimous on the top count, second-degree murder. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> repeated what he told the six men and six women before they got the case Monday: That they must unanimously acquit <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of murdering 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> before moving down to first-degree manslaughter, second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. Deliberations were scheduled to resume at 10 a.m. Thursday. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> said the questions the jurors asked Tuesday and the length of their deliberations had made him `` guardedly optimistic'' about <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> being acquitted on the murder charge. `` This is an extremely intelligent jury,'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said. `` If they ca n't resolve the murder charge, they're going to say, ` We're not going to sit here and look at each other,' but they're not going to permit a mistrial, either.'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said he expected the panel to exercise what is known in legal circles as `` jury nullification.'' This means they would disregard the judge's legal instructions and do what they feel is right. The jurors sent out no notes during the morning session Wednesday, and shortly before 6 p.m. asked for a rereading of testimony by pathologists who testified for the prosecution and the defense. The first was Dr. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a neuropathologist at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and a prosecution witness. He said the force that caused <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s head injuries was equivalent to a three-story fall and could have been inflicted by a man the size of <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, who is 6 feet tall and weighs 180 to 190 pounds. The jury also asked to rehear the testimony of Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON>, a coroner from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, and the defense pathologist. He agreed with <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> that <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was the victim of a homicide but testified her injuries could have been caused by a woman the size of <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s former companion. In addition, the jurors asked to rehear <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON>'s testimony on the CAT scan of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s brain. The CAT scan, he said, showed that less force had caused <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s injuries than <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> had testified. The jurors said that after rehearing the testimony they would go to dinner and retire for the night. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, a disbarred lawyer, is charged in the fatal beating of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, the girl he obtained at birth from an unwed <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> teen-ager and raised as his own but never legally adopted. The child was comatose when taken from <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment on Nov. 2, 1987, to a hospital where she died of a brain injury three days later. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said he believes Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, the prosecution's star witness, is the center of the jury's deliberation difficulties. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, a former children's book editor, testified that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> told her in bed, after they smoked cocaine and while <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> lay comatose on their bathroom floor, that he had `` knocked <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> down and she did n't want to get up.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s lawyers charge that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> fatally beat the child in a jealous rage. The prosecution maintains that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, against whom murder charges were dropped after she agreed to be a prosecution witness, was too physically and emotionally disabled by 12 years of living with <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> to have harmed <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secrets are easier to steal than toothpaste from a department store, former navy radioman and convicted spy <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said in an interview broadcast Wednesday night. `` I have to say that <ORGANIZATION> K-Mart </ORGANIZATION> security is better than anything the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would have. I mean K-Mart protects their toothpaste better than the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> protects their top secrets,'' said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who was a chief warrant officer with top secret clearance. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> spoke in an interview filmed in the federal prison in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, where he is serving life for running a Soviet spy ring. The commercial Channel 4 television program, `` Dispatches,'' calling him <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s `` most notorious spy,'' said it was the first time he had been interviewed. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said the lax security enabled him to photograph decoding material and technical manuals at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bases and on warships, from which the Soviets were able to build copies of the latest cryptographic machines. He said when offered some of the material, the Soviets told him not to bother, indicating they had other spies at work. `` They were probably paying for the stuff five times,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said he was interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and `` the boys went pale'' when he told them the Soviets wanted nothing on machines that went into service in the early 1980s with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, indicating they already had what they needed. The program said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s spying activities would have compromised secret material of all the navies in the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. It said the Soviets `` read millions of secret messages'' exchanged between the various navies. The balding, bespectacled and bearded spy looked relaxed and confident and was smoking a pipe. The program said he insisted on being interviewed in civilian and not prison garb. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said his espionage even included updating his own security clearance and inserting it in his <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> records. `` The fact of the matter is I did perfect work for both governments at the same time. My work for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was extraordinary, exemplary. My work for the Soviets was also exemplary,'' he said. The program said the Soviets paid <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> $ 1 million for supplying them with code-breaking information over 18 years. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> showed no remorse in the interview and often smiled and laughed but he said at the end, `` I'm very sorry, sorry for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, for the country. `` The Walker spy ring is behind bars, but there are still more than 4 million Americans cleared for access to more than a trillion classified documents. In the past eight years alone, 40 traitors have been caught trying to sell secrets,'' the program said. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said in conclusion: `` You have to assume they are not arresting everybody. What percentage do you think they are arresting _ half, a third, 1 percent? I do n't know.''

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court on Wednesday revived a lesbian's lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> for denying her a security clearance. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said a claim that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> has a policy of rejecting clearances for any homosexual _ an allegation the agency denies _ should not have been dismissed without a trial. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s explanation for its actions in this case suggests the agency `` considers all persons who engage in homosexual activity to be unacceptable security risks,'' the court said in a 3-0 decision. The ruling allows <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubbs </PERSON>, an openly lesbian employee of a military contractor on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, to go to trial on her claim that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> unconstitutionally denied her a high-level security clearance in 1981. Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayer </PERSON>, noting that his client received a similar clearance from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, said the decision, `` gives us a chance to embarrass the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'' by forcing it to justify its practices. He said he was disappointed the court required her to prove discrimination before the federal judge who had previously thrown out her case. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> would not comment on behalf of the government. <PERSON> Dubbs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> maintains she needed the clearance to advance in her job as a senior technical illustrator for SRI International of <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> turned her down in a letter that gave two reasons: she had not volunteered information about her homosexuality during an initial security investigation, an action that an agency official described as showing a `` willingness to engage in deceptive behavior;'' and, although her current lover was also an open lesbian, <PERSON> Dubbs </PERSON> might have a future partner `` who is not an open homosexual and who fears public exposure.''

 Five ranch workers were charged Wednesday in the slayings of more than 40 wild horses and burros, in a continuing federal investigation into the killings of at least 10 times that many animals. The workers are charged with violating the Wild and Free Roaming Horse and Burro Act, a misdemeanor punishable by one year in prison and a fine of $ 2,000, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney Will Mattly. A federal grand jury returned indictments Tuesday naming <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> of <PERSON> Lovelock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thacker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Winnemucca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thacker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Emory </PERSON> <PERSON> Hage </PERSON> of <PERSON> Cosgrave </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mattly </PERSON> said. The indictments were handed up Tuesday, sealed under a judge's order so the defendants would not know they had been charged until they were in custody Mattly He said all but <PERSON> Hage </PERSON> were in custody and <PERSON> Hage </PERSON> was expected to surrender. The four in custody were held under $ 50,000 bail. <LOCATION> Morehead </LOCATION> is charged with seven counts of killing a wild horse or burro from May 15 through June 1988 and one count of selling a mustang and a burro to a livestock yard last February. He and <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> are charged in two other counts with killing 28 wild horses and two wild colts in November 1987; <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thacker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hage </PERSON> face five counts each for killing five wild horses in August 1987. <PERSON> Mattly </PERSON> said the killings were in <LOCATION> Lander </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pershing </LOCATION> counties, where more than 500 mustangs have been found dead since last August. Most of the animals had been shot. Mattly gave no motives for the killings and would not say how the five men were tracked down except to credit `` an extensive investigation on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> law enforcement staff.'' Bureau spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said agents `` have very heavily investigated since it was first brought to our attention last August. We have interviewed over 200 people and done extensive on-ground investigation.'' <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Shane </PERSON>, public affairs specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION>, said the bureau considered the case to be far from ended.

<HEAD>Church Group Denounces Violence Against Native Indians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A church group on Wednesday denounced the slaying of 36 Indians during 1988 and blamed the government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> for `` increasing violence against native populations'' in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. At least 28 of the deaths were linked to battles over land, and in the majority of cases `` authorities took no measures to find or punish the guilty parties,'' <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Brand </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said in a press conference. Brand said the worst Indian massacre last year was the March 28 slaying of 14 <ORGANIZATION> Tikuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> in the far northern state of <LOCATION> Amazonas </LOCATION> after a dispute over land with a wealthy wood dealer. In a press release, the council also mentioned the death of 25 <ORGANIZATION> Yanomami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> through diseases transmitted by white men such as malaria or poisoning by mercury, which is used by gold prospectors to refine the precious metal. <PERSON> Brand </PERSON> said the government's refusal to remove the thousands of gold prospectors from <LOCATION> Yanomami </LOCATION> territory in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle region `` will allow the continued massacre of this people.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Yanomami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> are <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s most primitive tribe and live almost without contact with the modern world close to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s northern border with <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> <PERSON> Brand </PERSON> said the government was `` responsible for the state of chronic violence'' that exists in the rain forest, which is rich in gold, diamonds, iron ore and uranium. Currently about 220,000 native Indians and 430 tribes remain out of a population estimated at 5 million when <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> was discovered by the Portuguese. About 15 percent of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> has been destroyed by farming, gold prospecting and mining, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. An estimated 400,000 gold prospectors are located throughout the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> and, along with farmers and wood-cutters, often involve themselves in territory disputes with Indians.

 The government has charged the jailed boss of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> with homicide in the 1983 shooting of a local labor leader, the Attorney General's Office announced Wednesday. It was the second murder charge brought against <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>, who for years was the de facto head of the union. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> <PERSON> Trejos </PERSON> told a news conference that <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>, 66, ordered the Sept. 8, 1983, slaying of <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> <PERSON> Pancardo </PERSON>, a local oil union official and former congressman. <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> ordered his own bodyguards to kill <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>. <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> did not cite possible motives for the killing. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> was killed by a bullet in the head. `` This crime has been investigated since it occurred, but <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> gave us the details,'' <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> said in response to questions as to why it took so long to identify those responsible for the slaying. <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> identified <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> as the bodyguard who planned the killing. <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON> was arrested along with <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> on charges of homicide, weapons possession and resisting arrest. <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON> is a former commander with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> in the northeast state of <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION>. Four other bodyguards are being investigated in connection with <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>' killing, <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> was arrested after a shootout with federal agents at his home on Jan. 10 in <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madero </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION>, 340 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON> and seven other detainees were charged with homicide in connection with the death of a federal agent killed in the gunfight.

 A 4-mile-long ditch that a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official compared Wednesday to a `` buried <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall'' is planned for a stretch of the U.S.-Mexican border to stem drug smuggling into <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. But the plan is being criticized as `` too little too late'' by a group that advocates building fences along the border and blasted as repressive by immigrant rights organizations. Associate Attorney General <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> said he proposed the idea last fall as a way to discourage drug smugglers from driving loads of cocaine, marijuana and heroin across the border near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The plan being undertaken by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was approved last month by Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said. The ditch, which <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> likened to `` our buried <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall'' will be deep and wide enough to discourage smugglers from driving trucks and cars across the border along a four-mile stretch of flat desert east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ysidro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The associate attorney general, who is leaving office with the start of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, said the desert stretch in the <LOCATION> Otay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> area east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ysidro </LOCATION> is a major drug smuggling route. `` The cocaine, marijuana and heroin from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is being carried across the border between the points of entry'' that are operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said. `` This is not intended in any way to interfere with legitimate traffic or trade, it is not intended to stop legal entry,'' he said. The Border Patrol has tried to stop vehicle traffic across the desert by digging shallow trenches, but smugglers have been able to fill in the ditches to drive through, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said. `` No country is a country that ca n't protect its border,'' said <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, who oversaw law enforcement agencies in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, including the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is one of many systems to do it.'' `` I am sure it will be applauded by people who are sick and tired of the deluge of cocaine and heroin that is flowing across the Mexican border,'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said in an interview. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Cozart </PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agent in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> sector, said, `` This is no panacea to all of the drive-through situations we have in the <LOCATION> Otay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> area. It's just another tool that they'll be using.'' But the plan has its critics. `` The drainage ditch is too little too late if it is to be taken seriously as a method of deterring illegal entry,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, assistant director of Federation for American Immigration Reform. `` There is a serious problem at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> of which a very, very small component is high-speed drive-throughs'' by drug smugglers, said <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, whose organization is preparing to release a study proposing ways to `` harden'' the U.S.-Mexican border. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said a barrier of earth reinforced with concrete would be a more effective means of preventing drug trafficking across the desert. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, called it `` a very repressive and a very ill-founded idea.'' `` Rather than constructing the ditch, I think they should hire more people, more agents at the border,'' <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said. `` Once again, we appear to be obsessed with dealing with symptoms instead of trying to find solutions'' to illegal immigration, said <PERSON> Arnoldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, national political director for the <ORGANIZATION> Washington-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>. He said the plan `` will have negative consequences, symbolically as well as substantively.'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> confirmed a report in Wednesday editions of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times, which said the 5-feet deep and 14-foot wide ditch was planned for completion by next fall. The isolated Otay <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> area, a gateway into <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for illegal immigrants, is believed to be the most popular crossing spot along the entire 1,900-mile U.S.-Mexico border. About one third of the 1.2 million illegal immigrants captured along the border last year were apprehended at <LOCATION> Otay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>. Up to 400 vehicles are believed to cross the border illegally into <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> each month, officials said.

 A 6-year-old girl died Wednesday after being shot in the head by her 8-year-old brother with a gun their grandmother had purchased for protection against burglars, officials said. The incident occurred during an after-school argument while the two were home alone, police said. The girl had been declared brain-dead following the Monday afternoon incident, but she was on life-support machines at <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. She died after those machines were turned off, hospital officials said. The shooting occurred after the two children returned home from school, according to police in this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, suburb. Police did not release the names of the children. The shooting occurred at the home of the children's grandmother, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bea </PERSON>, where they had moved last year after their parents separated. The incident began when the boy, a second-grader, began playing with a .32 pistol Mrs. <PERSON> Bea </PERSON> kept in a dresser drawer in her bedroom. His sister, who was in the first grade, scolded him for playing with the gun and he responded by shooting her, police said. The shooting occurred after the children had returned home from school, which ended at 1:10 p.m. They were normally alone in the home until 3 p.m., when an uncle came home, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he probably will not file charges against the girl's brother unless it can be proven the attack was deliberate. <PERSON> Horan </PERSON> said police must have evidence that the boy was `` capable of forming criminal intent'' when he pulled the trigger. `` Does he know right from wrong? That would be determined by a lot of things,'' he said. Although the shooting was termed deliberate by police, they were n't sure about the boy's state of mind. `` When we say ` deliberate,' we mean it was not an accidental thing,'' said police spokesman <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>. `` He did point -LRB- the gun -RRB- and he did pull -LRB- the trigger -RRB-. Whether he realized what would happen ... we're just not in a position to say.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bea </PERSON> said she does n't believe her grandson intended to harm his sister. `` As far as I'm concerned, it was an accident,'' she said. `` He's just eight He could n't have known.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bea </PERSON> said she bought the gun 18 months ago for protection against burglars. Neither of the children knew she owned a gun until the boy began rummaging through the dresser drawers after Christmas, <PERSON> Bea </PERSON> said the boy told police.

 Police staged more than 20 raids around the capital Wednesday, seeking evidence connected to an attack on a base that left 36 people dead and at least 68 wounded, Attorney General <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Alessio </PERSON> said. Also Wednesday, President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> signed a decree creating a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to investigate the attack and prevent subversion. <PERSON> Alessio </PERSON> said three of the civilian commandos identified belonged to radical leftist groups, supporting the government's contention that the attack was leftist-inspired. He also said the attackers identified so far are Argentine. In all, 17 men and two women between the ages of 19 and 35 were being held at police headquarters in downtown <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <PERSON> D'Alessio </PERSON> said. A 20th person was hospitalized with wounds and may or may not be involved with the commandos, he said. Previously, the government acknowleged only 14 people were under arrest. He also said the commandos included five women, two of which were killed and three arrested. Shortly after dawn Monday, about 50 heavily armed civilians burst through the main gate at the 3rd infantry regiment at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tablada </LOCATION> on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. By Tuesday afternoon, at least 28 were dead and perhaps 10 others escaped. Seven soldiers and a policeman also were killed, officials said. The attorney general said police raided between 20 and 25 places in the capital and its suburbs as part of an investigation of the base attack. One woman was arrested. <PERSON> D'Alessio </PERSON> declined to give any further details. <PERSON> D'Alessio </PERSON> offered little information about the commandos' motives and ideology, but the identities of three lent support to the position of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> that the group was comprised of radical leftists. Among the dead were <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldu </PERSON>, a former member of the Castro-inspired <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Banos </PERSON>, a leader of a spinoff group known as Movement Everyone for the Country. Banos recently denounced alleged plans by rightists in the military to overthrow the government and install <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>. At least 18 bodies remain to be identified, <PERSON> D'Alessio </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> ERP </ORGANIZATION>, as the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is called by its Spanish acronym, formally disbanded in 1980 after years of battling with soldiers in open clashes, and being decimated in the process. The Movement is a small, little-known organization that includes ex-ERP militants. Under arrest is another Movement leader, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgos </PERSON>. Pamphlets and statements found among the commandos indicated they called themselves the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which government sources say was composed of former members of the <ORGANIZATION> ERP </ORGANIZATION>, the Movement and other groups. The propaganda indicated the commandos saw themselves as acting to prevent an imminent right-wing coup. There was little indication what the group intended to do at the base or achieve by the attack; or whether it had links to similar groups. A congressional source with close ties to the left said the attackers hoped to carry out a lightning raid to demonstrate their militant opposition to right-wing elements in the army and to attract popular support, and that they did not intend a shootout. <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON>, presidential candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, said the government must make sure the attack is an isolated incident and not the leading edge of a wave of attacks like those that plagued the country 15 years ago. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, in a nationwide speech Tuesday night, said resolving the symptoms if not the causes of subversion `` is the last test of my government'' and pledged to establish a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The council, over which <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> personally is to preside, will include the ministers of defense, interior and foreign relations; the heads of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s army, navy and air force, and others the president might choose later. The immediate goals are to figure out what happened in Monday's base attack, determine whether other potential threats exist, develop strategies of prevention and coordinate information <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s election in 1983 replaced a military dictatorship. He will step down in December after national elections in May.

The injured included civilians, <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> police officers and firefighters and at least two were believed to be in serious condition, said Capt. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> said 18 people were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation and the rest were taken to hospitals for treatment of smoke inhalation. The cause of the three-alarm blaze was not immediately known. It began on the second floor of the building's west wing, in a snack bar-souvenir store and storage area, said <PERSON> Efrain </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrilla </PERSON>, a Fire Department spokesman. `` It centered in the ceiling of the storage area for the restaurant,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchese </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The snack bar is located between Gate 33, which was being used by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> at the time of the fire, and Gate 34, which <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> was using, said <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrastia </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> PA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman.

No passengers were aboard the planes but aircraft were moved away from the building during the fire, he said. About 170 firefighters fought the blaze, which was reported at 7:26 p.m. and went to three alarms at 8:21 p.m., said Firefighter <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Foxx </PERSON>, a department spokesman.

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says a survey of the scientific research on abortion suggests that most women suffer no lasting emotional problems from the procedure. `` By and large, what you find is that most of the women who have abortions experience a sense of relief,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, director of public interest legislation at the <ORGANIZATION> APA </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview on Tuesday.

 Officials on Wednesday abandoned hope of finding any more survivors of the earthquake and mudslide that inundated three mountain villages, and said this settlement would be dedicated as a common grave. Along with the bad news that no more survivors could expect to be found, there also was good news: officials said the death toll from Monday's disaster was only about a quarter of the 1,000 they originally had estimated. In addition, a young man described how his 6-day-old cousin miraculously survived the quake, held aloft in her father's hands as he and his household died in a torrent of mud.

 It's seminar season, time for experts and unemployed candidates to talk about overhauling the way Americans nominate and elect their presidents. They'll get scant encouragement from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who won once and lost once under the current system, said he will `` play by the rules until some better ones come along.'' `` I'm not going to spend any time trying to redo it,'' he said in an interview prior to his inauguration. Campaigns grow longer and more costly every time, presidential primary elections multiply, and for a while after each election, there is talk of change in the name of reform. It's been that way since the Democrats began changing the system nearly 20 years ago. That changed the process for Republicans, too, because the primary election laws enacted by state legislatures usually cover both sides. So far, efforts at change have only made campaigns more complex, more expensive and more time-consuming. Long before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been in the White House a year, prospective challengers will be making their first moves toward the 1992 campaign, most of which will have to do with raising money. Step one these days is to set up a political action committee, to bankroll preliminary operations. All told, there were 38 presidential primary elections in 1988. On a single night, Super Tuesday, 20 states _ a dozen of them in the South _ chose nominating delegates by primary or caucus. Democratic re-reformers tried to put more political savvy in their nominating process by guaranteeing party elders and officeholders seats at the Democratic National Convention. But that was scaled back at last summer's convention under pressure from <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who got almost no support from those ex-officio delegates. That was part of a peacemaking package with Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic nominee against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and it illustrates the reality the reformers ca n't alter. The nominating system in both parties bends to accommodate the candidates who master it to gain power. Southern Democrats devised the Super Tuesday notion, which was supposed to give their more conservative constituencies an early and influential voice in the contest for the 1988 Democratic nomination. It sent the party no clear signal _ the path was left open for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But it was a turning point for the <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came close to a sweep. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said early this month that `` the regional concept was ... something new this time ... and it proved to be a tremendous boon for me.'' He said other regions will start looking at alliances that would cluster their primaries to increase their influence. `` The Western states some day are going to get together and say, ` Why should we be left out all the time? Why should n't we get in there and be up front?''' That's occurred to some other regions, too. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> made a stab at it, but wound up as an adjunct to Super Tuesday, in part because <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> was not about to give up its premier primary to enter into a group. There are other proposals for restricting primaries to certain dates so there would be a limited number of election days during the primary season, and by a combination of date and region so that candidates would n't spend so much time traipsing between distant campaign states. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> doubts the revisionists will get far. His skepticism is founded on experience. It happens every fourth year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he'd seen it coming _ `` Everybody's going to go up to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> ... and try to figure out what's wrong with the system `` I do n't think you're going to redesign it,'' he said. And he certainly is n't going to try. `` Why should I go out and say <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s a lousy idea?'' he asked. `` I'm here because of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. ... Not <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in'88, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in'80.'' In 1980, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> upset an absentee <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> precinct caucuses, first event on the presidential campaign calendar. That vaulted him out of the field and ultimately led to his nomination for vice president. In 1988, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was his most severe setback _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ran third. But as vice president he was able to come back quickly. `` You want to get that broad perspective,'' he said, looking back. That perspective comes most readily to winners.

 It is n't hard to understand why many Americans have stopped contributing to their individual retirement accounts in the past couple of years. Since 1987, they have n't been allowed to deduct the contributions on their tax returns if they are covered by a pension plan and have incomes that exceed specified limits _ $ 35,000 for single filers and $ 50,000 for married couples. For those who remain eligible, furthermore, the deduction does n't save as much in taxes under the system of lower tax brackets created by tax reform People in the 15 percent bracket who make $ 2,000 contributions, for example, get only a $ 300 tax break. Non-deductible <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> contributions still are allowed for anyone with income from a job. But non-deductible IRAs have proved to be less than a big hit. That is evidenced by the dropoff that has occurred in <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> promotions by banks and other financial institutions, especially at this time of year. `` A lot of bankers are n't as hot on the account as before tax reform,'' reports the newsletter 100 Highest Yields, which tracks trends in consumer banking. The editors say they have heard reports that `` some outfits wo n't promote their IRAs at all in 1989.'' Analysts who have studied the situation say the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s fall from favor is partly the result of confusion and misunderstanding. They say some people who could still make deductible contributions have the mistaken impression that they no longer can do so. In addition, they observe, savers at all levels often fail to appreciate the power of tax-free compounding, which still applies for all IRAs. And there is an understandable reluctance to tie the money up until age 59 -LCB-, when withdrawals are permitted with no penalty. Even if you decide to make a non-deductible contribution, your resolve may weaken when you confront the paperwork and record-keeping it will require over the years. Once you make a non-deductible contribution, you know that you will someday have non-taxable distributions, assuming that you do n't want to pay taxes on the same money twice That ushers you into the wonderful word of such documents as <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Form 8606, `` Nondeductible IRA Contributions, <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> Basis and Nontaxable IRA Distributions.'' Form 8606 entitles you to spend an extra 28 minutes -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> estimate -RRB- each year wrestling with such demons as: `` 12. Enter total <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> distributions received during 1988. Do not include amounts rolled over before 1-1-89. -LRB- See instructions -RRB-. With all this, though, some advisers on matters of personal finance contend that people who shy away from IRAs may be missing a bet, especially if they are n't taking other, compensating steps to plan for retirement. The arguments about keeping savings liquid and avoiding <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> reporting requirements are `` cogent, but not cogent enough,'' declares <PERSON> Jonathon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pond </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` The tax-deferral feature of IRAs will result in a superior return versus investing outside the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. Quite frankly, we also like the notion of removing retirement-oriented money from temptation's reach `` The onerous <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> reporting requirements can be reduced considerably if only one or a couple of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> accounts are utilized.''

<HEAD>Head Of Bush's Denomination Urges ``Light'' Of Moral Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Quoting Scripture, the preacher put it to the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President this way: `` ` When one rules justly over men, ruling in the fear of God, he dawns on them like the morning light.''' The robed, white-haired clergyman, head of the denomination to which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> belongs, advised him and others that people today `` hunger for moral leadership, and as they are satisfied, they are reconciled to one another.'' The advice came from the Most Rev. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, Presiding Bishop of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, at a special worship service last Sunday attended by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and officials of his new administration. `` Moral leadership is grounded in the inner disposition of love and compassion,'' <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said. `` This inner disposition, nurtured by the Holy Writings and prayer, enables a leader to reach out to tap and release the deep well of justice and compassion in a nation's people.'' In the congregation at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, the Episcopal center in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, were <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s family, his designated Cabinet and staff, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and an ecumenical turnout of religious leaders. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, as the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s primate, is the presiding officer and chief spiritual guide to its 2.8 million members, including <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Moral `` leadership makes conscious that which lies unconscious in the soul of a nation,'' <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said, his gaze roving over that gathering of the powerful. `` From this leadership flows healing and unity of purpose. `` From this leadership emerges national greatness of will and purpose in the exercise of justice and mercy. From this leadership can come the reconciliation of the peoples of the earth. `` When the moral leader shows his inner disposition of love and compassion through his words and actions, the people recognize, acclaim and accept its authority.'' <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> cited <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' Sermon on the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> _ about caring for the poor, the peacemakers, even ememies _ as setting the fundamental standards of `` charity and compassion toward each other.'' `` He helps all people to accept the attributes of a nation that is blessed by God,'' <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said. He said those principles were exemplified in the presidency of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> in the Civil War. Leaders living by those principles pray as <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> did that God's will be done, <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said `` These moral leaders are blessed because they can discern what is good and bad, true and false, corrupt and incorruptible. `` They are blessed because they have internalized the will of God.'' <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> quoted from the book of <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> in which God told ancient <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> David </PERSON> that a just ruler dawns on people `` ` like the morning light, like the sun shining forth upon a cloudless morning, like rain that makes grass to sprout from the earth'.'' The homily was one of three delivered at the special service, culminating a weekend of inaugural events. The other two sermons were by <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>, a layman of the Assemblies of God, and by the Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON>, an American Baptist and minister of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>, preaching on care for God's creation, pointed out that humanity was created from dust. `` That makes dust pretty important,'' he said. `` The elements are not only God's creation, but were chosen by <PERSON> God </PERSON> to represent his own character. We are dust ... Ultimately contamination of the environment is self-contamination.'' Noting that God's first order to <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> was to tend and care for the garden, <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> said `` wrongful use of the garden brought to both <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> and the environment a curse.'' `` We still have the charge to dress the garden and to work it,'' <PERSON> Ashcorft </PERSON> said. `` ... We are stewards of creation, of the very elements from which God chose to create us in his own image. `` Others might think it insignificant, but to those who believe, dust and deity are closely linked ... `` By giving us dominion over the earth ... God has shared with us his role of creator ... In large measure we shape the nature of the world in which we live. We can create communities of pollution or purity _ we make the choice ... `` Fortunately many of our environmental missteps of the past can be redeemed. We have an incredibly wonderful opportunity to correct some of our past errors. To clean them up and start over again.'' <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON> said hope must be restored to the `` destitute of our <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Calcuttas </LOCATION>,'' to `` the prisoners of the inner city,'' to youths, the aged, AIDS sufferers and the `` prisoners of affluence and indifference.'' `` God has ordained governments to be instruments of hope,'' he said. `` In God we trust, but in governments we hope.''

<HEAD>50th Anniversary of World's Most Popular Film</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> is gone and <PERSON> Tara </PERSON>'s a mess, but <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON> still knows one thing: `` Tomorrow is another day.'' `` Gone With the Wind'' was a mess, too, but <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Selznick </PERSON>'s blockbuster _ the world's most popular film _ has been restored and will rise yet again this month for a 50th anniversary tour that's already selling out Since its Dec. 15, 1939, premiere, the popularity of the movie based on <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s novel about the Civil War and Reconstruction has never faltered. It broke box-office records by grossing $ 14 million its first year, and new generations flocked to carefully spaced reissues in 1947, 1954, 1961 and 1967. The 1976 television debut was the largest audience ever to tune in for a theatrical feature, with 33.9 million homes watching. The film has so far grossed $ 76.7 million at the box office, and had been the No. 1 top-grossing movie until `` The Sound of Music'' edged ahead in 1965. A widescreen version made in the 1960s turned `` Gone With the Wind'' into a celluloid mess. The conversion ruined the color and composition of the movie, which had been made in Technicolor. Promoters say the newly restored version brings back the color and majesty of the original. Television entrepreneur <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who owns the film, is planning a 42-city tour in American movie houses for the restored print. The 3 -LCB- - hour film, which won eight Academy Awards including best picture, is already sold out, with tickets at $ 10 and $ 12.50 for the first showing Jan. 30-31 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> The day of its premiere in 1939, the governor declared a holiday and more than a million people crowded into downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vivien </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> led a parade of stars down <LOCATION> Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Loew </PERSON>'s Grand Theater, which was decked out with a white marble facade reminiscent of <PERSON> Tara </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON>'s plantation. They were celebrating the film version of a hometown writer's Pulitzer Prize-winning epic. Turner acquired the rights to the movie in 1985 when he bought <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> with its massive film library for $ 1.5 billion. He daily began showing the <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Selznick </PERSON> blockbuster in 1987 at one of the six theaters at <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the headquarters of his cable-TV empire; a shop in the atrium offers `` GWTW'' memorabilia. He also launched his 24-hour TV channel, <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, with _ you guessed it _ `` Gone With the Wind.'' `` It's his favorite movie,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, so <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> was `` only too happy'' to foot the $ 250,000 bill for the complex restoration process using the original negatives. `` The situation before was that they were making prints from masters that were several stages removed from the original negatives,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` There were prints floating around that were four or five generations removed.'' For the restored version, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> obtained every bit of negative he could in the best possible condition from <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and then printed `` under optimal conditions,'' he said. `` What really comes out is a better print than has ever been seen before, even since'39. They -LRB- <PERSON> Selznick </PERSON>'s crew -RRB- had wonderful equipment for recording and sound, but not as good equipment for printing it.'' Also restored is the original `` sweep'' title, which moved across the screen from right to left in the 1939 version. It had been replaced by a block title, showing all four words at once, in remakes during the 1960s. The anniversary celebration comes just one year before the anticipated publication of the long-awaited sequel to <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s novel After fighting for decades to keep others from continuing the story of <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> estate authorized a sequel in 1987 and last year chose <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> author, to write it. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 4.94 million for the rights to publish the sequel. Turner's staff is putting together events to celebrate the film's 50th anniversary in December `` There will be a ball of some kind'' in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, `` but it's not for sure right now what exactly is going to be done.'' Until Turner bought the rights, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> had few permanent reminders that it was the home of <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who won a Pulitzer Prize for the 1936 novel that has sold 25 million copies. Efforts to save the apartment where she wrote much of the book are tied up in court. The Loew's, which opened as an opera house in 1892, was gutted by fire in 1978. The restored version of `` GWTW'' will be available on videocassette for home use, as will a TBS documentary, `` The Making of a Legend: Gone With the Wind,'' which was produced by <PERSON> Selznick </PERSON>'s sons, <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Selznick </PERSON> The original was released on videocassette in 1985, and has sold more than 500,000 copies at $ 89.95 each in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with similar sales overseas. Initially, 29,000 copies had to be destroyed because they opened with 45 seconds of the wrong music _ a strident marching song. The videos were later re-released with the correct tune, `` Dixie.''

<HEAD>1939 Was a Vintage Year for Movies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In 1939, as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> challenged the German war machine, and Admiral <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> made his third expedition to the icy vastness of <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> went to the movies. And oh, what movies they were. Never had Hollywood seen such a single year, a year bursting with delicious and memorable screen treats, including `` Gone With the Wind,'' `` The Wizard of Oz,'' `` Wuthering Heights'' and `` Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Goes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' It was like dropping a starving child in the middle of an ice cream jungle with 26 flavors dangling from vines. There was <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> riding tall in `` Stagecoach,'' his first major feature. <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberon </PERSON> left audiences breathless as <PERSON> Heathcliff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> in `` Wuthering Heights.'' They were `` torn with desire'' and `` twisted with hate!'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Donat </PERSON> played the shy schoolmaster in the sloshy and sentimental `` Goodbye, Mr. <PERSON> Chips </PERSON>,'' with <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> <PERSON> Garson </PERSON> in her screen debut. Meanwhile, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> tried to inject intelligence, decency and some good old common sense into <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Capra </PERSON>'s `` Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Goes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' -LRB- Smith: `` I would n't give you two cents for all your fancy rules if behind them they did n't have a little bit of plain, ordinary kindness and a little looking out for the other fella.'' -RRB- And there was the timeless fantasy, `` The Wizard of Oz,'' which has touched practically every child in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It was directed by <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, who also was a director on 1939's most spectacular movie, and indeed, one of the most popular films of all time, `` Gone With the Wind,'' which won eight Academy Awards. It was a time when more than 50 percent of the population regularly went to the cinema, and more than 500 pictures came out each year. It was a time when Americans talked about going to `` the movies.'' Today, one goes to see _ with any luck _ `` a movie.'' And that one movie might be only 90 minutes long and not very good. In 1939, when the studio system was at its height, churning out motion pictures to satisfy a moviegoing public, magic came to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. How such grand movies all came out at the same time and managed to survive the years and become among the best ever made is as magical as <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>'s trip to Oz. <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had four hits that year: `` Juarez,'' with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Muni </PERSON>, <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Rains </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON>; `` The Old Maid,'' with <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brent </PERSON>; `` The Private Lives of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION>,'' with <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Havilland </PERSON>; and the three-hanky `` Dark Victory,'' with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> and <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>. She received an Oscar nomination for her role in the last of these as <PERSON> Judith </PERSON>, the society girl who is dying of a brain tumor: `` Nothing can hurt us now. What we have ca n't be destroyed. That's our victory _ our victory over the dark It is a victory because we're not afraid.'' `` The Women,'' based on <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Luce </PERSON>'s stage comedy, featured an all-female cast which included <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>. Other star vehicles included <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lubitsch </ORGANIZATION> sparkling confection, `` Ninotchka.'' The comedy was a departure for the oh-so-serious <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON> and one studio hypesters proclaimed, `` <PERSON> Garbo </PERSON> laughs!'' The leggy and sultry <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON> changed Westerns forever in `` Destry Rides Again.'' Said one critic: `` <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON> standing on a bar in black net stockings belting out ` See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have' was a greater work of art than the <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Milo </PERSON>.'' Somewhat less flashy _ and fleshy _ was <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> in the romance, `` Love Affair,'' with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>; <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> in `` Drums Along the Mohawk''; the <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> production of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s `` Of Mice and Men,'' with <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lon </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>; <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Niven </PERSON> and <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> in `` The Real Glory,'' a tale of soldiers of fortune; and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Steven </PERSON>'s treatment of the Rudyard Kipling poem, `` Gunga Din. <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaglen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> starred as `` the stalwart, lusty, swaggering sergeants three.'' The year gave film fans `` Babes in Arms,'' `` Intermezzo,'' `` <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Geste </PERSON>,'' `` The Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' `` The Man in the Iron Mask'' and `` The Rains Came,'' an almost forgotten disaster spectacular set in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> during the days of the Raj. It starred <PERSON> Myrna </PERSON> <PERSON> Loy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> and received an Oscar nomination for <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s musical score. Finally, it was another grand year for those classic clowns, <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>. Their <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> romp, `` Chump at <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>,'' had some of the most memorable comic bits in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> history: the butler and maid routine and <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION>'s impersonation of <LOCATION> Lord </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paddington </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Groucho As Rhett and Other Important Factoids</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> with a wide, painted-on mustache, meandering eyebrows, eye glasses and a cigar? Well, if author <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> had her way and had been really serious about it, it would have been <PERSON> Groucho </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> who swept Miss <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> up all those stairs for a taste of Southern lust instead of <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>. With all the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> hype to recruit stars for `` Gone With the Wind,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning best seller, kept her distance because she feared fellow Southerners would blame her if the movie did n't turn out well. She did n't want to help write the script, would n't participate in the casting search for stars and finally coughed up her own candidate: the ribald comic. As one of the most popular movies of all time, `` Gone With the Wind'' is awash with such nuggets. Did you know, for example, that the winner of eight Academy Awards was panned by some critics? `` A major event in the history of the industry but only a minor event in motion picture art. There are moments when the two categories meet on good terms, but the long stretches between are filled with mere spectacular efficiency,'' wrote <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoellering </PERSON> in The Nation. `` Shakespeare's ` The Taming of the Shrew' seems to have gotten mixed up with one of the novels of <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dell </PERSON>,'' wrote <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Agate </PERSON>. Here are some other `` Gone With the Wind'' factoids: _ Two soundtracks were released with the 1939 film _ one for domestic distribution and one for overseas. In the international version there was strident marching music and the visual was an elaborate description of the North-South conflict. The domestic version had a sweet version of `` Dixie'' and talked about the halcyon days in the South that are gone with the wind. _ With all the Oscars the movie copped, there was one significant omission: <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>. He lost out to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Donat </PERSON> for his performance in `` Goodbye, Mr. Chips.'' _ <PERSON> Hattie </PERSON> <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON>, who won an Academy Award for supporting actress for her role as the maid <PERSON> Mammy </PERSON>, kept her long, manicured fingernails in the movie as her own way of protesting the treatment of blacks in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. She was not, she wanted the world to know, a maid. She was the first black actor ever nominated for an Oscar and the first to ever win. _ <PERSON> Vivien </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> refused to have any embraces with <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> when they first began shooting the movie because of a foul mouth odor caused by his dentures. He eventually remedied the problem. _ <PERSON> Cammie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, who portrayed <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blue </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON>'s little girl, could n't stop blinking while playing dead so a mask of her face was made and used over her real face. Also, it was n't the actress who fell from the pony but a midget. And a blue-eyed boy played <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blue </PERSON> as an infant. _ Scenes of the <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> plantation and the burning of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> were filmed at the backlot of <ORGANIZATION> Laird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON>, the movie's costume designer, was given a box of thorns by a woman in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, because during the Civil War, there were no metal pins and clothing was held together by the thorns. _ The structure which collapses in flames during the burning of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> had also been the Temple of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in `` King of Kings'' and the native village in `` King Kong.'' _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Cukor </PERSON> began as director of the movie but <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> complained that he favored the female actresses. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Menzies </PERSON> also had directorial stints on the epic.

<HEAD>Tiny Swamp Town Fighting Closure Of School, Center Of Community Life</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FARGO, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The people of this swampside settlement have shunned formal government since the days when it was a logging camp, taking their problems and projects instead to town meetings at the schoolhouse. The school has held the town together, but now it appears headed for closure and residents fear its demise will mean the end of <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> just when the community is on the rebound. The 250 or so residents are taking on the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> to try to keep the state's smallest elementary school open. The odds are n't great, but the odds have been bad before and <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON> is still on most maps. `` Fargo is a can-do town, it's the way towns used to be,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Oettmeier </PERSON>, a native son. `` It might take an act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to keep our school. And there's not but 58 -LRB- students -RRB- and we know that. But if we lose the school, it wo n't be our fault,'' said <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Leviton </PERSON>, a school board member. Fargo lies on the edge of the <LOCATION> Okefenokee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Swamp </LOCATION>, just where the <LOCATION> Suwanee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> _ </LOCATION> <LOCATION> THE </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Suwanee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> _ crawls out of the bog and heads south in no great hurry past <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. The songwriter who made the river famous, people in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> say, apparently never laid eyes on it. Not that there's much to see. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Highway 89 barely slows down through the cluster of modest homes and small stores. Unincorporated since it was a logging camp at the turn of the century, <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON> has had little to do with governments _ residents often pass the hat when the town needs something _ and governments have returned the favor. Nothing but pine trees will grow in the sandy, acid soil around the Okefenokee where a `` hill'' is any land with no standing water on it. In a disastrous fire 33 years ago, tens of thousands of acres of pines burned. But the trees were replanted and are becoming marketable. Now there is serious talk of a new mill, of more jobs so more people can stay in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>. `` We've spent 33 years trying to come back and the <ORGANIZATION> QBE </ORGANIZATION> is hitting this little place in the head just when it's trying to recover,'' said <PERSON> Oettmeier </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pine </ORGANIZATION>, which leases more than 200,000 acres of pine around <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> to Champion Lumber Co. Under <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s Quality Basic Education law, a reform package passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, smaller school districts are being encouraged to consolidate isolated schools. The Fargo school was built in 1952 for several times the current enrollment. But as loggers cut the trees the fire missed, people began to dribble out of <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>. Clinch County operates the school, with its six teachers and one principal, on the $ 200,000 a year it gets in state `` sparsity grants.'' As things stand, that will be cut in half next year and then end. <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON>, the state has decided, does n't qualify for the grants, though for some children who live in its outer reaches the round trip to school in <LOCATION> Homerville </LOCATION> will mean nearly 100 miles a day on a school bus. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornhill </PERSON>, director of facilities and transportation for the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, said that to qualify there must be no way the schools can be consolidated. Only a few meet that standard, he said, and consolidation is becoming common across rural <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. If the grant stops, it will be up to <LOCATION> Clinch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to decide whether to consolidate or use local funds to keep the school open. `` That is not really within the realm of possibilities,'' said county School Superintendent <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. `` This is a rural county that is losing jobs and losing people and for us to take over the cost is out of the question.'' Clinch County raises less than a quarter of its annual $ 4.7 million school budget locally. It would have to raise local school taxes by some 25 percent to handle the $ 200,000 annual Fargo costs. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said the concern over <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON>'s fate is very real, `` but the board of education's primary function is to educate children, not preserve towns.'' `` If there is no school, -LRB- the lumber company -RRB- is going to want to know about it now,'' <PERSON> Oettmeier </PERSON> said. `` They're not going to build a $ 40 million mill where nobody wants to work and live.'' Town leaders are lobbying state officials to try to keep the funding that will let the school remain open, and say they have some support. It may not be enough, many in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> realize, to save a way of life they cherish. At the school, kids do n't lock their bikes. If a kid rode down the street on somebody else's bike, the whole town would know. On a recent afternoon dogs waited outside a classroom for their young owners, and if one poked a nose in an open doorway, that was OK. In <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, people know whose dog is whose. <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON> residents say it is this closeness and tranquility that makes them want to stay, raise families and pursue values that are endangered elsewhere, even if they have to travel 28 miles to the nearest pharmacy and most go to <LOCATION> Valdosta </LOCATION>, 50 miles west, to see a doctor or dentist. For a time the nearest fire engine was in <LOCATION> Homerville </LOCATION>, so Fargo residents raised the money themselves to refurbish an old, donated engine. They passed the hat to air-condition the school and to build a ballpark, complete with lights. <LOCATION> Homerville </LOCATION> teams played night games in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> while waiting for a government grant to get a lighted park of their own, Oettmeier notes. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, 25, who returned to his hometown to teach kindergarten and first grade, said all the town's activities are centered at the school. `` The senior citizens have their programs here, the first aid and first response groups meet here. So do the Boy Scouts and the <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION>.'' The school hosts the community Christmas program. Gift baskets are distributed from the school to the less fortunate. `` It all happens from the school,'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said. `` If the school closes, the town will close.''

 The stock market surged broadly higher Tuesday, pushing the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average for the first time back to the levels it held just before the October 1987 market crash. The Dow average of 30 industrial stocks finished up 38.04 points at 2,256.43. It was the highest close for the widely followed market indicator since it finished at 2,246.73 on Oct. 16, 1987, the last session before the infamous Black Monday crash of Oct. 19, when the average plummeted an unprecedented 508 points in a single day. Market watchers said investor optimism about the outlook for interest rates fueled Tuesday's rally, which followed a 17-point drop in the Dow average on Monday. Analysts said investors were reassured by comments from <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who said he was satisfied with <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy to keep interest rates on the tight side in order to hold down inflation. In the long run, analysts said, that policy could prevent a sustained bout of higher rates. Stocks also were supported by rises in the dollar and bond prices, market watchers said.

 A month after <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to plead guilty to felony charges, federal prosecutors have revealed the allegations include crooked dealings with disgraced stock speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and a defunct securities firm. But the disclosure of the six specific mail and securities fraud counts Tuesday still leaves unanswered questions: _ What will be required of the investment giant to keep its plea bargain, which includes an agreement to pay a records $ 650 million in fines and restitution; _ When will <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> actually plead guilty, and _ What effect will the agreement have on the fate of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s embattled `` junk bond'' chief The charges against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> were revealed in a court document known as an information, which is presented to a judge or magistrate when a defendant agrees to waive indictment and settle a case without going to trial. A lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> entered a `` not guilty'' plea before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershon </PERSON>, because only a judge can take a guilty plea to a felony. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s guilty plea would not come until after the settlement is approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Key details of the settlement spelling out <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s responsibilities concerning cooperation with investigators and other issues was kept under seal at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s request, however <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said he believed the public had a right to know details of the agreement and he would ask a federal judge to unseal details of the settlement at a closed hearing today. `` I can not answer for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> why they want to keep it under seal,'' said <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who added: `` the public in general, but in particular, the investing public, is entitled to the facts about the case.'' In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said it `` will not comment further regarding other criminal allegations that have been a part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's investigation.'' The government accused <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> of criminal acts ranging from insider trading to stock manipulation involving some recent major takeover targets as well as <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which liquidated after five of its top officials were indicted last year on racketeering charges. In all, there were four counts of securities fraud and two of mail fraud in the information. `` There are no specific insider trading charges among the six counts enumerated,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, `` but the information does describe the course of conduct between <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> organization and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the Princeton-Newport organization and in connection with them, the information does allege insider trading.'' Some of the charges also implicated a senior employee at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s High Yield and <ORGANIZATION> Convertible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, identified only as `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said he was `` not permitted'' by federal rules to identify the individual. People familiar with the case concluded the employee was <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s senior junk bond financier who is expected to be indicted shortly on fraud and racketeering charges. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> declined to comment on any possible charges facing <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who has maintained he has done nothing wrong. Five of the charges in the criminal case mirrored accusations in a civil case leveled against the firm and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> in September by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, which said they schemed with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the now-imprisoned stock speculator who has snitched on many prominent securities figures in exchange for lenient treatment. The sixth charge involved a transaction that allegedly defrauded a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> client. `` <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> manipulated securities prices, engaged in insider trading and unlawfully facilitated merger and acquisition activities,'' said a statement from <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s office. `` Today's filing of an information charging <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> is in accordance with the preliminary agreement reached with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION> on Dec. 21, 1988,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s statement `` We believe that this settlement is in the best interests of our firm, its employees and clients.'' The statement also said the settlement, when final, `` will protect <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> from further prosecution relating to the matters which are part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office's continuing investigation.'' The charges accused <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> of mail fraud and securities fraud in connection with takeover-related transactions that included targets <ORGANIZATION> Fischbach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graphics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The firm also was accused of fraud in connection with a transaction in which the government said it conspired with <PERSON> Princeton-Newport </PERSON> to cheat a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> client, <ORGANIZATION> C.O.M.B. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is the fifth-largest Wall Street firm and one of the most profitable investment concerns in the country It is a leader in the $ 175 billion market for `` junk bond'' securities, often used to finance takeovers and the growth of small to medium sized companies. The firm and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> were implicated in extensive wrongdoing by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> after he turned state's evidence in late 1986. In December, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> began negotiating a plea deal with <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s office in order to avoid crippling charges of racketeering. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> continues to maintain his innocence.

 Companies making cars and light trucks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reported sales dropped 11.5 percent in mid-January compared with unusually strong results last year. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> all reported double-digit sales declines, led by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s 21.9 percent drop and followed by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s 13.6 percent decline and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s 10 percent fall. The seven companies making cars in this country reported Tuesday they sold vehicles at a daily rate of 28,584 during the Jan. 11-20 period this year compared with an average daily rate of 32,292 during the same time last year. But last year's numbers were unusually high, said analyst <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` Last January was the highest seasonally adjusted -LRB- sales -RRB- rate in the last 20 years,'' she said. `` And it will continue into February, too.'' During the first part of last year, automakers were worried about the fallout from the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash. To bolster sales, they put incentives on their vehicles, a move that may have proven unnecessary. `` The automakers did n't really realize that the underlying demand was there,'' <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> said. `` So, consumers were going to buy anyway and then the incentives pushed them up more.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers said they sold cars at a daily rate of 17,330 during the period this year, compared with a daily rate of 20,709 during the same time last year. There were nine selling days in both periods. Sales of U.S.-made light trucks dropped 2.8 percent in mid-January to a daily rate of 11,254 from a rate of 11,583 during the same time last year. During the first two 10-day periods this year, sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks were down 5.2 percent, to a daily rate of 27,288 from a rate of 28,775 last year. There were 16 sales days in both periods. Among the Big Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> car sales dropped 21.9 percent in mid-January to a daily rate of 7,861 from a 10,066 rate during the same period last year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s light trucks sold at a 4,306 daily rate during the Jan. 11-20 period this year, down 4 percent from 4,488 daily during the same time last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> cars sold at a daily rate of 5,842 during the period this year, down 13.6 from a rate of 6,766 last year. Ford light trucks sold at a rate of 3,968 during mid-January this year, down 5.5 percent from a rate of 4,202 during the period last year. Cars sales by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> dropped 10 percent during mid-January this year, to a daily rate of 2,462 from a rate of 2,736 last year. Light trucks sold at a daily rate of 2,634 this year, up 0.8 percent from the 2,613 rate during the period last year.

<HEAD>Cellular Phone Industry Settles Disagreement Over Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The booming cellular phone industry has settled on a transmission standard for the future that should keep the airwaves from getting clogged with busy signals. The agreement, announced on Tuesday, sets a standard for the digital cellular phones that are expected to begin appearing in 1991. A digital system can handle many more calls in the limited frequency band that is available because calls can be `` compressed'' by computers. At a meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said its board of directors had on Monday unanimously endorsed a decision reached last week by the standard-setting <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Cellular phones, typically used in cars, are actually radio receivers and transmitters. Calls are sent to central offices, where they plug into the regular phone network. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are already running up against capacity with the current system. In addition to providing more capacity, a digital system will be more secure because calls will be harder to intercept. Initially it will be more expensive, but costs will come down because of the greater efficiency of digital technology. The standards setters agreed that digital calls would be funneled onto channels using a technique known as time-division multiplexing. The alternative standard, which had been supported by <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is known as frequency division multiplexing. The standards setters decided that time-division multiplexing had more potential for future growth. Although the decision went against them, <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> said they were pleased with the agreement because it would allow the industry to move forward. `` We feel that this is a very positive step,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Several other decisions on standards remain to be made, but this was a major one. `` This decision needed to be made before any other decisions could be made in the digital standards process,'' <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The voting members of her association are operators of cellular phone systems. The standard-setting <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, in contrast, comprises both system operators and equipment manufacturers.

<HEAD>Polaroid Rejects Shamrock's $45-a-Share Offer; Proxy Fight Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The stage is set for <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> to wage a proxy fight for control of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> after the camera maker rejected <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s $ 3.2 billion buyout bid, calling it indadequate. The uninvited bid turned down Tuesday was made last week when <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, a television and radio concern owned by the <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> family, raised its offer to $ 45 per share for all <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stock, including 9.7 million shares issued under <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s employee stock ownership plan. The previous offer of $ 2.6 billion, or $ 42 per share, did not include the employee shares. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> called the latest sweetened offer `` inadequate from a financial point of view and not in the best interest of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> and its stockholders, except <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> and its affiliate.'' `` Polaroid's board strongly recommends that stockholders reject the Shamrock offer and not tender any of their shares of common stock,'' Polaroid stated. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 12 -LCB- cents a share to $ 40 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, a Shamrock spokesman, said the <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, Calif.-based company would proceed with its plan to nominate a slate of candidates for election to <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s board at the company's annual meeting May 9. If elected, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s candidates would be committed to selling the company either under <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s offer or to any third party who made a higher bid. Shamrock President <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said he was disappointed by <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection of <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s $ 45 per share offer. In a prepared statement issued from <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said: `` We intend to vigorously pursue our tender offer and our previously announced plans to wage a proxy contest for control of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> if our tender offer is not consummated prior to <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s May annual meeting.'' <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> declined comment on <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s proposed proxy challenge. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> said when it extended its offer Jan. 19 that about 13.1 million Polaroid shares, or 18.3 percent of the outstanding stock, had been tendered and not withdrawn. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s tender offer expires March 15, and is contingent on obtaining at least 90 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s 71.6 million outstanding shares. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s management could be forced into a leveraged buyout to thwart <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s takeover attempt. In a leveraged buyout, a group usually finances its bid by borrowing heavily against the assets of the company being acquired. `` My guess is that the next time <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> is forced to extend its offer, that the number of tendered shares will probably move up to close to 25 million,'' he said. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said 25 million tendered shares, nearly 35 percent of the outstanding shares, combined with the 6.9 million Shamrock already holds could frighten <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> executives into financing a leveraged buyout to avoid having sell the company to <LOCATION> Shamrock </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> has been resisting <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> since July, when <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> offered $ 40 per share in a friendly but unsolicited bid. Polaroid is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> is appealing a <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling upholding the employee stock ownership plan. The <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled a March 16 hearing on the appeal. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> contends the employee stock was issued to block a takeover. If it is invalidated, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> has promised to raise its offer to $ 3.36 billion, or $ 47 per share. The stock plan owns about 14 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. It makes a takeover extremely difficult because under <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law, a hostile suitor must gain at least 85 percent of its target to proceed with a takeover.

<HEAD>Greenspan Comments Boost Stock Market</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: May be led with existing home sales reports scheduled for mid-morning
release.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> says the risk of inflation is great enough to keep boosting interest rates to restrict growth, and his comments were credited with helping fuel rallies in stocks and bonds. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 38.04 points on Tuesday to finish at 2,256.43, closing above its pre-Black Monday level for the first time since the October 1987 crash. After closing at 2,246.74 on Oct. 16, 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrials lost an unprecedented 508 points in the Black Monday market collapse on Oct. 19. Testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> warned that strains on factory capacity and a tight labor market, particularly in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, likely would keep inflation pressures high, so the central bank's monetary policy should continue on the tight side. `` The long-run costs of a return to higher inflation, and the risks of this occurring under current circumstances, are sufficiently great that <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> policy at this juncture might well be advised to err more on the side of restrictiveness than of stimulus,'' he said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he wants to keep a lid on economic growth and continue to slowly boost interest rates to avoid higher inflation, which was 4.4 percent in 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, reported that wage gains of 4.1 percent last year lagged behind inflation rate while employment costs, at 5 percent, rose faster than inflation. Wage and salary gains are closely watched as signals of a possible inflationary spiral. The increase for 1988 was much closer to inflation than the 3.3 percent wage hike reported for 1987. The Labor Department figures indicated that continued low unemployment has forced employers to compete for available workers, often by increasing pay. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the unemployment rate, at 5.3 percent in December, has hit a 14-year low, well within the range of what most economists consider to be the natural rate of unemployment, leaving little room for further improvement without inflation. In other economic news Tuesday, automakers reported that sales of U.S.-made cars in mid-January plummeted 16.3 percent _ led by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s 21.9 percent decline _ from a relatively strong year-earlier period. A year ago, automakers were offering some buyer incentives amid continued uneasiness about the strength of the automobile market following the stock market crash. Eventually, the concern about the market proved to be unwarranted as automakers posted the third-best model year in history in 1988.

The dollar's higher opening followed a remark Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> that he would tighten monetary policy to fight inflation. After buying the dollar in early trading, speculative investors then started selling the currency for position adjustments, said <PERSON> Takamasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamasaki </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` We already knew that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would tighten its monetary policy and keep interest rates high, but <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s comment still prompted the buying because Japanese investors have been looking for market-affecting incentives,'' he added Higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates tend to make the dollar more attractive to foreign investors. Other dealers said investors were reluctant to push the dollar higher for fear of another round of dollar-selling intervention by central banks. Meanwhile, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 31,567.79, a new high just 10.11 points, or 0.03 percent, higher than the previous record of 31,557.68, set on Tuesday. The index's rally in early trading followed rising prices on overseas markets overnight. It began falling as investors grew concerned about the index's rapid increase, but managed to keep the marginal gain, said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Trading became directionless as investors floated from one issue to another while trying to keep the index from rising too high, said the dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Investors are expecting the Nikkei to rise continuously, but they get cautious if prices rise too quickly,'' the dealer said. He predicted that the Nikkei would continue upward in view of recent stability in foreign exchange rates and oil prices.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar edged up against most major currencies in light European trading early today, spurred by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s declaration to fight inflation. Gold prices fell. Dealers said the dollar's surge could prompt renewed dollar-selling by central banks, and said fear of intervention was already preventing the dollar from rising faster. `` The market is waiting to see whether the central banks come in,'' said a dealer at a bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that the risks of inflation were great enough that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> `` might well be advised to err more on the side of restrictiveness than of stimulus.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.70 Japanese yen to a closing 127.65 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it slipped back to 127.55 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.8414 West German marks, up from 1.8395; 1.5640 Swiss francs, up from 1.5523; 6.2660 French francs, up from 6.2335; 2.0760 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0680; 1,347.25 Italian lire, up from 1,340.50; 1.1828 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1866 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.7710 from $ 1.7700 late Tuesday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 404.80 a troy ounce, down from $ 407 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 404.75 In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 404.60, down from $ 407.10 bid late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Exchange Says It Won't Tolerate Corruption; Grand Jury Assembled</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, one of two exchanges targeted in a federal probe of corruption in the pits, issued a warning against rules violations to members and traders as many were summoned before a grand jury. Top officials at the exchange distributed a letter Tuesday saying, `` We will never tolerate violations of our rules and regulations and have always aggressively prosecuted those who have broken our rules.'' The <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> _ the nation's largest commodities exchanges _ are at the center of an investigation into allegations that up to 100 brokers and traders cheated customers out of millions of dollars <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents posing as traders wore hidden tape recorders to document alleged wrongdoing in the crowded, frantic trading pits. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> warned Tuesday of serious consequences from the two-year investigation. `` These are not just <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> markets _ these are world markets and these are my markets,'' White, a <LOCATION> Kane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grain farmer, said in a telephone news conference. `` The public must feel that traders on the floor of the exchanges are working honestly and in an open environment.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday subpoenaed clearing firms that serve the exchanges, while a federal grand jury was assembled to begin hearing testimony from traders subpoenaed last week, according to defense attorneys. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said at least 200 subpoenas were issued as part of `` Operation Sourmash,'' and some of the recipients were: <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horberg </PERSON>, a former co-head of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s powerful yen futures committee; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, a major soybean broker; and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>, a soybean trader who sold his <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> seat last week for $ 415,000. Subpoenas were also delivered to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I hope it's only a fishing expedition,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandner </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> RB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> H </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which also was served. `` I would not want to believe there's such widespread corruption that would require such a widespread investigation.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to comment on the latest developments. Clearing firms, which must own seats to do business, are among the exchange's largest members. They have authority to handle retail orders and contract out the physical trading of those orders in the pit to independent traders, also known as locals. A <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, said exchange officials had no idea how many of the exchange's 81 clearing firms were subpoenaed. `` <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> officials were informed that many of the <ORGANIZATION> CME </ORGANIZATION> clearing member firms have been served with subpoenas to provide various records relating to trading activity on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> said. The statement said the subpoenas `` do not imply that the firms ... or their officers are targets of the investigation, or are suspected of any wrongful actions.'' The <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> are marketplaces in which buyers and sellers essentially bet millions of dollars on the future prices of financial instruments and commodities, such as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills or soybeans. The Board of Trade's letter, signed by <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON>, chairman of the board at the exchange, and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, said: `` If any members have taken part in trading practices which are illegal or violate our rules and regulations they are not representative of the 3,500 members of the CBOT.''

<HEAD>Kirkland Says Deficit Panel Hobbled by Lack of Bush Commitment</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will be remembered as a `` missed opportunity'' in deficit-reduction efforts because it lacks the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> commitment necessary to negotiate a settlement, a panel member says. `` I think it had the potential of being a worthwhile exercise -LRB- but -RRB- I think up to now at least a couple of the essential ingredients of an important role for the commission are lacking,'' <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said Tuesday. The panel has been meeting since last May and is scheduled to submit a report to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by March 1. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided against extending the deadline six months. `` The prospects of a unified report, I think, are doubtful but I do n't want to make any premature judgments,'' said <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, one of 14 members of the panel. Missing, he said, was a commitment from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and to a lesser extent congressional leaders, that the commission's work would be seriously considered and that the panel would be used as a forum to find a compromise among various deficit-reduction proposals. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said such a commitment and a sense of urgency were essential to the work of a 1982-83 commission that studied the Social Security system. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> also served on that panel. `` Those were the circumstances that I think were necessary for this committee to serve its purpose,'' he said. `` They may yet evolve, I do n't write off that possibility, but as yet it's not visible.'' Asked who was to blame, <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said: `` I would suppose if you want to lay it at the door of any one factor it is the constraints that have been expressed by the president, both before his election and since, as to the options that were available to deal with the problem. ... He seems preferenced to advance his own programs, his commitment to the so-called flexible freeze.'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, during a meeting with reporters at his office, said congressional leaders also have not given the commission the stature it needs to convince the various interest groups involved in deficit-reduction efforts to make concessions. `` Absent that, you see, members of the commission, certainly like myself, find no real reason to yield on any of our positions,'' he said. `` If there were serious negotiations with the major players and the ultimate package or the ultimate shape of the resolution were otherwise acceptable, as a citizen and as a patriot and as one concerned with resolving it, I'd be disposed to go along with some things that might otherwise prove distasteful.''

 Trader <PERSON> Vic </PERSON>'s, that citadel of ersatz Polynesian cuisine whose defenders include former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, has gotten `` tacky'' and has no place in the Plaza Hotel, Plaza owner <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who recently bought the Plaza, wants to revamp the hotel into a five-star institution and says the restaurant _ with its thatched roofs and dugout canoes _ `` does not fit in with the image of the hotel I want to achieve.'' So instead of a Polynesian-style bar where customers could order a Samoan Fog Cutter or a Dr. <PERSON> Funk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION>, there'll be a health club and a restaurant serving Japanese and Chinese food. But, perhaps to console patrons who feel they've been forsaken, there'll be a bar, run by <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, that will serve tropical drinks. That's small consolation to such loyal patrons as <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, who dined there while president in 1972. `` My entire family will be very sorry to see it close,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said Tuesday through a spokesman. `` It was always our daughters' favorite restaurant, and it quickly became mine, too. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who bought the Plaza last year for $ 390 million, said construction on the Oriental restaurant and the health club will start in about three or four months. The restaurant section of Trader <PERSON> Vic </PERSON>'s, which has been in the Plaza basement for 25 years, has been closed for more than year. But the bar has remained open. <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, a Trader <PERSON> Vic </PERSON>'s spokesman, said the company wants to run the new Oriental restaurant at the hotel but noted that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has `` no intention of keeping Trader <PERSON> Vic </PERSON>'s'' at the Plaza. `` The Trumps want to get a new looking restaurant and that is also what we want,'' <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> said. `` Sure, Trader <PERSON> Vic </PERSON>'s has gotten tacky, but that's because nothing has been done to it in 12 years.'' Trader <PERSON> Vic </PERSON>'s, which began in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, still has more than 20 restaurants across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The president of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, citing wavering confidence in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodity markets, is urging a speedy conclusion to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe of alleged fraud at the city's two futures exchanges. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> warned of serious consequences from a prolonged probe of allegations that as many as 100 traders and brokers at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> defrauded customers of millions of dollars. `` These are not just <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> markets _ these are world markets and these are my markets,'' White, a <LOCATION> Kane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grain farmer, said Tuesday in a telephone news conference. `` The public must feel that traders on the floor of the exchanges are working honestly and in an open environment,'' he said. Some grain and livestock farmers use the futures markets to guarantee prices for the crops and herds they are raising by entering into contracts for future delivery of their products at a specified price. Futures prices also influence cash prices for the commodities. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said confidence in the integrity of the futures industry was crucial to farmers' participation in the markets. Farmers also must have trust in the independent traders who create liquidity in the market by accepting producers' risks in hope of making a profit. `` That confidence has been diminished by the current probe,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` Our analysts feel that liquidity has already been diminished.'' He said it was too early to know whether the growing scandal had set back the efforts of some farm leaders to encourage farmers to use the futures markets. `` If the investigation uncovers a major violation, it's a major setback,'' he said. `` If it turns out to be nitpicking ... I think it would be a short-term thing that can be overcome.''

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> today rejected opposition calls for him to quit after a third member of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> resigned over links to a company at the center of a stock-trading scandal. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced the resignations of its two top bureaucrats who also have been linked to the company. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, scheduled to travel to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in a week for a meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, was hit Tuesday with the resignation of <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Harada </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post of director general of the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Harada </PERSON>, 69, had been appointed Dec. 27 when <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> brought 15 new faces into his scandal-plagued administration in an effort to erase the taint of money links to the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information-based conglomerate. But <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s justice minister, <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>, resigned after only three days and now <PERSON> Harada </PERSON> has quit. In the case of both men, news reports had revealed that they continued to take political donations from Recruit months after the scandal became front-page news last summer. In December, <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> resigned as finance minister after having repeatedly changed his story on how an aide used his name to buy shares in the Recruit subsidiary. The largest opposition party, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, ended its three-day convention today with a resolution to try to force <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to hold new elections. Asked about opposition calls for him to resign and call early elections, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told Japanese reporters: `` That's a matter for me to judge.'' He said he was `` resolved to cope'' with an expected difficult legislature when the Diet, or parliament, convenes next month to debate the government's proposed budget of $ 471.95 billion. Scandal has dogged the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> since an ever-widening web of dubious money links began to emerge between <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and prominent people in politics, business and the news media. The company had offered prelisted shares in a real-estate subsidiary to the prominent people at bargain prices, and they profited handsomely by selling after the shares went on the market in October 1986. At least 16 top politicians, including some in opposition parties, acknowledged that they or their aides benefited in such deals. The transactions were not illegal under Japanese securities law. But they raised suspicions of bribery and influence-peddling and focused public attention on the close links between business and politics. Further revelations have shown that Recruit also made regular donations to many politicians. Several members of the serving Cabinet have explained that they stopped accepting Recruit money after the scandal broke. But the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported Tuesday that <PERSON> Harada </PERSON> had received $ 80 a month from Recruit for 14 years until November, even though he had become chairman of a special parliamentary committee examining the Recruit scandal. The newspaper also reported that Recruit bought $ 8,000 worth of tickets to a <PERSON> Harada </PERSON> fund-raising party in August. In his resignation statement, <PERSON> Harada </PERSON> acknowledged receiving donations but denied the company had sought any favors or that he had done anything wrong. At the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> today, Vice Labor Minister <PERSON> Yoshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Okai </PERSON> and <PERSON> Masayuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomiyama </PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, resigned. Although both had acknowledged accepting favors from Recruit _ dinners in expensive restaurants and golf outings _ the ministry said the resignations were routine personnel changes and not related to the scandal. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has responsibility for supervising Recruit's major line of business in the personnel and employment-information fields, and is being investigated by prosecutors for possible bribery

<HEAD>Quarterly Earnings Up Half-Percent At Unisys; Prime, Apollo Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it managed a half-percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings to end what it called `` a tougher year than we and most of the industry originally expected.'' Among other computer makers, <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it lost money in the quarter because of a one-time charge, and <ORGANIZATION> Apollo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it managed a profit after two quarters of losses. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third-largest computer company, said its quarterly earnings edged up to $ 218 million, or $ 1.05 per share, from last year's figures of $ 216.9 million, or $ 1.09 per share. Revenue for the fourth quarter was up slightly over the same period last year _ to $ 2.87 billion from $ 2.8 billion. For all of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> said net income rose 18 percent to $ 680.6 million, or $ 3.27 per share, from last year's figure of $ 578 million, or $ 2.93 per share. Revenue rose to $ 9.9 billion for the year from 1987's figure of $ 9.71 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, which has headquarters in <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, said it expected its earnings in the current quarter `` will be very weak'' because of lower production levels, inventory reduction programs and the transition to a new line of mainframe computers. Prime, the <LOCATION> Natick </LOCATION>, Mass.-based minicomputer company, said a pre-tax charge of $ 45 million in the fourth quarter produced a net loss of 14.4 million, compared with a profit of $ 21.3 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped 61 percent to $ 431 million from $ 267 million a year earlier because of the Feb. 5, 1988, acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Prime's one-time charge covered costs for a reorganization and cuts of 1,200 jobs as well as the expense of fighting off an ongoing takeover attempt by <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> Without the charge, earnings would have been $ 18.4 million. For the full year, Prime said its earnings after the one-time charge fell to $ 19 million, or 39 cents a share, from $ 64.8 million, or $ 1.32 a share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped to $ 1.59 billion from $ 960 million. Apollo, the computer workstation maker based in <LOCATION> Chelmsford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said it earned $ 3.2 million, or 9 cents a share, in its fourth quarter, helped by a $ 1.9 million gain on the repurchase of debt. Although the earnings were off 68 percent from $ 10 million a year earlier, they were a reversal of losses in the second and third quarters. Revenue rose 13 percent to $ 184 million from $ 163 million. For the full year, Apollo said its earnings fell 90 percent to $ 2.1 million, or 6 cents a share, from $ 20 million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 18 percent to a record $ 654 million from $ 554 million.

<HEAD>Japanese Auto Production Reached Record 12.7 Million Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Japanese automakers built a record 12.7 million cars, trucks and buses in 1988, up 3.7 percent from the previous year, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday. The previous record, 12.3 million vehicles, was set in 1985. Annual output declined since then due to the yen's sharp rise against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, making Japanese cars more expensive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A soft American market also contributed to the decline. Export figures for 1988, due for release next week, will show a total of about 6 million vehicles, meaning a decline of 3.2 percent from 1987, said the report. The association attributed the record-high 1988 production to brisk domestic sales, which shot up 11 percent to a record 6.7 million vehicles. The strong domestic demand was a result of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s steady economic growth and vigorous personal spending, it said <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> last year again produced the largest number of vehicles among 11 Japanese makers, nearly 4 million, up 9.1 percent from 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was second, at nearly 2.2 million, down 2.8 percent. Total passenger car production last year increased 3.9 percent to a record 8.2 million, while 4.4 million trucks, up 3.2 percent, and 57,000 buses, up 14.9 percent, were built, it said.

 The stock market was mixed today, pausing after Tuesday's runup to its highest level since the crash of 1987. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 38.04 points on Tuesday, slipped back 1.61 to 2,254.82 in the first half hour today. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 549 up, 404 down and 523 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 29.70 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Analysts said the market lately has appeared to be emerging from the long shadow cast by the crash. The Dow Jones industrial average's rise Tuesday to its highest level since before Black Monday Oct. 19, 1987 was widely seen as a big step in that direction. The market also has been helped by a rising dollar in foreign exchange and falling interest rates in the long-term bond market. With all that, however, brokers said there remained many skeptics, expecting a slowing economy, who were unwilling to chase after stocks at their current levels.

 Share prices were higher in active trading at midday Wednesday, although off the best levels, amid what dealers called a renewed confidence in financial markets. Shares bounded 26 points higher at the opening, on a combination of bullish sentiment from Wall Street's 38-point surge Tuesday, a perception that British interest rates might fall before the March 14 budget and a perception that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might be more successful than originally thought in tackling the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit. In addition, dealers said a large program trade was activated early in the session, which contained a hefty chunk of buy orders. Shares trimmed their advance by midday in what one dealer called `` orderly profit-taking.'' By about noon the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was up 14.1 points, or 0.7 percent, at 1,955.2, also the session's low point The index hit its peak of 1,967.1 at the start of official dealings.

 Aging, and expanding, baby boomers are turning more often to low-calorie drinks and <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is bidding for their taste buds by pitting its chief diet soda against rival <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION>'s flagship sugared brand. The marketing move is the first time a major cola company has aimed a diet drink directly at a leading non-diet competitor, and has sparked an escalation of the war for dominance of the giant soft drink market. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> today announced that it had signed a worldwide sponsorship and advertising deal with pop star <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> that will include a major global ad campaign beginning next month and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> sponsorship of the singer's upcoming world tour. `` The diet segment is a big, growing segment, and as people get older they tend more towards diet,'' said <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a beverage industry analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, publisher of industry newsletter <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION>, said the diet cola market grew 8.4 percent and sugared cola volume rose 3.2 percent last year. He said diet drinks account for 25.2 percent of the $ 26 billion wholesale market. `` I believe that in the early 2010s, the diet market will be the tail wagging the soft-drink dog,'' <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> estimated it will take a generation before diet colas outsell sugar colas. <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> recognized the trend last year, producing commercials featuring prize fighters and football players that moved away from past diet drink strategies targeting women. <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>'s battle plan for <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> was the first major marketing excursion since <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> was named president of the company's domestic operations last year `` Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> moving ahead of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> is the next logical step in the long-term trend,'' <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> said in a statement announcing the campaign. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> _ whose Coca-Cola Classic is the nation's top-selling brand _ announced its latest goal in the aftermath of a highly visible advertising blitz during Sunday's Super Bowl telecast. The package included a ballyhooed three-dimensional spot for Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> and another new commercial featuring celebrities that included actor and former <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> pitchman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a star of the television show `` Miami Vice.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> contends <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>'s claims ignore consumer propensity to buy by price and not brand, and the No. 2 cola-maker had been expected to mount its own counteroffensive. In addition to the <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> signing, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> won sponsorship of the <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> player talent show that aired before the Super Bowl. The company in recent years has boosted its brands through celebrity ads featuring <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Richie </PERSON>. Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> gave no timetable for its goal of boosting Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> past <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're not saying this is going to happen overnight or within the next year or two. Granted, it's going to take some time,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> also claims that almost 2 million families stopped buying regular <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> last year, and <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said more than a quarter of them turned to Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON> countered that half of all soft drink consumers identify themselves as `` brand-switchers,'' meaning just as many people switched from <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> as from <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> backed up <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>, saying, `` People do n't just drink one soft drink; people do mess around.'' Besides the new television commercials, <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> said its campaign will include 200 million national magazine and newspaper coupons and local sweepstakes offering airline tickets and other prizes. Whether <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>'s plan succeeds is almost irrelevant, <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> said. `` I believe that <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> believes that statistical reality is not as important as the perception of pitting the number three brand against the number two brand, because it finesses the number one position for Coke Classic,'' he said. According to <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, Coca-Cola Classic topped all brands last year with 20.1 percent of domestic sales. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> was second with 18.7 percent, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> at 8.2 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> at 5.2 percent. Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> was the fastest growing brand, gaining 0.5 percent of a share compared with a year ago. Caffeine-free Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> added 0.3 percent to reach 2 percent overall, good for ninth place. Together, <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> and caffeine-free Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> accounted for 10.2 percent of the market, <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> and caffeine-free <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> had 19.5 percent, while Diet <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> and caffeine-free Diet <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> were at 6.6 percent, he said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee for transportation secretary told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` can and will take a leading role in combating terrorism in the skies.'' <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, testifying at his confirmation hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said stopping terrorism `` means meeting head-on the gruesome threat ... with all the resources we can muster.'' In written responses to questions posed by the panel, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said that foreign airlines serving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be forced to meet the same security requirements as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. He said that if the government issues new security requirements for American carriers, `` a means must be employed to assure that foreign air carriers that offer service to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be required to make the same improvements.'' The 50-year-old Illinois transportation administrator was also likely to face questions about air safety, the aging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft fleet and its recent rash of mechanical problems. Other likely topics were proposals to remove the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to improve its efficiency, drug testing for transportation workers, and truck and bus safety. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was also expected to be asked to contrast <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s views on federal transportation spending with those of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who often sought to phase out <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance in such areas as mass transit and <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, the passenger railroad. As the hearing began, Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, withdrew objections to <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s appointment that he had expressed over <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s conduct when, as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, he declined to prosecute <PERSON> G.D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> Co. There had been allegations that it fraudulently tested <ORGANIZATION> NutraSweet </ORGANIZATION>, the artificial sweetener. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> later joined the law firm that represented <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> in the case. Last month, <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> called for a delay in <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s confirmation vote until questions about the situation were answered <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he `` conducted himself in accordance with <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> guidelines'' in the case. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told the senators that before leaving the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office he had ended his involvement in the <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> case and that the decision to not prosecute the firm was made by others <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said that based on <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s explanation he believes the appointee to be `` a man of integrity,'' and said he now expected to vote to confirm <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>. In his written responses, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said that making the security requirements uniform would prevent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines from losing business because of cumbersome security procedures which might inconvenience passengers. Last year, before the Dec. 21 explosion that destroyed Pan American Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> proposed rules that would require foreign airlines serving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to have security procedures approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. The rule has not yet taken effect, however. Domestic carriers are already required to have FAA-approved security programs. Eight days after the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> disaster, which killed all 259 people on board and 11 others on the ground, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> toughened the security steps it requires <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to follow at airports in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Despite <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s objections, the sentiment on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> was that <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> would have little trouble gaining <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval for his new job. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign chairman in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> in 1980 and 1988, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> carried the state. He has been chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, the country's second largest transportation system, since 1984. He is also an instrument-rated pilot and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which lobbies <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of private plane owners and pilots.

 Futures prices of grains and soybeans were lower today in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat futures were weighed down by the rainy weather forecast for the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> growing areas and a slackening of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat exports, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, a grains analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Report: SEC Dropped 1983 Probe Into Drexel, Milken</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government investigator in 1983 concluded that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and others were involved in securities fraud, but the case was dropped about four years before similar charges were brought against the investment firm, according to a report published Wednesday. A <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> lawyer spent two years investigating <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and told superiors he had evidence of a fraudulent scheme to disguise ownership of stocks and manipulate stock prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported. In a 33-page confidential memo, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s high-yield `` junk bond'' financier, had manipulated the price of shares of <ORGANIZATION> Reliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an insurance holding company run by takeover strategist <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, the newspaper said. The Journal did not disclose where the October 1983 memo was obtained. But the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s chief enforcement officer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said the newspaper received the material from an unidentified congressional committee. The newspaper also reported that between 1980 and 1985 four <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> investigations implicated <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> but all were closed without action. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> investigation was said to focus on trading in the stock of <ORGANIZATION> Reliance </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Leasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, another <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> company, before and after a July 1981 announcement that the companies would be merged and taken private in 1982. The Journal said <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> wrote that `` securities were warehoused and manipulated in a complex scheme to facilitate'' the transaction. Warehousing involves placing stocks in accounts that disguise ownership. But the probe was dropped in March 1984 because of lack of evidence, the Journal said. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> last September filed civil charges against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> accusing them of scheming with now-imprisoned inside trader <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> to commit securities fraud. On Tuesday, the government made public the six specific fraud counts that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to plead guilty to as part of a record $ 650 million settlement that concluded a two-year inquiry by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. The government accused <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> with participating in a litany of criminal acts ranging from insider trading to stock manipulation involving some of the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> takeover targets of the 1980s. In the 1983 <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> memo, the Journal account said, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> investigator said that from 1979 through at least 1983 <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> ran `` a trading scheme ... to warehouse and manipulate securities for the benefit of certain -LRB- high-yield department -RRB- clients.'' <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> also said two investment partnerships including <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, also appeared to have violated federal disclosure laws, the Journal account said. A spokesman for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> denied any wrongdoing in the 1983 allegations. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that `` these were thorough investigations, and to assume otherwise is n't well-founded.'' `` But the point is that having already reached an agreement with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, we now are in good-faith negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to establish enhanced procedures that will prevent even the appearance of these kinds of issues in the future,'' it said. The Journal said the investigation of <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> began when <ORGANIZATION> Reliance </ORGANIZATION> was cited as one of eight stocks the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> examined after spotting unusual price increases on New Year's Eve 1981. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> told the newspaper: `` I think you ought to put high up in your story that you were provided with non-public documents by a committee of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Because that's how <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> works. ... I think it stinks.'' He did not identify the committee. But Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted by the newspaper as saying of the 1983 probe: `` The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> did n't use the tools <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave it to protect investors, in this instance.

 A federal inspection of safety at a nuclear weapons plant near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> found serious lapses caused in part by inadequate worker training, but significant improvements are under way, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The outlines of a report on the inspection, conducted by a team of 20 safety experts last November and December, were presented Tuesday to members of a committee advising the government on how to correct technical and managerial problems at its nuclear weapons complex, which has been crippled in recent months. The full report was not disclosed. A key finding by the inspectors was insufficient training of workers at the Rocky Flats plutonium processing facility. This was in part due to a practice by the plant operator, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of letting workers switch to job assignments outside their area of expertise, officials said. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, a department safety official, cited an instance of workers in a low-level waste evaporator building reading the newspaper instead of monitoring safety indicators. `` This struck home the need for a greater -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- presence in the facility,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of energy for safety, health and quality assurance. He and other department officials stressed, however, that <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> managers had shown a much greater willingness to improve safety procedures at the plant, which reprocesses plutonium from old nuclear weapons for use in new ones. He said this change in <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>'s attitude had emerged over the past year. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> has made a `` noteworthy first step'' toward meeting <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> concerns, he said, by developing a comprehensive long-term strategy for safety improvements. The plant, situated about 16 miles from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, was shut down by federal authorities last October after an incident in which three employees were accidentally exposed to plutonium particles. <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> also reaffirmed to the advisory panel that a phased and closely monitored restarting of the Rocky Flats plant had begun last week. He said the plant could be in full operation as early as late March. At the same briefing to the advisory panel, <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> said more study will be needed to determine the severity of numerous cracks in the cooling systems of a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> reactor complex that produces key ingredients for nuclear weapons. The <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, is the nation's only source of tritium, a perishable and increasingly scarce gas vital to making nuclear warheads. The three-reactor complex has not been producing tritium since last April, when the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> shut down the last active reactor for safety reasons. <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> said an accident Sunday during testing at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> indicates `` a lack of control over what's going on in the reactors.'' Federal officials said there was no leakage of radiation or other hazardous material from the incident. The operator, E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, estimated damage at $ 20,000. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> disclosed earlier this month that it had discovered and was monitoring 27 cooling system cracks, including 15 in the K reactor, which it hopes to restart by the end of this year. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s advisory committee on nuclear facility safety, said <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> told his panel the cracking problem was `` probably not as serious as has been suggested, but it's still an open question.'' If the cracked pipes need to be replaced, the work could cause further delays in restarting the reactors.

 A bipartisan group of 12 senators unveiled legislation today that would reject a proposed 50 percent congressional pay raise, and roll back the increase if the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lets it become law. The rollback proposal is designed to give <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> pay-raise opponents a better weapon than a simple resolution to turn down the increase. It could keep the issue alive even if the raise goes into effect. Senators are expected to overwhelmingly reject the pay raise, while at the same time knowing that a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote appears unlikely. Unless both chambers reject the pay plan recommended by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the raise would become law automatically on Feb. 8. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, following the advice of a commission, recommended that congressional salaries rise from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000 for rank-and-file lawmakers. The recommendation would allow the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker to receive $ 175,000 instead of $ 115,000; and would pay $ 155,000 to the president pro tempore of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the majority and minority leaders of each house _ all of whom now earn $ 99,500. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also recommended 50 percent increases for top political appointees in the executive branch and for judges. Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, a main sponsor of the new legislation, said the rollback was the key provision. If the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approves the legislation and sends it to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> opponents of the raise could keep trying to tack it on to other bills after Feb. 8. The legislation also would require a vote on all future pay raises. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsors accused the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership of trying to duck a vote. Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, has been non-committal, while <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, has promised a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote. `` It's ridiculous not to have a vote on the pay raise,'' Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, told reporters. `` Not only is the amount outlandish, but it sets a pretty bad example. The public hates the pay increase and the way it's approved.'' Any rollback also would affect 50 percent raises for top executive branch officials, which also were part of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s recommendation Raises for judges were in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s package also, but can not constitutionally be cut back once they take effect. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsors of the legislation are Sens. <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>; <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>; <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, D-Nev.; <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill.; <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, 35 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members wrote <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to demand a vote `` out of respect The letter, written by Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, was signed by 30 Republicans and five Democrats. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had no comment. `` The prospect of an increase in congressional salaries has prompted a broad range of comments, but there is one theme that is constant,'' the letter said. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are firm in their conviction that regardless of the legislative form, there must be a vote on this enormous pay raise.''

 The stock market pushed ahead today, extending Tuesday's runup to the highest levels since the crash of 1987. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 38.04 points on Tuesday, gained another 3.93 to 2,260.36 by noontime today on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 708 up, 572 down and 530 unchanged. Analysts said the market lately has appeared to be emerging from the long shadow cast by the crash. The Dow Jones industrial average's rise Tuesday to its highest level since before Black Monday Oct. 19, 1987 was widely seen as a big step in that direction. The market also has been helped by a rising dollar in foreign exchange and falling interest rates in the long-term bond market. With all that, however, brokers said there remained many skeptics, expecting a slowing economy, who were unwilling to chase after stocks at their current levels. <ORGANIZATION> Raychem </ORGANIZATION> climbed 1 to 33 and <ORGANIZATION> Smithkline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 -LCB- to 52 -LRB- in active trading.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today his administration is considering imposing a fee on customers of savings and loan institutions to help the federal government pay to insure the troubled S & amp; L industry. A <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said accounts in commercial banks and credit unions also would be subject to the fees. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, appearing on television interview programs, said plans under review include such fees as 25 cents for every $ 100 in deposits at a thrift and that the premiums would be used by the federal government to insure the deposits. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` That's one option,'' adding that the idea had not been presented as a formal recommendation. `` And so I'm not going to say what I'm going to do, but that is one option,'' he said. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters, `` What you're looking at today is a trial balloon'' that was leaked to see what the reaction would be. `` There will be other trial balloons.'' `` We think it has merit,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Let's see how people react.'' He said the idea was first proposed as part of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget but did n't draw much attention. White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> spoke warmly about the proposal but insisted that it was `` one of many alternatives still being studied.'' He insisted it would be a `` premium'' and not a tax that would violated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s no-new-taxes pledge. `` That's just like any other insurance premium _ revenue generation for services rendered,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' `` The important thing here is that the federal insurance on deposits is going to be continued.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said administration officials have taken the plan to the chairmen of the congressional banking committees, Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., and Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION> `` They know how big this program is,'' he said. `` They're giving us plenty of of time to look at the options. They've been receptive.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddon </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has not clearly defined the option. He said the fee mentioned by <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> could be imposed on depositors, or it could be paid by the institutions as an increase in the insurance premium they already pay. The fee, or premium, would apply to all federally insured financial institutions: banks, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls and credit unions, he said. Previously, <PERSON> Siddon </PERSON> said the fee might apply only to S & amp; Ls. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures deposits in commercial banks, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that the proposal was `` the reverse toaster theory. Instead of the bank giving you a toaster when you make a deposit, you give them one.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> emphasized the plan has not been adopted by the administration _ he said it has n't even been presented to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ and rejected suggestions that it would represent a tax increase for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L customers. `` What we're doing is to examine all manner of options to pay for this savings and loan problem we have. It's a big problem. So we're discussing all kinds of things _ insurance based premiums, various different kind of options like that,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' program The Post, quoting unnamed sources, said the fee could raise $ 9 billion a year, which would cover interest payments on the $ 20 billion to $ 30 billion the government will have to raise for several years to close S & amp; Ls and pay off depositors. Another proposal, under which taxpayers would foot the bill for closing insolvent institutions, is being offered by the savings and loan industry's largest trade group. The proposal, released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, would also cut the fee that thrifts pay for deposit insurance. The proposal would give the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> responsibility for paying to resolve the cases of more than 350 insolvent, but still open, S & amp; Ls. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a meeting Tuesday with congressional leaders, said he would propose substantial revisions next month to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget, including measures to deal with the savings and loan crisis The League proposal called for tougher regulation, but said S & amp; Ls should be preserved as an industry separate from commercial banking. The recommendation, which the group plans to present at a congressional hearing Thursday, drew immediate criticism from members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's called, ` How to transfer the problems of the S & amp; L industry to the taxpayers,''' said Rep. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> said the healthy portion of the S & amp; L industry should n't be bled dry, but he said the lobby group `` is just trying to put a sugar coating on a pretty bitter pill.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> proposal represents a realistic recognition that tougher regulation is in order, but an unrealistic expectation that the taxpayers should be stuck with the bill.'' `` The more money the taxpayers are asked to eat, the tougher the reform package should be,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> plan calls for the creation of a <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, a new, independent federal agency that would be responsible for liquidating or selling currently insolvent S & amp; Ls as well as any institutions that lapse into insolvency in the next three years. It also would take over all of the obligations the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has acquired in rescuing institutions in the past. The Resolution Corporation would raise money by issuing notes, which would be guaranteed by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. Any money the corporation gets from selling failed S & amp; Ls to new investors or from selling the assets would go toward paying off the notes. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> would have to pay most of the bill. In the meantime, a new, industry-funded <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> would be created to insure the deposits of healthy S & amp; Ls, which would pay an insurance premium no higher than the premiums paid by commercial banks to their fund, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is looking at the possibility of making managers of companies involved in leveraged buyouts or takeover attempts disclose more information about their own fate in the transactions, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that managers involved in some recent takeovers have avoided <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> regulations requiring them to disclose their own interest in the surviving company in third-party takeovers because they are not a direct participant. `` They may have an implied promise by the takeover or financial people that technically falls outside the transaction,'' <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said. `` Technically our rules now do n't require them to disclose that.'' He said those assurances to managers usually take the form of `` We will not promise you equity participation -LRB- in the new company -RRB- but in our 45 previous transactions we always have.'' <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said the commission is now looking at revising its regulations on management disclosures to require them in all negotiated transactions. But he said that no new legislation is needed to do it. `` We have sufficiently broad rulemaking powers,'' he said. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> was the second witness in two days of hearings by the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> into the mushrooming of junk-bond-financed leveraged buyout attempts, some of them launched by managers of exisiting companies, in the past year. After <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s managers tried to buy up all the publicly owned stock last November in a leveraged buyout only to be outbid with a 30 percent higher $ 25 billion offer from <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, there have been concerns about whether managements in such takeovers are acting in the best interests of stock and bond holders. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said that as long as there is an auction process, shareholders ususally end up maximizing their gain. But he expressed concern they may not be getting the maximum value in deals where a company's publicly held stock is purchased in buybacks without an effective bidding process. Testifying Tuesday before the same committee, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> estimated the cost of leveraged buyouts, or LBOs, and takeover defenses at $ 60 billion in 1988 alone. While many restructured companies find themselves in trouble because they can not make the interest payments on their new debt, the investment banks, arbitrageurs, underwriters and LBO managers involved in the deals collect hundreds of millions of dollars in up-front fees, he complained. `` Sadly, these same parties may have relatively little, if any, investment in the long-term success of the new enterprise,'' he said. `` Given this arrangement, it may very well be that the net effect of LBOs is a financial snipe hunt, where the new long-term investors, flashlight in hand, are left holding the bag.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s testimony on the wave of leveraged buyouts was the strongest indication yet that the new administration wants the trend reversed. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary said he would prefer that `` the gladiators in the arena'' _ the investment bankers, corporate and insurance executives and pension fund managers who trade in high-interest, high-risk junk bonds _ address the problem on their own. But he coupled that with a warning. `` It is the finest tradition of our democratic system that government look first to the people themselves for solutions and only act _ but do act _ when it is clear the people can not solve the problem themselves,'' he said. However, how far the government should go in restraining buyouts is wide open to debate. The most widely discussed option is not allowing companies to deduct as an expense the high rates of interest they pay on junk bonds _ a move that both <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> attempted to discourage Tuesday while acknowledging it may happen anyway. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that attempting to tax the interest on junk bonds would probably be ineffective because corporate lawyers would find some other way of tax-free debt financing. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> agreed. `` The long history of attempts to define problems out of existence has proved that the definees are more adept then the definers,'' he said. `` Just as soon as the new regulations are written, efforts are under way to render them irrelevant.'' Like <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said he would prefer that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reduce the tax on dividends to encourage more equity financing of corporations. But both men acknowledged that is unlikely because of the budget deficit. When the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1985 proposed giving companies a tax credit for the dividends they pay, the annual cost to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> in lost tax dollars was put at $ 7 billion.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officials said today they have begun scheduling appointments with possible buyers and denied that their claims of more than 50 suitors are meant to stall a <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> takeover attempt by boosting stock prices. `` The process is well under way,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wichlep </PERSON>. `` We have set up data rooms here in our building and have already started making appointments with representatives of other companies to come in and review our data and to hear presentations by officers of the company.'' Trading in <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> stock was suspended briefly Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after a company lawyer told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> that the natural-gas company might use a `` white knight'' to block Coastal's $ 2.6 billion takeover bid. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> <PERSON> Werlein </PERSON> told <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> that the company has a list of more than 50 possible buyers. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION>, another Houston-based natural-gas company, later suggested that the comment was designed to inflate <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> stock prices to make <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION>'s offer appear inadequate. Texas Eastern officials said the number is legitimate and was provided only to inform <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> of their actions, but they acknowledged they are trying to maximize their stock price. `` This is a bona fide effort in our ongoing process to determine the maximum value of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> stock,'' <PERSON> Wichlep </PERSON> said this morning. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $ 48.25 Tuesday, down from its record $ 48.50 close Monday. Trading was suspended at 11:20 a.m. because of an imbalance of shares on the buy side, but resumed at 12:09 p.m. Coastal has offered $ 42 per share for all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> shares.

The meeting between executives of the two companies was the only face-to-face contact since Coastal announced its takeover bid Jan. 16.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today that while he's determined to be an environmentalist, he favors `` prudent development'' by oil companies in the Arctic wildlife refuge Commenting on an issue environmentalists say will be a litmus test of his intentions, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he believes `` we can find the balance between environmental interests and national security interests'' to permit some development of oil and gas resources in the refuge. Environmentalists have been trying to enlist <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support to keep oil companies out of the vast refuge. For years there has been a fierce debate in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and between environmentalists and the oil companies over whether a 1.5-million-acre coastal strip of the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> should be opened for oil drilling. In the final days of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> formally urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to clear the way for oil and gas development in the refuge and proposed a land swap deal as the best way to do it. A dozen of the leading environmental and conservation groups, including some of the movement's biggest names, urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a letter Tuesday to review <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>'s position with an eye toward reversing the department's recommendation to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have strenuously opposed this proposal as a shortsighted sacrifice of a national treasure for a few months of energy that is readily procurable elsewhere,'' the groups said. But in an Oval Office interview with a small group of reporters today, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that brought to mind similar arguments made about the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil pipeline. `` I remember the pipeline. I remember the arguments against it,'' he said. `` And I also know the effect it did not have on the caribou.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said his administration intends to be a strong defender of the environment, but also has indicated in the past that he favors expanded oil drilling in the Arctic. `` I'm in favor of prudent development there,'' he said today. `` ... I think I'm determined to be an environmentalist. I am one, and I'm concerned that we not do irreparable damage to the environment.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said that `` we have some national security interests at stake here'' in terms of making the country less reliant on imported energy supplies. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must approve opening up any of the 19-million-acre wildlife refuge in northeastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> for drilling, and it did n't take long for the issue to surface this year On the first day of the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, legislation was introduced with 38 co-sponsors in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to declare the 1.5-million-acre coastal strip of the Arctic wildlife refuge a protected wilderness. On the same day, other legislation also was introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to open the same land for oil and gas development. The oil industry `` would like to move this fast'' and `` create a sense of national emergency'' before environmental groups can mobilize, suggested <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Frampton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s action last week at the end of his tenure as <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary infuriated the environmental movement, which has vowed to fight any attack on the refuge _ home for the Porcupine caribou, polar bears and millions of birds. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, called on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene in `` the rush to trample the Arctic'' and said the president's actions on Arctic development will be `` the test of this administration'' on whether it is serious about protecting the environment. Earlier in the week, many of the environmental leaders met with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, to voice their concern about the wildlife refuge. <PERSON> Frampton </PERSON> questioned the need to open the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> region now for drilling when there is no need for the additional petroleum. In future years, he suggested, technology might be developed to protect the environment better. `` We can postpone the decision and have it both ways _ wilderness and oil,'' he said. Other groups that signed the letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Izaak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, Defenders of Wildlife and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>.

 There is an hour wait on weekends for a table at the 140-seat restaurant of the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as patrons jam the bar to guzzle European-style beer brewed on the premises. `` We're brewing around the clock and selling it as fast as we make it,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>, 27, who owns the bar with his brother <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>. The brothers restored <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>'s first tavern last September and started brewing beer, part of a growing nationwide brewing trend as local brewers apply their craft in `` brewpubs'' and `` microbreweries,'' offering a variety of beers to local clientele. Great Lakes patrons can choose from three different brews at $ 2.20 a glass with names such as <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON>'s Amber, named for <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Ness </PERSON>, who frequented the bar and ran for mayor of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> before gaining fame as a lawman, said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> <PERSON> Thaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who worked for <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>'s former <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schmidt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was persuaded to come out of retirement and apply his skills on a smaller scale. Great Lakes can brew 750 to 1,000 31-gallon barrels of beer a year, a typical amount for brewpubs which offer beer for on-premise consumption. Microbreweries brew and bottle beer for regional consumption, though the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which operates a 250-seat restaurant in a revamped furniture store, hopes to offer their ale both ways. `` We are hoping to offer people small plastic, resealable kegs so people can take it home,'' said bar manager <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucitt </PERSON>, adding the brewpub has attracted a number of celebrities since it opened a year ago. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> stops in every now and then. <PERSON> Wilt </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> was in the other night and Magic -LRB- <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> -RRB- stops by,'' <PERSON> Lucitt </PERSON> said. At the start of 1986, there were only 29 microbreweries, breweries which produce less than 15,000 barrels a year, and brewpubs in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewers </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo </LOCATION><LOCATION> . </LOCATION> Since then, the number has doubled each year. At the start of 1989, there were 120 brewpubs and microbreweries operating in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Papazian </PERSON>, who founded the association in 1978 and edits the association's magazine titled Zymurgy, the branch of chemistry dealing with fermentation. At the <ORGANIZATION> Rooster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> and Grill in <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, patrons can try a brown ale named Old Brown Dog or, in the summer, a light, wheat beer, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Egelston </PERSON>, a co-owner of the brewpub. `` The novelty of the beer is enough to bring people in the first time, but not enough to bring them back,'' <PERSON> Egelston </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> Chester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Drum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> will help usher in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s new brew Feb. 1 when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, rolls out the first barrel of <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> Lager. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, 26, developed his interest in beer at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> where he reviewed the history of brewing for a seminar. After graduation, he worked in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in invesment banking but continued to study the market for beer and, after raising $ 500,000, founded the brewing company, basing his beer on a recipe that dates to colonial <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` It's a renaissance back to pre-prohibition days when <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> had over 100 breweries,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` There were 4,000 breweries in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1870 but by 1980, there were only 40 in the country.'' But the brewing giants of the country need not fear competition from the new upstarts. The <ORGANIZATION> Boulder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> brewers </ORGANIZATION>' association reports microbreweries and brewpubs brewed a total of 100,000 barrels of beer in 1987, or about one-half percent of all beer brewed and sold in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. That figure increased to 120,000 in 1988 and <PERSON> Papazian </PERSON> said the microbreweries and brewpubs may hit the 180,000-barrel mark in 1989. The large breweries continue to dominate the domestic beer industry which in 1988 brewed and sold 188 million barrels of beer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, about the same amount as the year before, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinman </PERSON>, publisher of Beer Marketer's Insights, which tracks trends in the brewing industry from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nyack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` You are obviously not talking about a major impact on the industry,'' said <PERSON> Steinman </PERSON>. `` In the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, some microbreweries may have an impact on some imports and superpremiums but they are not hurting the beer industry.'' Beer from microbreweries and brewpubs, generally more expensive than domestic beer, attracts the same consumers as import beers and could have an impact on overall sales of foreign-brewed beer which accounts for about 5 percent of beer sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steinman </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he believes the economy is `` reasonably stable'' and hopes the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> wo n't overreact to inflationary fears by driving interest rates up further. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an Oval Office interview with two newspaper reporters that he had not yet read comments that <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> made Tuesday to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> voiced concern about inflation and said the board would keep a tight grip on the money supply. Asked about this today, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I must say that I'm encouraged that the markets, at least recently, have been saying that things are reasonably stable ... There's no signals out there in the markets that this economy is in real trouble.'' The president said, `` I have n't talked to <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> lately, but I do n't want to see us move so strongly against the fear of inflation that we impede growth. We have to keep expanding opportunities for the working men and women of this country.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, however, that he preferred not `` to get into commenting on'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s testimony. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> he was worried that strains on factory capacity and a tight labor market, particularly in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, are likely to keep inflation pressures bubbling in the near term. As a result, the central bank's monetary policy should continue on the tight side, he said. `` The long-run costs of a return to higher inflation, and the risks of this occurring under current circumstances, are sufficiently great that <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> policy at this juncture might well be advised to err more on the side of restrictiveness than of stimulus,'' he said. But, in response to questions, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> also indicated that the central bank would like to lower interest rates if it can be done at some point without causing an acceleration in price increases. `` Obviously we would prefer interest rates to be lower rather than higher all the time,'' he said. The stock market surged higher Tuesday, pushing the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average for the first time back to the levels it held just before the October 1987 market crash. Market watchers said investor optimism about <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s comments helped fuel the rally. `` The market reaction read it, No. 1, in the short term the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will continue to tighten to ensure that inflation is under control, but more importantly, in the longer run <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> leaned more in the direction of lower interest rates,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s accompanying contention that economic growth must dip below 3 percent could spell serious trouble for the administration of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is counting on high growth and lower interest rates to bring the budget deficit down. The growth generates more tax revenue for the government, while lower interest rates reduce the carrying costs on the $ 2.7 trillion national debt.

<HEAD>Philip Morris Reports 28.5 Percent Drop In 4th-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its earnings rose 26.9 percent in 1988 but fell 28.5 percent in the fourth quarter because of a $ 348 million pre-tax charge to cover a restructuring at General Foods <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, the New York-based cigarette, food and brewing giant that completed the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> last month, said it earned $ 342 million, or $ 1.48 a share, in the quarter, down from $ 478 million, or $ 2.02 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 19.9 percent to $ 8.64 billion from $ 7.2 billion. For the full year, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings rose to $ 2.34 billion, or $ 10.03 a share, from $ 1.84 billion, or $ 7.75 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 12.6 percent to $ 31.7 billion from $ 28.2 billion. The charge at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; International covered the closing of a Jell-O plant in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, and other streamlining moves, including layoffs. Excluding that charge, fourth-quarter earnings would have risen 15.9 percent. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said its acquisition of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> on Dec. 7, 1988, reduced its earnings by about $ 28 million, including financing costs and amortization of goodwill. But adoption of a new method of accounting for income taxes boosted net earnings for 1988 by $ 213 million. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> contributed $ 821 million in operating revenue to <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> since its early-December acquisition. However, the <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> purchase also boosted <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>'s debt by $ 10.6 billion, including $ 1 billion that was on <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s books. `` As was the case when we acquired <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> three years ago, we are assuming large additional debt,'' <PERSON> Hamish </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, the chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. `` We are confident of our ability to service this acquisition-related debt and to pay it down over the next few years, as well as to sustain a good growth in earnings, volume and market shares in 1989 and beyond,'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said. Among individual market segments, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> said revenue rose 11.3 percent to $ 8.5 billion at <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>; rose 15.4 percent to $ 8.1 billion at <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>; rose 9.8 percent to $ 3.8 billion at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>; rose `` slightly'' to $ 4.4 billion at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; International; rose 5 percent to $ 2.3 billion at <ORGANIZATION> Oscar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>; and rose 5.1 percent to $ 3.3 billion at <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>American Express Reports Profit For Quarter, Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that it made a profit in the fourth quarter following a year-earlier loss while earnings for all of 1988 nearly doubled. The company attributed the improvement to record income in the divisions that run its credit card and financial services businesses and to a rebound in earnings from its bank following an easing of the Third World debt crisis. However, its brokerage firm, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, lost money in the final quarter and suffered a decline in annual income. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said net income totaled $ 231 million, or 54 cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a $ 104 million loss in the 1987 quarter. Revenue jumped 34 percent, to $ 6.3 billion from $ 4.8 billion. The 1987 quarter included a $ 350 million after-tax provision for loan losses at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and $ 46 million in tax benefits from new accounting rules. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> netted $ 1.04 billion, or $ 2.43 a share, compared with earnings of $ 533 million, or $ 1.20 a share, in 1987. Revenue totaled $ 22.9 billion, up 30 percent from $ 17.7 billion in the previous year. Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the latest quarterly and annual results `` demonstrated our leadership position in travel and financial services.'' `` Two of our four business units reported record income for the year,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> noted in a statement. `` Travel Related Services led the way with record earnings in 1988, capping a decade in which profits compounded at more than 17 percent a year.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Related </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> division, which runs the credit card and travelers checks business, quarterly earnings climbed 18 percent to $ 184 million from $ 155 million. For the year, it earned a record $ 773 million, up 18 percent from 1987 income of $ 655 million. Revenue in 1988 rose 22 percent to $ 7.4 billion. During the year, credit-card charge volume climbed 18 percent to a record $ 89 billion, partly reflecting additional services offered to cardmembers.

 <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s government-owned oil company, <ORGANIZATION> Statoil </ORGANIZATION>, Wednesday proposed an early retirement program and a continued hiring freeze in an effort to trim 2 billion kronor, or $ 300 million, from its annual operating costs. The company said it also may reduce and defer investments `` and is considering whether to sell or exchange offshore equities.'' The proposals were prepared for a meeting of the board of directors, a company statement said. `` Such cuts are in line with what we expected,'' said Oil and Energy Minister <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Oeien </PERSON>, welcoming the company's move. <ORGANIZATION> Statoil </ORGANIZATION>, which has been hit by the fall in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil prices, said its three-year goal was to reduce manpower by 1,500 man-years, or about 14 percent. It also would reduce the work given to outside consultants or temporary employees. Retirement will be offered to anyone who has turned 60 by this year. The layoff of personnel will depend on how successul the cost-cutting program is, the statement said.

<HEAD>U.S. Tells Europeans It Wants Talks on Telecommunications</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to begin negotiations to ensure the American telecommunications industry has broad access to European markets, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Wednesday. `` We want a free and open market,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingon </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the 12-nation trading bloc, also known as the Common Market. He told reporters the 1988 U.S. Trade Act targets the telecommunications area for discussions with leading trading partners. It requires that negotiations in that field begin within 30 days. `` We want market access for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' products and services,'' he said. `` We want non-discriminatory procurement policies -LRB- and -RRB- non-discriminatory standards-setting,'' he said. `` And we want some reasonable access to European telecommunications networks.'' `` What we want in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is what -LRB- Europeans -RRB- want in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Kingon </PERSON> said he discussed the request for opening the fresh talks with <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s top trade official, and <PERSON> Filippo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pandolfi </PERSON>, who holds the telecommunications portfolio. <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nico </PERSON> <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> had not received details about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaints. `` Pending this further information, the community is indeed seriously concerned about this matter,'' he said. The world market in telecommunications equipment amounted to $ 90 billion in 1986, according to <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> figures. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> had 19 percent of the market share and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> 38 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is to form a unified, single market by the end of 1992, when the dozen member states plan to remove the trade barriers separating them. Some in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> worry that the community will use its newfound closeness to try to keep out <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other foreign competition. Telecommunications policies, tariffs and certification vary among the member states. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the community's executive body, issued a plan last June for fashioning a common internal market for trade in telecommunications equipment and services by 1992 <PERSON> Kingon </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> approves of the principles in that plan. But, he said, `` We would have liked -LRB- it -RRB- to have gone perhaps a little further and state specifically, rather than by inherent implication, that third-country exporters would have access to that market.'' He said the telecommunications area was not covered effectively by regulations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 96-nation free trade body. International negotiations, under the auspices of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, are under way to press for further easing of trade barriers. Telecommunications is an area under discussion in those talks, called the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round. <PERSON> Kingon </PERSON> insisted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to call for talks with the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> was not intended to spark a trade dispute. `` It is not a new brawl. It is not retaliation,'' he said. The new trade legislation gives <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials a year to complete negotiations but the president can grant additional one-year extensions to complete discussions. `` There is nothing in the law that mandates the president to take any kind of retaliatory action,'' <PERSON> Kingon </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Weirton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it would go public to raise money for a $ 600 million modernization project under a plan allowing workers at the nation's largest employee-owned company to retain a majority stake. The country's seventh-largest steelmaker said it will apply for a listing on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> when it goes public later this year, pending approval of the plan by employees. The agreement between the company's management and the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> would reduce the 8,000 employees' profit sharing from 50 percent to 35 percent of the company's after-tax The company's pension plan would not change. The agreement also calls for a public stock offering of at least $ 50 million worth of the 6.5 million common shares now held by employees. In addition, it would create a new employee stock ownership plan, or <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>, of 600,000 convertible preferred shares that would ensure majority ownership by giving the new shares 10 votes each to one vote each for the common shares. The preferred stock would not be traded. Employees upon retirement could either sell it back to the company or convert it into common shares the company said it would recycle into the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>. Employees could sell up to 35 percent of their common stock publicly under the agreement, but they would have to retain the rest until they retire or leave the company. Retirees could sell all their stock. New employees would have to wait three years before they could own stock. The 13-member board of directors would not change _ three members each from management and the union and the other seven from outside the company. Any issuance of new stock would require 90 percent board approval. `` The company will have the economic basis to move forward with major modernization. We have the opportunity to realize a bright future,'' union president <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Weirton </ORGANIZATION> Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Elish </PERSON> said the company needs to invest $ 600 million over the next several years to modernize its plant and keep it competitive. On Wednesday, the company said its 1989-92 plan calls for a major renovation of its continuous slab caster to produce 100 percent cast steel; completion of its hot mill renovations; and renovations in its ironmaking blast furnaces and finishing mills. <ORGANIZATION> Weirton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> employees purchased the plant in 1984 after the owner, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intergroup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said it would invest no more money in the facility.

 <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its quarterly profit rose 48 percent, bouyed by sales of `` Cinderella'' in home video and by strong performances at its amusement parks. <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 148.3 million, or $ 1.08 a share, in its first quarter, ended Dec. 31, up from $ 100.4 million, or 73 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Sales in the quarter were $ 1.04 billion, up from $ 734.6 million a year earlier. The Burbank-based entertainment company said both the profit and sales figures were a record for its first quarter. First-quarter sales in Disney's theme parks and resorts division rose to $ 511.6 million from $ 385.7 million a year earlier. Disney wo n't disclose attendance figures at <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, but said results in the division were boosted by `` excellent attendance'' and higher per-guest spending at its amusement parks and resorts. First-quarter revenue in Disney's filmed entertainment segment rose 38 percent, to $ 409.9 million from $ 297.8 million a year earlier. The company attributed the rise to the popularity of such movies as `` Who Framed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>,'' and particularly to strong sales of `` Cinderella'' in home video. The consumer products segment, growing as the company opens more stores to sell <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> toys, clothes and memorabilia, had sales of $ 122 million, up from $ 51 million a year earlier.

 The dollar slipped against most major currencies Wednesday after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> again cut short a modest rally with a round of dollar-selling. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> apparently acted alone, traders said, in contrast to previous trading sessions in which the big European central banks also sold dollars. The single-handed intervention, executed near the end of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s trading day, was nevertheless successful in keeping the dollar in check `` It seemed to have a lot of effect for what was actually done. The market has gotten edgy lately.

Some traders who are bullish toward the dollar said they would wait for Friday's publication of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> preliminary gross national product figures for the fourth quarter before attempting to bid up the dollar. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.70 Japanese yen to a closing 127.65 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 127.75 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar fell to 127.43 yen from 127.70 yen late Tuesday.

Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound rose to $ 1.7708 from $ 1.7690 Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.8405 West German marks, down from 1.8415; 1.5630 Swiss francs, up from 1.5607; 1.1841 Canadian dollars, up from 1.822; 6.2553 French francs, down from 6.2617; and 1,345.5 Italian lire, down from 1,347.5 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday, included: 1.8435 West German marks, up from 1.8395; 1.5670 Swiss francs, up from 1.5523; 6.2715 French francs, up from 6.2335; 2.0820 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0680; 1,350.50 Italian lire, up from 1,340.50; and 1.1840 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1866.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it had signed pop star <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> for a global ad campaign that industry watchers said would chart virgin waters by debuting a song in a television commercial. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> _ firing the latest volley in the newly escalating marketing war with <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ also will sponsor a planned world tour by the actress-singer later in 1989 after the release of <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s first album in three years, `` Like A Prayer.'' The <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> announcement comes on the heels of industry leader <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>'s new ad campaign aimed at pushing sales of Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> past <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>, currently second in the market behind Coke Classic. That effort marks the first time a major diet soda has squared off directly against a leading sugared competitor, signaling a new intensity in the years-old cola wars. <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month signed pop singer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> for a series of Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> commercials, on top of a campaign already featuring hockey star <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gretzky </PERSON>, model <PERSON> Elle </PERSON> <PERSON> MacPherson </PERSON> and `` Miami Vice'' star <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a one-time <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> pitchman. `` What's obviously shaping up is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> versus <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> and sugar <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Tortorici </PERSON> said. `` Frankly, we like those odds.'' Terms of the <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> contract were not disclosed, but if history is any guide the deal with the brash singer of `` Like A Virgin'' and star of the movie `` Desperately Seeking Susan'' should be in the millions. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s award-winning ad campaigns featuring pop music began in 1984, when the number two soft-drink company signed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his brothers to a $ 5.5 million, one-year deal that was the largest of its kind at the time. Two years later, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> signed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for a reported $ 10 million to develop commercials over a three-year period. Rock stars <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Sound Machine also have appeared in <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> ads. `` <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> has really pioneered the entire music marketing phenomenon,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tod </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> said. `` People expect us to be on top of what's new, what's hot and what's next. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> is next.'' `` I think we set the trend and others have followed,'' he said. Modeled as mini music videos, the <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> ads have taken the common tactic of celebrity promotions a step further by using popular songs as the center of a direct sales pitch. The <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> deal adds another twist: using a commercial to debut a song aimed at a popular audience. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> said the title track to `` Like A Prayer'' would be heard publicly for the first time in a commercial to be aired in prime time early next month. The single is scheduled for release March 3 with the album to follow March 15, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlis </PERSON> said. `` I do n't recall anyone orchestrating the debut of a new record in a TV commercial,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, editor of Radio and Records, a music industry trade publication in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` It's a new stage in the marriage between commerce and the arts.'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said pop songs long have emerged from commercials _ including the Carpenters' `` We've Only Just Begun,'' originally a bank ad, and the recent British single `` The First Time'' by <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, which was spun off a <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> commercial. `` But gearing an actual planned commercial release for a TV spot I think is a new approach,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Somers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, dominate the $ 43.2 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soft-drink business. According to the industry newsletter Beverage Digest, <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Classic </ORGANIZATION> topped all brands last year with 20.1 percent of domestic sales. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> was second with 18.7 percent, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> at 8.2 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> at 5.2 percent.

 The stock market gained more ground Wednesday, extending Tuesday's runup to its highest levels since the crash of 1987. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had climbed 38.04 points on Tuesday, rose another 9.46 to 2,265.89. With four sessions to go in January, the average sports a gain of better than 97 points since the start of the year. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 820 up, 648 down and 520 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 183.61 million shares, against 189.62 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 217.85 million shares. Analysts said the market lately has seemed to be emerging from the long shadow cast by the crash. The Dow Jones industrial average's rise Tuesday to its highest level since before Black Monday Oct. 19, 1987 was widely seen as a big step in that direction. The market also has been helped by a rising dollar in foreign exchange and falling interest rates in the long-term bond market. With all that, however, brokers said there remained many skeptics, expecting a slowing economy, who were unwilling to chase after stocks at their current levels. If the day had a theme, it was upbeat earnings reports, sometimes accompanied by dividend increases. For example, <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> rose 2 -LRB- to 98 -LCB- on word from the company of higher 1988 earnings, a dividend increase, and plans for a buyback of as many as 20 million shares, or about 8 percent of the total outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> gained 2 -RCB- to 60 |, trading at new 52-week highs The company posted sharply higher earnings for the fourth quarter and raised its quarterly dividend from 40 to 60 cents a share. Upbeat earnings reports bolstered such other stocks as <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, up -LCB- at 72, and <ORGANIZATION> Smithkline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -RRB- at 52. On the downside, <PERSON> Amre </PERSON> suffered the day's biggest percentage loss, tumbling 3 -LCB- to 6 ~ The company said it may post a loss of about $ 2 million for its current fiscal quarter, which ends next week. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, which spoke of significantly lower results for the first quarter than the comparable period last year, fell 4 \ to 60 As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 6.07 billion, or 0.21 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained .34 to 162.33. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose .73 to 333.99, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up .65 at 289.14 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added 2.04 to 394.03. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index closed at 319.50, up .76.

 Spurred by export rumors, futures prices for wheat rose, but most corn and soybean prices dipped Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. In other markets, meat and livestock futures mostly were higher; precious metals rose and energy futures were sharply higher. Talk of impending developments from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> drove wheat prices higher, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with G.H. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. After the closing bell, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announced it has targeted the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for subsidized sales of 2 million more tons of wheat under the export bonus program. The agency also said it had increased from 16 million tons to 20 million tons the amount of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn and wheat the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> may purchase this year without new consultations. Soybean prices pulled back, falling 18 \ cents on the spot March contract, because European markets did n't follow through on Tuesday's rally in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and it appeared the recent spurt of commercial buying on meal sales was over, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, a grains analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> Wheat settled -RCB- cent to 2 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.39 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 \ cents lower, with March at $ 2.70 \ a bushel; oats were all 10 cents lower, with March at $ 2.25 \ a bushel; and soybeans were 3 cents to 18 \ cents lower with March at $ Futures prices for livestock and meat were mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s cold storage report, released Tuesday, provided some boost to prices, because although record inventories were set, the figures still were lower than expected. Live cattle settled unchanged to .30 cent higher, with the contract for delivery in February at 72.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .30 cent higher, with January at 83.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent lower to .53 cent higher, with February at 43.37 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .98 cent higher, with February at 39.70 cents a pound. Futures prices for precious metals mostly higher were on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold and silver usually move in the opposite direction of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, and dollar was slightly lower Wednesday, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonat </PERSON>, metals trader for <ORGANIZATION> Deak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold settled unchanged to 10 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in January at $ 406 a troy ounce, and silver was 3.2 cents to 4 cents higher, with January at $ 6.17 a troy ounce. Energy futures traded sharply higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Traders speculated that independent oil-producing nations might soon follow <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s lead in curbing production. A group of technicians from several independent producing nations is meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Thursday with counterparts from several members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> Exporting Countries. Crude oil settled 24 cents to 58 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in March at $ 18.12 a barrel, and heating oil was 1.24 cents to 1.36 cents higher, with February at 52.51 cents a gallon.

 <ORGANIZATION> Dana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a giant auto parts company, would buy 82-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 600 million in cash and stock under an agreement between the companies' managements announced Wednesday. Investors pushed Champion's stock above <PERSON> Dana </PERSON>'s offering price, indicating the belief that a higher offer might emerge from <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> or another bidder. The deal, which must be approved by Champion's shareholders, would end the independence of the spark plug maker that has been controlled by the <PERSON> Stranahan </PERSON> family since its founding in 1907. The two Toledo-based companies said the merger would unite Champion's famous name with <PERSON> Dana </PERSON>'s far-flung distribution system. Although not as well known as Champion, <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> is a bigger company, with 1987 sales of $ 4.9 billion. It makes a variety of automotive parts, including drive-train components, engine parts and chassis products. Champion had sales of $ 554 million through the first nine months of 1988. Champion's stock, already boosted by speculation of a merger, rose 25 centsre in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading to $ 18 a share, above <PERSON> Dana </PERSON>'s offering price of $ 17.50 a share in cash and stock. <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> fell $ 1.37 -LCB- a share in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> trading to $ 38.37 -LCB- a share. Under terms of the deal, <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> will make a $ 17.50-a-share cash tender offer by Feb. 1 for 17.3 million shares of Champion common stock, or about 50.1 percent of the stock on a fully diluted basis, Champion spokesman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mougey </PERSON> said. After the merger the rest of Champion's stock would be exchanged for cash or <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> stock with a value of $ 17.50 a share, with an overall limit that no more than half of Champion's shares will be bought for cash, the companies said. `` The combination of <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> and Champion will allow us to serve the automotive, industrial and aviation markets with a unique combination of well-recognized brand names and a distribution system which is second to none,'' said <PERSON> Southwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Morcott </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> Dana </PERSON>, a Toledo-based automotive parts company. <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, Champion's president and chief executive officer, said the sale will strengthen both companies. `` <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> brands are very well respected in the marketplace, and the <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> distribution system is state-of-the-art. We are looking forward to working together and capitalizing on the strengths we each bring to the combination,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Echlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Branford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> automotive parts company, had reportedly made a bid to buy Champion last week, a rumor denied by both companies. <ORGANIZATION> Echlin </ORGANIZATION> three years ago said it was interested in purchasing Champion. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Echlin </ORGANIZATION>'s director of investor relations, declined comment on whether the company would make an offer to buy Champion. `` Even if we were considering it I would n't be able to disclose that information,'' he said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Prebe </PERSON>, an auto industry analyst and former <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> vice president and corporate economist, said the $ 17.50-a-share offer is below what he believes the company's worth. `` We were looking for something in the neighborhood of $ 20, up to $ 22-a share offer. The price suggests that it was a very friendly composition between <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> and Champion,'' he said. <PERSON> Prebe </PERSON> said it is possible another company would make an counter offer to buy Champion. `` You still have the bulk of the shares still traded on Wall Street. If somebody wants to come in and get the remaining shares, it would be a dirty fight that would raise the stock,'' he said. `` Now is the nervous time for the guy sitting on the sidelines. He is thinking, ` Should I take the $ 17.50 or go along with something higher?' If nothing higher comes along and he has n't taken the $ 17.50, it may drop the stock down to $ 14, $ 15 dollars-a-share,'' he said. Market interest in Champion increased with reports that members of <ORGANIZATION> Chinook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>, holder of 35 percent of Champion's common stock, might dissolve the partnership. Chinook was founded three years ago when descendants of the company's founders, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stranahan </PERSON>, decided to pool their holdings to maintain a dominant voice in Champion's affairs. The <PERSON> Stranahan </PERSON> family members set an expiration date for the partnership of April 1, 1989, and analysts speculated that the younger generation of the family was pushing to divest some of their holdings. Champion's board of directors met in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> on Friday to discuss what it would do if the Stranahans dissolved their family partnership. The Chinook members met afterward. Neither group would comment on the meetings. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubicki </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union international representative, said he was surprised by the deal. `` It's difficult to really digest what has taken place and what the outcome and the future is going to be between the two parties,'' said <PERSON> Kubicki </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> unit chairman at <ORGANIZATION> Dana </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> plant, which has 340 workers. Champion earned $ 14.5 million, or 41 cents a share, on $ 554 million in sales during the first nine months of 1988, compared to $ 12.9 million, or 34 cents a share, on sales of $ 535 million in the same period of 1987. Champion, which makes spark plugs and other automotive products, employs about 10,000 people worldwide, including 2,250 workers at its five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian plants. <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> has 700 operations in 27 countries and employs about 35,000 workers.

 As a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee continued reviewing leveraged buyouts and whether they should be restricted, Wall Street deal makers reacted with anger and skepticism Wednesday about proposals to curtail the popular method for financing corporate acquisitions. `` They're trying to design a cure for something that has not been a problem,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, a managing director at <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> suggested to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that tax deductions for corporate interest payments be limited, while a new deduction for stock dividends be created At issue is whether the government wants to discourage the buildup of huge amounts of corporate debt that are central to leveraged buyouts, such as <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s recent record $ 24.53 billion agreement to buy <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In a leveraged buyout, investors go heavily into debt to buy out a company. The company than pays off the debt with its cash flow or by selling some of its assets. But deal makers questioned the feasibility of limiting LBO debt and said it would be difficult to define how much of a firm's interest payments are attributable to the cost of an acquisition <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, a partnr and LBO specialist at the law firm <ORGANIZATION> Gaston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Snow, said that even if LBO debt is limited acquirers would find ways around the restrictions. `` Instead of borrowing, you will use sale-leasebacks. You say, ` This is n't debt anymore,''' he said. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> also warned that too much tinkering with the corporate acquisition process could lead to unintended _ and unwanted _ consequences, such as increased ownership of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies by cash-rich foreigners. Past proposals to limit takeovers have had a devastating effect on Wall Street. In October 1987, congressional committees approved tax increase bills that some critics charged helped contribute to the stock market crash that month. The House version included provisions to sharply restrict the deduction for interest expenses incurred in takeovers. But observers generally doubted anything substantive would come out of this year's hearings. `` There'll be a lot of discussion, but in the end relatively little action,'' said one principal in a major Wall Street investment partnership who asked not to be identified. `` The only danger is that people get caught up in the theater of it all and they have some obligation to show some results,'' he said. `` That could be dangerous _ you could end up having stupid policy made.'' There may be skepticism now, but in 1988 deal makers who saw changes in the law looming on the horizon were n't taking any chances. Last year brought a storm of buyouts and bids _ including the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> deal _ and many securities analysts attributed the intense activity to acquirers trying to wrap up takeovers while the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration still was in office. The presidential election campaign brought a number of bipartisan calls for more reins on corporate takeover activity. The feeling on Wall Street is that the hearings and proposals have grown out of a backlash from the takeover battle for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>. `` The politicians feel some negative reaction to the amount of money being made on Wall Street and so there's a lot of curbing the LBO trend or curbing the acquisition trend,'' said the investment partnership principal. `` There is is sort of a public consensus to do something about <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>. `` The problem is, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> they have n't figured out what that something is.'' Another criticism is that any action would not only affect the big deals, but also the smaller, less highly-publicized buyouts that the observers say have benefited the country. `` The buyout business is n't something new,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, a principal with the investment firm <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerongen </PERSON>. `` They've turned out to be fairly good investments over the years.'' `` In not all, but in most cases, we've seen the productivity of the businesses improve,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> announced creation of a special panel Wednesday to strengthen control over floor transactions as a federal grand jury convened to probe allegations of fraud in the city's powerful financial futures industry. `` It matters not whether this -LRB- federal -RRB- investigation involves one member, or many members, of the exchanges,'' said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and special counsel to the exchange's board of governors. `` What matters is that we use this opportunity to act responsibly and make improvements where they are necessary,'' he added. `` There will be no sacred cows.'' The panel, which will be charged with reviewing trading procedures and practices and recommending changes where necessary, is made up of five industry officials and five former or current public officials, among them former Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. Earlier in the day, federal marshals sealed off the 16th floor of the downtown <ORGANIZATION> Everett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dirksen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> _ which in the past has been used for grand jury testimony _ and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>, in keeping with office policy, declined even to confirm that an investigation was under way. Meanwhile, several defense attorneys who advised clients to pass up government deals in exchange for cooperation complained of high-pressure prosecution tactics Wednesday as a federal grand jury convened to probe allegations of fraud in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s financial futures industry. The complaints came a day after 200 subpoenas were served on prominent brokers, traders and firms in a sweeping escalation of Operation Sourmash, a federal undercover investigation of corruption at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest futures exchanges. Federal marshals sealed off the 16th floor of the downtown <ORGANIZATION> Everett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dirksen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> _ which in the past has been used for grand jury testimony _ and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>, in keeping with office policy, declined even to confirm that an investigation was under way. The investigation, conducted by undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents posing as traders, reportedly centers on allegations that up to 100 brokers and traders cheated customers out of millions of dollars via shady dealings on the exchange floors. A number of well-known defense attorneys in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said they had been retained by traders at the two exchanges, and that subpoenas carried return dates of Wednesday or Feb. 1. Several attorneys complained that federal prosecutors, who accompanied <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents during late-night visits to some traders' homes last week, made veiled threats of confiscating property and other assets in hopes of enlisting the traders to cooperate, or provide information about others `` If the idea was to make some people sweat, they've accomplished that,'' said a former federal prosecutor, who is now a defense attorney and asked not be identified. `` But they might have gone too far in some instances. `` People are used to thinking in terms of a conspiracy ... crimes going up a ladder,'' said another attorney. `` What you really have here appears to be a series of discreet acts that did n't stretch beyond one or two people at a time. `` Building conspiracy and racketeering cases, and threatening to throw the book at people is n't going to make small catches any bigger.'' But <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Parenti </PERSON>, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice, said the subpoenas may signal a different tack. `` They might have run out of people they they can squeeze -LRB- information from -RRB- easily, and now they're looking for witnesses, not talkers. `` From here on out, anybody who's got exposure and goes in to see the grand jury is likely to be ` immunized' or already has cut a deal,'' he said. `` And it seems too early for either of those things to have been done.'' Initial news reports panicked trading circles and spurred quick sales of seats on the two exchanges, but by Wednesday some of the clouds cast by the probe over the two exchanges had dispersed. The exchanges reported sales of 32 full and associate seats through midday Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Prout </PERSON> said a trend that saw the value of full seats slip steadily from $ 410,000 last Thursday to $ 375,000 Monday had ended with a standing bid Wednesday to purchase a seat at $ 383,000. `` I'd be careful to read anything into this, especially at this early juncture,'' said <PERSON> Prout </PERSON>. `` There are many more things that can move the markets than a pending investigation.'' Similarly, trading volume in the soybean pits at the Board of Trade and the currency futures pits at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, both apparently targeted by federal investigators, were consistent with business-as-usual projections. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, said volume in the currency trading pits Tuesday, the last day for which full figures were available, totaled 143,698 contracts. That compared with 170,112 contracts traded Thursday and 111,284 traded Monday. <PERSON> Prout </PERSON> said that trading in soybeans Tuesday totaled 37,223 contracts Tuesday, compared to 46,463 contracts traded Thursday and 32,313 traded Monday.

<HEAD>Shell, Texaco Report Modest Fourth-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 fourth-quarter earnings rebounded from a multibillion dollar loss a year earlier, and <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s fourth-quarter earnings tumbled 51.4 percent from a year earlier, the petroleum giants said Wednesday <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 296 million, or $ 1.21 a share, in the period, vs. a $ 4.67 billion in losses a year earlier attributed to a restructuring and the settlement of a lawsuit with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> said earnings fell to $ 212 million in the quarter, down from $ 436 million in the same 1987 period. The company does not release per-share figures because it is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Shell President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said a recent rise in crude oil prices helped exploration and production performance but put pressure on refining and marketing costs. For the quarter ending Dec. 31, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> reported revenue of $ 8.47 billion, down 9.6 percent from $ 9.36 billion in revenue in the 1987 quarter. For the full year, the nation's third-largest oil company reported earnings of $ 1.3 billion, or $ 5.35 a share, on revenue of $ 35.1 billion, compared with losses of $ 4.14 billion on revenue of $ 35.3 billion in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said results from exploration and production in 1988 were hurt by low crude prices for most of the year and the loss of production in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> after a July platform explosion and fire. But financial results linked to oil refining and marketing were positive because of lower crude oil acquisition costs, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> said. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's sixth-largest oil company, said revenues for the quarter were $ 5.5 billion, down 7.2 percent from the $ 5.9 billion for the same year-ago period. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> had net income of $ 1.24 billion, a slight increase from the $ 1.23 billion in 1987. The annual earnings included a positive $ 35 million cumulative effect from prior years for accounting changes made in 1988, primarily for income taxes and capitalization of interest. Revenues for all of 1988 were $ 21.4 billion, compared with $ 21.2 billion in 1987.

 Two Harvard-educated brothers are struggling for control of the U-Haul rental empire founded by their father, who pioneered the self-trucking idea at the end of World War II and parlayed it into one of the country's biggest family-run businesses. The squabble has made <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Sam </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. `` Joe'' <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> look like the <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> and <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> of do-it-yourself moving. Both have allies among their 10 siblings and have sued each other in state and federal courts. At stake is the destiny of an operation with about 13,000 employees, $ 1 billion in annual revenue and a rental fleet of more than 100,000 trailers and 64,000 trucks, emblazoned with the orange-and-gray U-Haul logo commonly seen on interstates nationwide. The faction led by <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON>, a 40-year-old attorney with a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MBA </ORGANIZATION>, currently runs U-Haul and its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Amerco </ORGANIZATION>, which also has interests in other rental equipment, self-storage facilities and insurance. The company is incorporated in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> but most of its operations are based in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> and his allies won control via a stock maneuver last summer that gave them 53 percent voting power, partly through the issuance of shares to non-family executives who were on their side. The rival faction is led by <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON>, 43, a physician who also has an MBA from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. He quit as company president last summer because of frustration with family squabbling. He has since challenged the legality of his younger brother's stock maneuver, calling it a shabby move that cheated him and other shareholders <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON>'s group is supported by patriarch <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON>, 71, who had always wanted his eldest son to run U-Haul and has expressed dismay at what is happening to his family and the business under <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON>'s hand. He now believes the entire company should be sold and knows of a buyer willing to pay $ 1 billion, he said in an interview. He would n't identify the buyer. `` My son <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, I think, is incompetent,'' the U-Haul founder told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone this past week from his home in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. `` I'm not very pleased with his behavior.'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> said in an interview that his father was a genius who had taken the company through four decades of impressive growth, only to be undone by his children's rivalries. `` There's nothing very mysterious here,'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> said. `` I'm not going to imply that anybody has these particular problems, but the problems are power, control and greed. He said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON>'s weakness was the generosity that had prompted him to give each of his 12 children shares amounting to 95 percent of the stock in <LOCATION> Amerco </LOCATION>. `` My father had a dream, and his dream was that he would create this company, which he did, pass it on to his children, which he did, and that the children would work together, which they did for a time, and that it would be passed on to his grandchildren. `` It was a wonderful dream, but I do n't know of a single case where it's ever worked, not with the kind of ownership dispersion we have,'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> said. The company's leadership is now so convoluted, he said, that he also wants to sell it despite what he called the sentimental value attached to his father's American success story. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinefelter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Amerco </ORGANIZATION>'s secretary and general counsel, declined to arrange interviews with <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> or other members of the controlling faction until the outcome of court proceedings. But <PERSON> Klinefelter </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON>'s move to take control was crucial for the company's survival. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> struck a responsive chord in the American psyche in 1945, introducing a fleet of rental trailers about the time many soldiers and sailors were returning home and looking for jobs around the country. For many years U-Haul grew with almost no competition, operating out of franchised service stations. In 1968, <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> moved from <LOCATION> Ridgefield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, where he started U-Haul, to the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, basing the key operations in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. Things started to get tougher for him in 1973, when the oil crisis crimped vehicle use. Meanwhile, the U-Haul fleet was aging, zoning laws began restricting the location of rental trailers, and competitors began muscling in on the company's dominance. Complicating matters were the <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> descendants themselves, who by this decade had started vying for voices in the company. Unable to control it anymore, the father retired in the fall of 1986. Some say he was forced out by vindictive children. In <PERSON> Klinefelter </PERSON>'s view, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> helped save the business by reducing the average vehicle age to 7 years from 17 years, doubling the number of North American dealers to 7,500, scrapping a money-losing, full-service moving van venture and introducing a new 1-ton <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> pickup truck rental. The parent company is en route to record profits of $ 50 million on $ 1 billion in revenues for the 1988 fiscal year that began last April 1, <PERSON> Klinefelter </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> family ties had eroded long before the squabbling turned legal, he said. `` This has been a very decentralized family,'' he said. `` The range of ages of these children is 21 to 43, with two different mothers. Then there is a minor child by a third mother.'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> said his brother's group had done nothing unusual or innovative. He claimed their father started the modernization. `` The whole thing is a process,'' he said. `` It's just replacing older vehicles with newer ones.'' The underlying dispute, he said, `` is whether a minority of shareholders can issue stock to disenfranchise a majority. It's that simple.'' Despite the <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> family feud, the company has n't been hurt, at least not yet, securities analysts who follow transportation companies say. `` I do n't think there is any linkage between the family squabbles and the company's customer bases and demand for their product,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Trantum </PERSON>, who follows a key U-Haul competitor, <ORGANIZATION> Ryder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, for the <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bradford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. investment concern. `` Customers are interested in the state of the equipment and the price,'' <PERSON> Trantum </PERSON> said. `` They just want to move from here to there. You just go to a couple of outlets, check the prices and give the tires a kick. Then you take the best deal.''

 The president of <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>, has resigned unexpectedly to become president of <ORGANIZATION> Cowles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes history magazines and books, it was announced Wednesday. Little, 47, had been president of Newsweek for the past 2 -LCB- years, and said he is taking the new job because of his interest in history and the chance to live closer to his <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> farm. His resignation is effective March 1. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>, named no replacement for Little. `` I am surprised and disappointed to lose this able manager and colleague who has accomplished so much for <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said operating profits at <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>, a weekly newsmagazine, rose dramatically in 1988 and that circulation is at the highest level in history Newsweek circulation rose to 3.315 million in 1988, up from 3.097 million when <PERSON> Little </PERSON> took over as president. Little joined <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 as a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, and later became publisher of The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, the company's newspaper in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. He moved to <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> as chief financial officer five years ago and was named president of <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, succeeding <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmiston </PERSON> who resigned. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> vice chairman, and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, publisher, would report to him. <ORGANIZATION> Cowles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazines </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, publishes 14 magazines, including 10 history titles with combined circulation exceeding 1 million.

<HEAD>Bethlehem Reports Fourth Quarter Dip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Wednesday reported an 8 percent decline in fourth-quarter earnings, largely because of costs associated with rehabilating one plant and selling or shutting down others Specialty steelmaker <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, said Wednesday it enjoyed the best three months in company history with a 46 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings from $ 6.6 million, or 78 cents per share, to $ 9.6 million, or $ 1.12 per share. Fourth-quarter earnings for <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, the nation's third-largest steelmaker, fell from $ 71.5 million, or $ 1.07 per share, in 1987 to $ 65.7 million, or 79 cents per share. Sales climbed 10 percent from $ 1.20 billion to $ 1.33 billion. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> charged $ 35 million against fourth-quarter earnings to reflect increased operating costs at its <LOCATION> Burns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, where it rehabilitated a blast furnace. The company also took a $ 55 million charge to reflect losses on the sale of its remaining <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> coal operations and for costs associated with previous plant shutdowns. In 1988, a good year throughout the steel industry, the company earned $ 403 million, or $ 4.32 per share, up from $ 174.3 million, or $ 2.77 per share, in 1987. Sales rose from $ 4.62 billion to $ 5.49 billion. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> lost a total of more than $ 2 billion in the five years from 1982 through 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' quarterly sales rose 16.5 percent from $ 133.5 million to $ 155.6 million. The <LOCATION> Coatesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> company also set records with annual profits of $ 33.4 million, or $ 3.91 per share, up 54 percent from $ 21.6 million, or $ 2.58 per share in 1987. Sales rose 20 percent from $ 505.2 million to $ 605.3 million. `` Healthy shipments, near-capacity operating rates and increased transaction prices more than offset rising scrap prices,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> W.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> Chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> predicted a profitable first quarter this year but no surge in demand. `` We anticipate that steel consumption will remain relatively flat, and domestic steel shipments will decline since customers are not expected to build steel inventories as they did in 1988,'' he said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> projected 1989 industry shipments at 77 million tons, down from the estimated 83 million tons shipped in 1988. `` We face a number of issues in 1989 which must be satisfactorily resolved if we are to continue our progress in achieving sustained profitability and rebuilding a sound financial base,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` We must negotiate a ... new agreement which will permit <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> to continue to remain competitive with other steel producers both domestic and foreign,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s contract with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> union expires July 21. The major producers are also pressing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to fulfill his promise to renew the five-year voluntary steel import quotas due to expire in September. `` We are relying on that commitment,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` The basic international conditions that required the policy _ excessive global capacity in steel and unfair trade in our market _ have not been corrected.'' He said a five-year extension of the policy is essential. `` The steel industry has not yet achieved an adequate and sustained level of profitability,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said.

 Sales of existing single-family homes last year hit their highest level since 1979 as buyers shopped in lower price ranges rather than leave the market when costs rose, a real estate trade group said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said 3.63 million homes were sold in 1988, up 2.9 percent from 1987 when 3.53 million homes had been sold. It was the highest sales volume since 3.83 million homes were sold in 1979. Sales shot up 11.4 percent in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.09 million units. It was the highest month-to-month increase since an 11.6 percent rise in April 1986. `` For the most part, people seem to be buying less-expensive homes,'' said <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON>, president of the Realtors group. `` The demand is there. People still appear to be going for the most they can afford. They just ca n't afford as much.'' Home prices slipped slightly to $ 87,700 in December compared with a median sales price of $ 88,000 in November. Prices averaged $ 89,100 for all of 1988, a 4.1 percent increase from the previous year, when the median sales price was $ 85,600. `` The strong sales volume of December, combined with a decline in prices from November and overall modest price increases for the year, suggest that the demand for home ownership is being fulfilled at the lower end of the market,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the Realtors. He predicted similar buying patterns this year, but cautioned that with mortgage interest rates expected to continue rising, `` economic conditions are not favorable to draw a large volume of sales.'' Interest on fixed-rate mortgages averaged 10.71 percent last week, according to a national survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Economist <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Obrinsky </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION> credited the strong 1988 home sales to the general health of the nation's economy. `` There is an underlying demand for housing that's fueled by visions of home ownership but also by the economic reality of an economy still in its expansion phase,'' he said. `` Relatively good economic conditions are, at bottom, what's responsible for a fairly strong level of homes sales despite slightly higher interest rates.'' He predicted there would be a slight decline in home sales during 1989 as interest rates continue to rise early in the year and economic growth slows later in the year. Prices were up in 1988 in all regions of the country, with the fastest rate increase coming in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, where prices rose 9.3 percent from 1987 to reach a median of $ 123,700 last year. The Northeast continued to have the highest sales prices of any region, a median of $ 143,100 in 1988, up 7.4 percent from a year earlier. Home prices rose 2.4 percent in the South to a median of $ 82,300 in 1988, while prices were up 3.5 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to a median of $ 68,300. The 11.4 percent sales increase nationwide in December followed two months where sales held even at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.67 million units. <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> said the figures revealed a shift in purchases from the more expensive Northeast to less-costly markets in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and South. December's increase in sales was led by a 15.8 percent increase in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where sales ose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.61 million homes. Sales were up 10.4 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where an economic revival is under way, to an annual rate of 1.06 million homes. In the West, sales rose 4.5 percent to 690,000 units, and sales were up 4.4 percent in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> to 710,000 dwellings.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its president has resigned amid differences over the direction of the giant health care company at a time it is faced with sagging sales of its blockbuster ulcer drug and takeover rumors. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebright </PERSON>'s resignation coincided with the release of <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings, which showed a 60 percent drop in the company's 1988 profit. <PERSON> Ebright </PERSON>'s resignation is effective immediately, the company said. His duties will be assumed by <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> and I have had differences on matters of corporate policy. Nevertheless, I accept his resignation with deep regret,'' <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. He added that <PERSON> Ebright </PERSON> `` has played a major role in the diversification of <PERSON> SmithKline </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON> and the building of our businesses.'' <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> said its fourth-quarter net income rose 12 percent to $ 159.4 million, or $ 1.28 a share, from $ 141.9 million, or $ 1.14 a share in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue rose to $ 1.3 billion from $ 1.2 billion in the 1987 period. The fourth-quarter figures were bolstered by income from the partial spinnoff of <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>, which brought in $ 46.1 million, the company said. Analysts said <PERSON> Ebright </PERSON>'s abrupt resignation probably stemmed from differences with <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON> over the future direction of the company. `` Mr. <PERSON> Ebright </PERSON> was probably in favor of retaining control at the top and Mr. <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON> was probably in favor of more independence of the units,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordmann </PERSON>, a stock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ebright </PERSON>, who also was chief operating officer, stood to loose responsibility with any independence given to the individual units, <PERSON> Nordmann </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ebright </PERSON>, 51, who became president April 1987, joined the company in 1963 in the accounting department. <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON>, 55, became chairman the same month, 32 years after joining <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>'s international marketing division. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> `` has strong managers in place at the corporate level and in our operating units, and I am confident of their ability to lead our business into the future,'' <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON> said. Management has been under fire from critics who charge <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> has failed to introduce a follow-up to its leading prescription ulcer medication, Tagamet, as it has faced increased competition from London-based <ORGANIZATION> Glaxo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>'s Zantac. On the year, <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>'s profit fell 60 percent to $ 229.2 million, or $ 1.84 a share, from $ 570.1 million, or $ 4.50 a share, the company reported. Its sales rose 10 percent to $ 4.7 billion from $ 4.3 billion in 1987. The yearly figures included a $ 389.3 million charge associated with a corporate restructuring announced in September. Pharmaceutical sales were down 14 percent in the fourth quarter, with Tagamet and high-blood pressure medication Dyazide sales described as being down `` sharply.'' Tagamet's sales for the year were $ 1.020 billion. A number of Wall Street analysts have labled <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> a takeover target and, largely on the basis of rumors of an imminent offer, its stock has fluctuated widely in the past months. The company's stock price was up 12.5 cents to 50 | Tuesday and in early trading today went up $ 1.25 The company's breakup value has been estimated at $ 75 to $ 91 per share. The restructuring announced in September was viewed by many analysts as an attempt to fend off possible suitors. But many said the partial spinoff of <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> was not enough and <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON> hinted in September that similar steps might be applied to their <ORGANIZATION> Allergan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bio-Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries. The company has said partial spinoffs would focus stock market attention on the value of the subsidiaries and, thus, increase SmithKline's value. Analysts said today's resignation likely signals more partial spinoffs within the corporation. <ORGANIZATION> Allergan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bio-Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> are likely candidates for such a move.

 <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors on Wednesday authorized the purchase of up to 20 million shares of common stock in an effort to improve the stock's value, the company announced. At the current value of <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> stock, the purchase would be worth around $ 2 billion. The proposed purchase represents about 8 percent of the company's common shares. <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>'s stock rose $ 2.12 -LCB- to $ 98.50 a share Wednesday in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. The board also declared a first-quarter dividend of $ 1.05 per share on outstanding common stock, an increase of 10 cents from the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 1988. The dividend was last raised nine months ago. Under the repurchasing program, shares will be bought on the open market, or through privately negotiated transactions, at prevailing market rates from time to time. `` This buyback program is another step in our efforts to improve the overall return to shareholders without jeopardizing our financial strength or sacrificing growth opportunities that may present themselves,'' said Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckert </PERSON>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice on Wednesday allowed the resumption of a stock manipulation trial of <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its vice chairman.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s invitation to possible buyers is a ploy to delay <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION>'s attempted $ 260 billion takeover bid and that the company's main goal is to remain independent. `` I think they're stalling to see whether they can find another alternative and they're holding some remote hope of remaining independent. I think their principal objective has been to remain independent,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer at Coastal. `` They talk about studying the idea of auctioning the company, but they have n't said they're going to do it. In fact, to date they have n't taken any specific action except to stall,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. However, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday they already have started scheduling appointments witth possible buyers, and denied <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s suggestion that their contacts with more than 50 possible suitors is meant to delay a <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> takeover by propping up stock prices. `` The process is well under way,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wichlep </PERSON>. `` We have set up data rooms here in our building and have already started making appointments with representatives of other companies to come in and review our data and to hear presentations by officers of the company,'' he said. Trading in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> was suspended briefly on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday after a company lawyer told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> the company might use a `` white knight'' to block the Coastal bid and has a list of more than 50 possible buyers. Coastal officials later suggested that the comment was designed to inflate stock prices and make their $ 42-a-share offer appear inadequate. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> officials say the number is legitimate and was provided in court only to inform <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> of their actions, but they acknowledge that they are trying to maximize stock values. `` This is a bona fide effort in our ongoing process to determine the maximum value of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> stock,'' <PERSON> Wichlep </PERSON> said Wednesday. During the three-hour court hearing Tuesday, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> denied a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> request to delay a Feb. 7 hearing date in a Coastal lawsuit designed to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> from using any anti-takeover measures. <PERSON> Wichlep </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would not discuss the number of companies planning visits to the company's <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> headquarters or when they were expected. All companies are being asked to sign confidentiality agreements, he said. Analysts and industry officials expressed doubt Wednesday that there may be a large number of serious contenders to take over the Houston-based natural gas company. <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Arkla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Resources all have reportedly turned down requests to enter the bidding. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the nation's largest natural gas transmission system and long had been considered a possible candidate for a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> takeover, will not say whether it is talking to the company. Others cited as possible suitors include Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>. British <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> is said to have an interest in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION>'s considerable oil and natural gas reserves in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said his company has asked <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> for information that would justify a higher offer than its $ 42-a-share cash bid, but said the only response has been `` rhetoric and a stonewall meeting last Sunday.'' The meeting between executives of the two Houston-based natural gas companies was the only face-to-face contact to occur since Coastal's takeover bid was announced Jan. 16.

 <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, better known as <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday its fourth-quarter earnings dipped slightly from the previous year but that its profit for all of 1988 rose 2 percent. The company reported net income of $ 78 million, or $ 1.13 per share, in the final quarter of 1988 compared with $ 79 million, or $ 1.15 a share, a year earlier. Fourth-quarter revenue rose 7.6 percent to $ 904 million from $ 840 million in 1987. Discounting the tax benefits carried over from the company's previous ownership by the government, <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> said it had earned $ 75 million, or $ 1.09 per share, in the fourth quarter of 1987 The government sold the railroad in a public offering March 1987. `` Last October, we cautioned that it would be difficult to match our fourth-quarter 1987 performance, which had benefitted from substantial increases in coal and steel traffic. In fact, we registered a solid quarter, essentially equaling traffic volume,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> reported it earned $ 306 million, or $ 4.44 per share, on revenues of $ 3.49 billion, up from net income of $ 299 million, or $ 4.34 per share, on revenues of $ 3.25 billion in 1987. The company's profits in 1987, however, were enhanced by capital loss tax credits and depreciation deductions. In light of the discontinued tax benefits, the company posted a 22.4 percent increase over 1987 net income of $ 250 million, or $ 3.62 per share. `` Our continued strong performance in 1988 shows our ability to attract and transport higher volumes of freight traffic, while continuing to control costs,'' <PERSON> Sanborn </PERSON> said. The company carried 0.4 percent more freight in the fourth quarter of 1988, compared with the same period for 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> said. For the year, traffic was up 6.2 percent, the company said.

 The parent of <ORGANIZATION> Gibraltar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it expected to lose more than $ 30 million in its latest quarter, and revealed it is discussing a supervisory agreement with federal thrift regulators. <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, one of the nation's biggest savings and loans, has been losing money for at least two years, in part because of expansion into commercial lending and real estate development. <ORGANIZATION> Gibraltar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, holding company for the thrift, said losses in the quarter ended Dec. 31 are expected to be between $ 30 million and $ 35 million.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> announced plans Wednesday for a fully computerized production system by 1992 that an analyst said would make it the nation's most technologically advanced newspaper. Pagination, as the process is called, will eliminate the need for typesetting, layout and paste-up operations and allow faster, more efficient handling of news and better picture quality. The newspaper has chosen <ORGANIZATION> Crosfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION>, a computer systems developer, to install the full-color electronic publishing system for $ 13.5 million. If it is successful, the Sun would be the first newspaper in the country to have complete pagination, according to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, a Washington-based newspaper industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. Many newspapers have plans for full pagination and a few already are using the process for classified advertising, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said. All words _ stories, headlines, photo captions, advertising copy, etc. _ will be written, edited and positioned on a dummy page on a computer terminal. Photographs need not be produced as prints in a darkroom. In technology known as electronic darkrooms, images are stored as electrical impulses that can be enlarged or shrunk, cropped, lightened or darkened on a terminal. Pagination is just the latest in a series of evolutionary changes in the printing industry, which not so long ago relied on hot lead type that was melted and reused for each edition. `` It will spell the end of what's left of the composing room,'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Basoco </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president and general manager, said the system will eliminate two-thirds of the current 150 composing room jobs, significantly reducing labor costs. However, workers' contracts guarantee them lifetime job security, so employment will be reduced only through attrition. Remaining workers will be offered transfers and retraining. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Typographers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 12 at the Sun, said pagination was inevitable. `` Automation is trial and error,'' <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON> said. `` They might talk about pagination but who knows whether it's going to work.'' <PERSON> Basoco </PERSON> said the new system, combined with new color presses, would enable the Sun to increase its use of color and to produce itself the work on its Sunday magazine now performed by jobbers. Crosfield, of <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, is the North American operation of <ORGANIZATION> Crosfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, an English company owned by <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest nongovernment currency and security printer.

 A West German newspaper says a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> provided financing for an Iraqi poison gas factory in the mid-1980s and 30 Soviet experts helped build it. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Laubscher </PERSON>, spokesman for the American company, said: `` It's an outrageous lie <PERSON> Bechtel </PERSON> did not build, design or finance anything of the kind in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> during that period. `` We have never participated in any such project, nor would we ever.'' The left-leaning <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Tageszeitung </ORGANIZATION>, in a report released Wednesday and scheduled for publication Thursday, said it had a list of 31 foreign companies and 18 banks and financial institutions allegedly involved. <ORGANIZATION> Tageszeitung </ORGANIZATION> said it obtained the list from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a group opposed to the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government. It said the list was compiled by an official Iraqi agency. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper said the list contained names of companies in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> that `` directly or indirectly participated'' in building a mustard gas plant in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Seven West German companies were named in the report, but <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> was the only name of a foreign firm included. According to <ORGANIZATION> Tageszeitung </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> `` in cooperation with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, helped finance the building'' of the plant beginning in 1984.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday his administration is considering charging depositors to help pay for the savings and loan crisis, but members of his own party in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> quickly stuck a pin in the trial balloon. `` I'm not going to say what I'm going to do, but that is one option,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview with two reporters. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, in television interviews Wednesday morning, said a proposal under review by his department would impose an insurance fee of 25 cents for every $ 100 in deposits. But, he stressed that the option has not been forwarded yet to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> did not say how the fee would be collected, but his spokesman, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddon </PERSON>, said the fee could be imposed directly on depositors, or it could be paid by the institutions as an increase in the insurance premium they already pay. The fee, or premium, would apply to all federally insured financial institutions: banks, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls and credit unions, <PERSON> Siddon </PERSON> said. Meantime, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> is preparing a report which says that some of the nation's largest accounting firms failed to uncover fraud and mismanagement at S & amp; Ls, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Thursday editions. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, examined the audits of a dozen failed S & amp; Ls which were given `` clean audits'' _ meaning no problems were found _ shortly before the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls went under, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in an interview, appeared to dispute a suggestion the fee could be considered a tax, thus violating his `` Read my lips: No new taxes'' pledge. `` I will answer the question with a question. Is -LRB- it -RRB- a tax when the person pays the fee to go to <LOCATION> Yosemite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, using the park? ... There will be a lively debate on this,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, White House chief of staff, said an increase in deposit insurance premiums `` does not pass the duck test and therefore is not a tax.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> was referring to a statement by Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, who told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that if a proposed revenue increase was widely perceived by the public as a tax increase it would not be proposed, saying, `` If it looks like a duck ... it's a duck.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> suggested that the option under consideration could be considered a `` modernization'' of deposit insurance premiums, which historically have proved to be too low. Federal regulators pledged more than $ 38 billion last year to close 205 insolvent S & amp; Ls. More than 350 other insolvent institutions remain open and billions of dollars more will be required. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is working on a plan for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that would raise money and institute reforms to prevent the problem from reoccurring. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could select a plan as early as next week. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said they have been contacted by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials over the last week or so seeking their reaction to a variety of money-raising ideas. One option would impose a user fee on mortgage borrowers. Others involve various ways to borrow the money, either on or off budget, with the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> paying the interest. But the deposit fee option, reported in Wednesday editions of The Washington Post, stirred a furor in the industry and in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The Post, quoting unidentified sources, said the fee could raise $ 9 billion a year, which would cover interest payments on the $ 20 billion to $ 30 billion the government will have to raise for several years. `` The thing is dead on arrival for one reason: It puts an imposition of a burden on the depositor and creates an unlevel playing field against insured financial institutions,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` I have n't found one member who thought it had any merit,'' <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> said, warning that the fee could send deposits flowing into money market mutual funds and other uninsured investments offered by brokerage firms. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> banking panel, called the idea `` incredibly ill-advised. `` I will only vote for this idea posthumously and only then if someone casts by proxy against my direct wishes expressed in my last will and testament,'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said. `` I think it's one of the more absurd ideas that has come down the pike,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a banking committee member. `` At a time when we're trying to encourage people to save, to penalize them is nonsensical. ... Politically it's going to be blown out of the water.'' However, other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said the trial balloon should not be summarily dismissed. `` I think it underscores how bad all the alternatives are,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>. `` The nature of the solutions is they are going to be uncomfortable. All will pinch. ... Our choices are potentially increasing taxes, potentially increasing the budget deficit or some sort of deposit insurance premium increase.'' `` You have to ask yourself what is the least obnoxious of all the alternatives,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` I do n't think it should be precluded at this time. Some people want to put their heads in the sand and pretend there's no problem or pretend it wo n't be costly to solve But there's no free lunch.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> executives, in particular, promised to lobby hard against the idea. `` Taxing bank customers to bail out the savings and loan industry would be a gross injustice. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> was n't asked to bail out <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> was n't asked to bail out <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugger </PERSON>, chief economist of the association, warned that customers would end up paying even if the institution paid the fee rather than the depositor. `` One of the things that will happen is that interest rates on deposits will have to go down if the tax is collected through the banks. A 5 -LCB- percent rate will become something like 5 percent,'' he said.
