 President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> marked the 14th anniversary of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s Marxist revolution Monday with a brief address devoted to the nation's longstanding civil war in the north. Government troops and civilians mobilized since the conflict intensified in March are `` presently engaged in a bitter fight,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> told the thousands of people packed into the capital's downtown Revolution Square His forces claim to have repulsed insurgencies in its northernmost province, <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>'s southern neighbor, <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> says it has retaken all major cities and towns since the rebels overran the region in April and May. No major engagements have been reported with the separatist <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> since the government in May said its forces had foiled rebel attempts to take the strategic city of <LOCATION> Keren </LOCATION>, 56 miles northwest of the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>. However, <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> said the rebels were sabotaging and endangering the lives of all citizens and hampering the development of public and private institutiones. The task ahead `` is clearly an arduous one,'' he said in his 20-minute address. The Eritrean guerrillas have been fighting a separatist battle for 27 years in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s longest civil war. In <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tigray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> took up arms 14 years ago demanding greater autohomy for their region. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> inherited the insurgencies when he and a clique of military men dethroned <LOCATION> Emperor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Selassie </LOCATION> in 1974 and replaced the emperor's 44-year feudal reign with a Marxist government. One day before last year's anniversary of the revolution, the provisional military government which had ruled since the revolution was replaced by a <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> which has a popularly elected legislature. However, power still sits with <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> who has ruled <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> since Feb. 12, 1977. In his speech, <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> also referred to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s unusually good rains this year and expressed confidence that if the wet weather continues, the nation `` will, in a short time, be free of food shortages which have made us the butt of an unhealthy comment.'' The Horn of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> nation suffers chronic droughts which in 1984-85 led to a famine that killed an estimated 1 million people and sparked the largest international relief effort in history. Rains failed again in 1987 causing widespread crop failures that threatened an estimated 3.2 million people with starvation in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Union Leaders Call Off 13-Day-Old Mail Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Union leaders ended <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 13-day mail strike Monday, but home and international service will remain disrupted for two weeks as workers wade through a backlog of 150 million letters and packages, officials said. The national executive board of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 180,000 <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> employees, announced its support Monday for a pact to end the walkout, said spokesman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Slater </PERSON>. `` The objective by both sides should be to return to work by Thursday,'' <PERSON> Slater </PERSON> said. The 100,000 striking workers will iron out return-to-work details with managers at local post offices, he said. `` This has been an extremely damaging dispute for our customers,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cockburn </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letters </ORGANIZATION>, the letters and parcels division of the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a mountain of mail, and there will be an all-out effort to move it.'' Union Secretary-General <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuffin </PERSON> said local union chiefs will forge their own deals on overtime and the use of temporary workers. `` We are going to try to get this industry back on its feet with the cooperation of the workforce,'' he said in a TV news broadcast on Channel Four. <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> leaders agreed to a back-to-work plan last Thursday, but <PERSON> Tuffin </PERSON> said he wanted `` no misunderstanding'' and sent his negotiators back to the table over the weekend. Monday's agreement also establishes a framework for further discussions on the strike's central issue of regional pay supplements. <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Corfield </PERSON> said local managers may press returning strikers to accept a number of temporary employees to cope with the `` Christmas-like'' volume of mail. International mail, first-class letters and parcels will receive priority as the backlog is cleared, said Ms. <PERSON> Corfield </PERSON>. Public mailboxes, which have been sealed throughout the dispute, will reopen `` only when we can guarantee people normal service again,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> wishes to pay bonuses to new workers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where the cost of living is high and retaining workers proves difficult. The union demanded that the bonuses be paid across the country or not all and began a 24-hour work stoppage Aug. 31 that burgeoned into a series of crippling wildcat strikes. <PERSON> Tuffin </PERSON> said a deal could be reached over the pay issue within six weeks. About half of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 1,500 local post offices closed down during the strike and of the 82 major sorting centers, only one, in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, was open for business before the agreement was announced Monday, said Ms. <PERSON> Corfield </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said it will lift its sanctions against communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Friday, the day before the Summer Olympics open in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, `` in the friendly and generous spirit appropriate to a festival of peace.'' The decision was announced Tuesday, a day after an opposition leader returning from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> government was willing to free two Japanese seamen detained for more than four years on spying charges. <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> leaders wanted to improve North Korean-Japanese relations. The relations were ruptured when <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> imposed the sanctions early this year after <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>'s alleged bombing of a South Korean passenger flight near <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> denied involvement in the disaster, which killed all 115 people aboard the aircraft last November. Japanese sanctions included restrictions on contact between Japanese and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officials. `` Since that time, domestic and foreign interest in preventing the recurrence of terrorism has reached an unprecedentedly high level, indicating that the aim of showing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s firm attitude against terrorism has been achieved,'' the chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary, <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON>, said in a statement following a Cabinet meeting Tuesday morning. <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will lift the sanctions `` from the viewpoint that the Games may be conducted with the utmost possible relaxation of tension and in the friendly and generous spirit appropriate to a festival of peace.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is a major ally of pro-Western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and maintains no official diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has sought help from third parties, including the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, in winning the freedom of <PERSON> Isamu </PERSON> <PERSON> Beniko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuriura </PERSON>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> detained the two seamen in 1983 on unspecified espionage charges.

 A businessman is leaping to fill the gap created by dropping supplies of bullfrogs, whose legs are consumed as a cripsy delicacy in the South. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Maghan </PERSON> was almost hopping in anticipation Monday of an experimental program to raise the big, hopping amphibians. `` It's not really even off the ground yet. But we're pretty excited,'' the owner of <ORGANIZATION> Stillashak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION> on the Gulf Coast. `` If you look what has been done in this state for the shrimp, oyster, striped bass and redfish industies, there's no reason it ca n't be done for frog legs,'' <PERSON> Maghan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Maghan </PERSON> said that three years ago he was paying $ 2.15 to $ 2.20 a pound for frog legs. The price is now about $ 4.06 per pound. `` I have been quoted as much as $ 5 to $ 5.10. That goes to show you that the market is way up. Three years ago, I was getting about six to eight pair of legs to the pound. Now, its about four to six pairs per pound. `` But we are also looking at the remnants of supplies, and those are depleting fast,'' he said. <PERSON> Maghan </PERSON> said in 1986-87, more than 8.6 million pounds of frog legs came into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. He said the market could be as much as 10 million pounds. But <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> have put a five-year moratorium on such exports, he said. `` They -LRB- the bullfrogs -RRB- are wild over there and they have taken so many of them that the insect problem has increased, so they are n't shipping any more. `` But I believe there is no reason why <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> ca n't raise all the frogs we need,'' he said. <PERSON> Maghan </PERSON> said the adult frogs eat insects, but he's trying to come up with a feed that will increase their size and growth. He plans to start with tadpoles and raise them all the way to adults. `` It is a long process,'' <PERSON> Maghan </PERSON> said. `` It is not something we expect to do overnight. We expect to raise the critters in a pond, but everything else is still up in the air.''

 An F-14 Tomcat jet fighter crashed in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> Monday, and one crewman was killed and the other missing, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. A fishing vessel, Jo-Boy II, managed to pick up one crewman, but he was pronounced dead when he arrived by helicopter at <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, authorities said. A search continued late Monday for the second flier. The F-14 based at <LOCATION> Oceana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, went down 22 miles east of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman P.E. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>. The plane, part of <LOCATION> Oceana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fighter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 143 </ORGANIZATION>, was practicing air combat maneuvers with several other planes, said Lt.

The identities of the dead man and the missing man were withheld pending notification of relatives. Two charter boat captains carrying fishing parties watched from several miles away as the F-14 hit the water. `` I saw a streak of flame and a great big fireball about 500 feet from the surface,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallop </PERSON>, captain of the Mighty Wind, which is based at the Oregon Inlet Fishing Center. `` I heard an explosion and I could see stuff flying through the air.

 Both accidents were blamed on pilot error. Experts say hard evidence rarely exists to show pilots erred because they were tired. `` The problem with fatigue is it's not a bent piece of metal. It's not a liquid that can be analyzed in the laboratory,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohler </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> official who heads aerospace medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Government and airline officials acknowledge they've heard tales of pilots napping in flight and of mistakes attributed to sleepiness, but they play down such reports. `` There is n't evidence that there is a fatigue problem,'' said <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group representing the major airlines. <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, says more research is needed into the effects of long flights on the circadian system, or biological clock. But he denies a safety problem. `` There's no evidence that shows it makes flying any more hazardous,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said. Some 600 accounts of missed approaches, near misses and near tragedies blamed on fatigue show up in voluntary pilot reports filed with the Air Safety Reporting System, an office run by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> for pilots who want to confess to mistakes and report risky conditions without fear of retribution. Enough reports were filed by crews for commuter airlines and air taxis that the <ORGANIZATION> ASRS </ORGANIZATION> sent a memo to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> in May identifying `` recurring pilot deviations directly attributable to fatigue and cockpit workload.'' `` The big chunk that we have perceived out of this information is that fatigue is a real issue that needs to be addressed,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynard </PERSON>, who runs the reporting system. Even though the reports are protected by anonymity and are not investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> ASRS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reynard </PERSON> believes they are truthful. `` It is absolutely, positively valid that these numbers are real,'' he said. `` Our analysts have been in aviation for 20 to 30 years. They are very good at spotting a ringer.'' The reports provide a litany of horror stories: _ In February 1987, the co-pilot of a cross-country jumbo jet already descending into <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> looks up from his coffee cup to see the captain asleep at the controls. `` I think we need to look at the world of the pilot and see what more hours and labor unrest is doing,'' he writes. _ The next month a large airliner from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> sinks 4,000 feet below its assigned altitude, coming close enough to another plane to set off alarms at the air traffic control center. `` I do not believe it would have occurred to a rested crew,'' writes a crewmember, noting he flew all night to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> then continued to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> into the morning sun. `` Duty regulations.. do not in any way address the debilitating effects of flying all night and especially of continuing to work into the morning hours.'' _ Last November the co-pilot of another large jet begins a takeoff roll from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> without setting the flaps, an error then already suspected in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 crash in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> that had killed 154 people three months earlier. Cockpit warning horns sound and takeoff is aborted. In the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> crash, the horns failed to sound. `` It is quite sobering to consider that the combination of fatigue and distractions could so easily cause a breakdown in my own cockpit discipline,'' writes the co-pilot, who had flown for three days with little sleep. `` Complacency was not a factor,'' he writes. `` Simple fatigue was the culprit.'' That incident affords a good look at the shadowy effects of fatigue. Planes do n't crash because pilots are tired, say the experts. Fatigue becomes a killer only when something else _ equipment or the weather _ goes wrong as well. If, for example, the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> flight's warning horns had failed, as they did in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, the tired pilot's oversight could have been fatal. In the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> crash, there was no evidence fatigue played a role. On paper, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> flight rules seem favorable to pilots. Domestic pilots are limited to eight hours' flight time a day; overseas pilots fly no more than 12. All pilots must get at least eight hours of rest between flight sequences. However, the regulations count only scheduled flight time, not the hours spent on the ground between flights. So scheduled turnarounds and unscheduled delays can push a crew's day up to 16 hours. Scheduling agreements between airlines and pilots once kept flight hours well below federal standards, but concessions to management have become commonplace amid the fierce competition brought on by deregulation. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said that 10 years ago, at the start of deregulation, the typical contract limited flight time to a maximum of 75 to 80 hours per month. Today, he says, it's 80-85 hours. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> pilots, who lost their contract when the company reorganized in 1983, now fly 20 percent more hours a month. The company says its flight hours are still well under the industry average. `` Our ... work rules remove the anti-productivity aspects to allow reasonable productivity,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>. Northwest pilots complain their company has interpreted regulations to allow international crews flying home to take on additional domestic flights, adding up to four flight hours to their day. Northwest, citing ongoing negotiations with the pilots, declined to comment. When <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> routes in 1986, its pilots faced extended flight hours and reduced crew size on the longer routes. A separate contract added a day of work each month. `` The Pan Am guys had a cushy job, but the company fell on hard times,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferg </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s director of flight operations. `` We're trying to strike a balance between what's fair and equitable for the pilots and what's economical.'' Many pilots interviewed complain the scales are tipped too far toward economics at the expense of safety. `` I've got 400 people in that airplane and I take it very seriously,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> 747 pilot. `` It's a responsibility, and you know this is n't good for the passengers.''

 Asians are keeping a close eye on an immigration debate in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to see if it will mean a slow down in the flow of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> emigrants into the country. Some Asians say they see signs of racism. Several Asian newspapers have published editorials reminding <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> of its growing economic links with <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries. `` The outcome of the intense immigration debate now under way in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> will either confirm or confound the view Asians hold that a strong undercurrent of racism exists in the ` Lucky Country','' the conservative English-language <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> said. `` While <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> was founded on British values, the facts today are that politically and economically the country can not always look West.'' In <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, a growing influx of Asian migrants is in the background of a debate over immigration rules and multi-culturalism _ a policy that encourages migrants to keep cultural links with their homelands. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, says immigration from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> should be slowed in the interests of social harmony and that immigrants should embrace the English-speaking majority's Anglo-Saxon cultural values. `` I am not saying I would end Asian immigration,'' he said. `` But what I am saying is that it is a legitimate concern of any community and any government to say that it is imposing social tensions and that it is imposing a lack of social cohesion.'' The government has proposed legislation that would prohibit the use of race or ethnic origins as criteria for judging potential immigrants' acceptability. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, who heads a two-party national opposition, is against the bill but has lost support recently in Parliament. Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has vowed to fight any move to restrict <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> immigration and says he would maintain a policy of non-discrimination even if he thought it would mean losing an election. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, a continent with only 16 million people near <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s huge population of 3 billion, is an attractive destination for emigrants It is called `` lucky'' because of its rich resources and comfortable climate. The Australian Bureau of Statistics says the number of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> immigrants climbed by one-third in the past year. Out of 116,430 immigrants between January and November 1987, 47,450 were Asians, compared with 36,360 in the same period in 1986. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> has taken in 100,000 Vietnamese since 1975, when the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war ended, and has a growing Chinese community. Emigration counselors in several <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries list <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> as attractive for its climate, proximity and educational opportunities for children. Increasing numbers of Asians with capital and business experience are snowing interest in emigrating to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> now surpassed <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the top choice of emigrants. `` People here barely knew anything about <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> three years ago,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, manager of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Queter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, which handles emigration applications to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` But emigrating to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> has become a fad now.'' <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said he understood why <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> had doubled the capital requirement for business emigrants to 500,000 Australian dollars -LRB- $ 410,000 -RRB- in the past year. `` <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> no longer needs foreign capital and personnel now as much as before. It is only natural that it closes the door a bit.'' In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, where emigration is on the upswing due to nervousness over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s taking sovereignty of the British colony in 1997, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is the second most popular destination after <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Sekavs </PERSON>, regional migration director in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s Consulate in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, said 6,431 Filipinos emigrated to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> in 1986, compared with 5,140 from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and 5,032 from <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ka-wai </PERSON>, editor of The Emigrant, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s magazine on emigration, said he thought the number of emigration applications would remain high even if <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> imposes new curbs. `` <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is strange,'' <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> said. `` It is in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> but it does not treat itself as an Asian country. It is a multi-racial country and economically it should have the potential to accept more people.'' <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse </PERSON>, migration service manager of Price Waterhouse emigration consultancy in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, said, `` It would be racist if <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> refuses Asians. But from my nine years' experience in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, I have not felt any racism and am not sure if it is just over-exaggeration by the press.'' The fiercest reaction has come from a <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> newspaper, the Star in <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>, where editor V.K. <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> wrote in a recent column that Australians he described as racists make <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> immigrants `` feel inadequate, insecure and even sub-human.'' `` Based on the statements of some of these pillars of the Australian political establishment, it would appear that inside every Liberal senator or member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is a racist struggling to get out,'' <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> wrote. `` <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> may be a big, wide-open country but it is in danger of being led by small-minded people with petty prejudices and attitudes more suited to the Victorian age.''

 For years, Republican <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s lone member of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, has enjoyed the backing of many state Democrats. Two years ago, he even won re-election with both the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic nominations. This year, though, as <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> seeks the seat of retiring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, R-Vt., his popularity among Democrats is being used against him by <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> challenger <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON>, who calls himself the real Republican in the race <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> will face off next Tuesday in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s Republican primary The winner will face Democrat <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, in the November election. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is unopposed in Tuesday's Democratic primary. <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> is the clear favorite in the primary, but his support of Democratic initiatives over the years has angered many of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> faithful, including former four-term Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Snelling </PERSON>, who donated $ 1,000 to the <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON> campaign. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, while he clearly has provided a long service to <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, has not, in my opinion, been very often mindful of the fact that he gets his nominations from the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Snelling </PERSON>, himself considered a moderate to liberal. While <PERSON> Snelling </PERSON> was willing to give money to <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON>, he withheld his formal endorsement, saying the 35-year-old political newcomer had not `` sufficiently established his credentials.'' And that is clearly <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON>' weak point. While <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, 54, has lived his life in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and served as a state senator, attorney general and member of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON> had lived in the state only a year or so in the 1970s before returning here this spring to challenge <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>. He served in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and then worked for <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a major defense contractor, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He said he decided to move back to <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> to challenge <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> when the congressman was the only Republican in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last fall to vote for a $ 12 billion deficit-reduction measure backed by the Democratic leadership on a crucial 206-205 vote. That vote was only one of the many times <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> has broken party ranks. In 1981, he was the sole House Republican to vote against President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tax-cut package. In 1987, <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> had the second-highest anti-Reagan voting record among Republicans in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, as analyzed by <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> Quarterly magazine. He opposed the president on 71 percent of the key votes. `` When you get to the point where you start making decisions or doing things based upon political expedience, you've worn out your usefulness as someone who can really help,'' said <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, who says he makes his decisions on what's best for Vermonters, not on what's best for the Republicans. <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON> campaigns by saying that <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> should be honest and seek the Democratic nomination. `` My record will be more like <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>'s and not like <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s,'' says <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON>, a reference to <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s retiring Republican senator and the Democratic speaker of the House. <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> is considered the strong favorite in the November election, should he win the primary, because of his strong Democratic support. The Republican primary for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is one of three statewide contests that will be decided Tuesday. With <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> giving up his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat, four Democrats and two Republicans are seeking their respective party nominations. The two winners will be joined on the November ballot by <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, a socialist who is running a strong independent campaign for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat, and candidates representing the <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Libertarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the Small Is Beautiful Party. Former Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is favored to win the Republican congressional race, while the Democratic race, featuring former Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guest </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Poirier </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President Pro Tem <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON>, is considered wide open. Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON>, seeking her third term, is unopposed in Tuesday's primary, as is her Republican challenger, state Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON>.

 Big spending has become a big issue in Tuesday's heated Democratic primary battle for the seat held for 31 years by retiring Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, whose last re-election campaign cost him $ 145.10. <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> millionaire <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, running in his first election, stands accused of trying to buy the nomination by spending more than $ 2 million, much of it on TV advertising and much of it his own money. `` Politics should be people, ideas and leadership, not multimillion-dollar TV hype,'' said Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Follette </ORGANIZATION>, one of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s Democratic foes. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> is one of six states holding primary elections Tuesday. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, 53, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bucks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he had to buy the ads to win the name recognition enjoyed by <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Follette </PERSON>, former Gov. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON>, who was the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> nominee two years ago. `` I'm not looking to get ahead of the other -LRB- candidates -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. `` I just want to get to the point where we are even.'' On the Republican side, state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>, 36, and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. King, 47, former chairman of the state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, are running a more ideological race. He has labeled her a liberal and she has called him an ultra-conservative. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, who devoted nearly 32 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to fighting for budget cuts, said he was disappointed by the hefty spending in the race to replace him. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said he spent $ 145.10 in breezing to re-election in 1982. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, whose slogan is `` nobody's senator but yours,'' said he would not be obligated to special interest groups if elected because the money he spent was mainly his own. In his last campaign spending report, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said he spent nearly $ 2.1 million between his June 1 entry into the campaign and Aug. 24. He reported more than $ 1.5 million hand. `` We're spending way too much,'' <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> said. As of Aug. 24, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> had spent $ 431,719 and <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> $ 360,000. <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Follette </ORGANIZATION> reported expenditures of $ 15,536. <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> reported she spent $ 858,580 through Aug. 24, and King $ 342,907. One early Democratic candidate, Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, dropped out shortly after <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s entry. He said he could n't afford to compete with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. A recent poll commissioned by several TV stations showed <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> with 35 percent support and <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> with 33 percent among those who said they were likely to vote. <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> had 16 percent and <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Follette </ORGANIZATION> 6 percent. Nine percent were undecided. On the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> side, <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> led King 48 percent to 32 percent. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, 52, is a Madison attorney and former legislator who lost his 1986 bid for re-election as governor to Republican <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON>, 48, a lawyer and former executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Players </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, lost a close battle to unseat Republican Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in 1986. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Follette </PERSON>, 48, in his third term as secretary of state, was a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Parkside </ORGANIZATION> before his election to the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1972. He is a distant relative of the <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Follette </PERSON> family that produced several top <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> politicians, including two governors, and was an unsuccessful candidate for lieutenant governor in 1978. King, now a businessman, is a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who later served <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> when <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> headed President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s Watergate-tainted re-election campaign His major campaign fund-raiser featured <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a key figure in the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>, a 12-year veteran of the Legislature. Differences between her and <PERSON> King </PERSON> became personal when King brought up the subject of <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>'s two children, ages 1 and 4. `` If my family were young, if they were pre-schoolers, I would not be making this race,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> countered that nearly three out of four women work outside the home, and that under King's philosophy, neither <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> nor Republican Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Petri </PERSON> would have a place in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Here are highlights of the voting Tuesday: <LOCATION> ARIZONA </LOCATION> _ A large number of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> legislators who voted to impeach or convict ex-Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> earlier this year are being challenged by his ultra-conservative supporters. <LOCATION> MINNESOTA </LOCATION> _ Both GOP Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> and his likely Democratic opponent, state Attorney General <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, face minor opposition from within their parties. <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> HAMPSHIRE </LOCATION> _ Republican Rep. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> is favored to win the nomination for governor to succeed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who is retiring.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Buffalo graze nonchalantly near flaming trees, but people are not reacting so coolly, and residents once worried about losing business to forest fires now fear losing their homes. Fire has destroyed buildings around the Old Faithful geyser and has threatened tourist towns on the periphery of the country's first national park The <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> towns of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and Silver Gate outside the park's northeast entrance were evacuted twice last week. <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, near the northern gate, was evacuated Saturday. Firefighters saved <ORGANIZATION> Cooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> and Silver Gate, but only by burning thousands of acres of forest to remove fuel from the fire's path The so-called backfires left the once-picturesque towns flanked by black, skeletal trees. `` All we can do ... is herd it around improvements and structures _ and do n't get anybody killed,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martines </PERSON>, a structure protection officer in <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The 2.2 million-acre park, dedicated in 1872, attracts more than 2 million visitors a year who marvel at geysers and hot springs, mountain scenery and wild animals. But tourists have stayed away in droves this summer, and residents of tourism-dependent towns around the park have complained bitterly about the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s initial reluctance to respond to the fires. `` A guy gets really bitter when it keeps dragging on and on and on,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Klatt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, who spent spent three days in a motel room outside of town last week, waiting out an evacuation. In this summer of heat and drought, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> is suffering the worst fires in at least 200 years. Forest fires have charred more than 1 million acres in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and in the surrounding national forests and parks in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Each day, firefighters pray for rain, but at park headquarters near <LOCATION> Mammoth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> this is the third-driest summer on record. Only 1.6 inches of rain fell at Mammoth in June, July and August _ one-third the normal rainfall. It was also the hottest summer on record, with temperatures steaming an average of 5 degrees above normal, the weather service said. Though other areas are hard hit, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> is the top concern of federal officials. Of $ 250 million spent so far on fighting fires, $ 78 million has gone toward efforts around the park, said the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which coordinates firefighting in the West. Since 1972, park officials have allowed lightning-sparked fires to burn. `` In the past 16 years, we had 140 fires that burned 33,000 acres. That averages about 240 acres apiece before they went out on their own,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Varley </PERSON>, chief of the park's research division. The fires help cleanse the pine forest. They clear deadwood, create new meadows for forage, release nutrients for new plants and free the pines' seeds from their cones. A cool, wet spring lulled park officials into believing this summer would be no different. But the heat and low humidity left the forest more parched than kiln-dried lumber. By July 15, when the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> decided to start fighting the fires, it was too late to stop them. Fire crew boss <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Borton </PERSON> has battled forest fires in the West for 18 years, but the blaze he had been fighting and sleeping near for 25 nights was something new. `` This is the edge of a fire that goes back 50 miles,'' he said. `` It's as out of control as it was six weeks ago. This is the most extreme fire behavior that just about any of us has ever seen.''

<TEXT>
 Among the portraits of former <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> presidents hanging in the chamber, it's easy to pick out <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>. He's the one riding the horse. The Panhandle lawyer-rancher, who friends and foes alike call one of the most powerful men in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> government, exercises his authority `` exactly like the Godfather,'' a former colleague says. But that era is coming to an end. The 66-year-old, auburn-haired `` Red Barron'' was narrowly defeated in the Democratic primary on Tuesday. He lost to <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> lawyer born a year after <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> was first elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> 32 years ago. A conservative Democrat, <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> served as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president in 1975-76, once ordering then-Gov. <PERSON> Reubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Askew </PERSON> to stay out of the upper chamber, although in much more colorful words. Since then, he has served almost continuously as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, giving him control over the legislative calendar and make-or-break authority over bills. `` He's really one of a kind,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, historian and former clerk of the state House. `` I've been here since 1941 and really ca n't think of anybody who compares to him.'' His departure `` will reorganize the thinking in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. `` The senators no longer will have to puzzle over wat <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> thinks of each bill.'' In his successful primary challenge, <PERSON> Bruner </PERSON> cited <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>'s support of a tax increase and claimed <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> failed to pay attention to constituent needs and was too cozy to state business interests His challenge was aided by feminists angered that <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> helped kill the Equal Rights Amendment and by trial lawyers who opposed <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>'s efforts on behalf of insurance companies, many of them represented by his law firm, to limit the size of verdicts in negligence suits. `` He was the architect of the defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. `` Good riddance! I think we helped to dig his grave.'' As a result of <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>'s departure, some colleagues have been predicting a more partisan and open <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and reforms to reduce the virtually dictatorial power of the leadership. <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> exercised his power `` exactly like The Godfather,'' said former Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. `` His ability to do that was seductive, not in a sexual sense, but he had a truly seductive personality.'' The power was wielded with little regard to party labels and party loyalty. When unable to get his way in Democratic caucuses, he forged coalitions between conservatives in his own party, or `` Dempseycrats,'' and Republicans. He angered Democrat leaders by throwing his support to Republican candidates for national and statewide office, including <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> in his successful run for governor in 1986. Republicans did much of the mourning over his loss. `` I'm shocked, I'm sick,'' said <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a former state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman. `` We knew he was in a tight race,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, chief of operations for <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. `` But we all thought he would make it because he's <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>, he's the ` Red Barron,' and he's supposed to pull out.'' But the Democratic state chairman, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, had little sympathy. `` Sen. <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> lost the race when he and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> rode their horses together and put their arms around each other at the Bonifay Rodeo two years ago,'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. `` He alienated all the Democrats in the area by doing that. `` And it turns out <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> joined together to give us the biggest tax increase we ever had.'' <PERSON> Bruner </PERSON> had hammered <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>, usually a steadfast opponent of taxes _ any taxes _ for his support of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s ill-fated, $ 1 billion-a-year services tax. The tax was repealed in the wake of stiff opposition last year, but the governor and <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> wound up accepting an even bigger increase in the general sales tax. <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> said he has no regrets and plans to spend more time at his ranches in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. `` I'm a pretty private person and I'm going to live my life with my friends and move down the road,'' he said. `` My cattle are in good shape. I'm going to go up and cut hay. ... I've enjoyed the ride. Shed no tears for me.''

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Loan became the industry's biggest financial basket case by abandoning conservative ways, and some worry that a $ 2 billion federal bailout does n't do enough to force a return to conservatism As details of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s blueprint for reviving the nation's second-largest thrift trickle out, analysts, legislators and competitors are sounding calls for caution. Some fret over the planned transfer of American to the aggressive Bass investment group and suggestions that the revived company could be allowed to venture beyond the <ORGANIZATION> standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L business of home loans and savings accounts. Others recall what they see as regulatory inaction during the company's four-year slide toward receivership, a slide most blame on aggressive management, too-rapid growth and risky real estate loans. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, with headquarters in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION> and 186 branches throughout <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, was seized by the bank board Tuesday as a prelude to turning it over to the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Bass will pump $ 550 million cash into the insolvent thrift, and the bank board has committed $ 2 billion in cash and promissory notes over the next decade. American continues to operate; its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, announced plans to file a federal bankruptcy petition. American's problems pre-date the 1983 joining of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Loan and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Loan, the merger gave the company its present form. State, under Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, was known for making loans on commercial real estate ventures and developments spurned by other S & amp; Ls. American was a virtual opposite, with a large branch network and a portfolio of conservative home loans and savings accounts on which it paid relatively low interest. Regulators already keeping an eye on State believed that the merger, which created what was then the nation's biggest <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L, would stabilize <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>'s company. But American grew rapidly under <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, in part by making loans with fixed interest rates, a strategy that has come back to haunt <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> in periods of rising rates. In the summer of 1984, bank board analysts were warning that loans made by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and the old State Savings on real estate had been made without adequate analysis of the true value of the properties. Institutional investors were quietly withdrawing deposits amid a flurry of news reports about loan problems at American. A real depositor run began in 1984, after the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> forced American to restate its second-quarter results to account for losses on mortgage-backed securities, turning a $ 31 million profit into a $ 107 million loss. Losses from the run eventually were tallied at $ 6 billion. In August 1984, <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> was forced out by the bank board and replaced by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Popejoy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Popejoy </PERSON>, who had once been president of the old <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>, proceeded to cut costs, laying off 1,500 workers and selling 475 company cars and five jets. Management added to the company's reserve against bad loans, to the point where the reserve stood at more than $ 1.2 billion as of June 30. But after a period of shrinking American, <PERSON> Popejoy </PERSON> concluded the only way to save the company was to expand, adding branches and buying securities backed by mortgages with fixed interest rates. That's counter to an industry trend in recent years to issue mortgages with adjustable rates to protect the lender against rising interest rates. Competitors have pressed the bank board to rein in American, concerned that a big rescue would drive up their required payments to the industry's government-run insurance fund, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

And the bank board would have the right to step in to stop activities it deems too risky.

 Frantic growth and modernization rub shoulders with ancient tradition in a constant blur of old and new in this vibrant city, site of the 1988 Olympics. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, home to 10 million people, is the crown jewel in the economic miracle that turned <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> from one of the world's poorest nations into an economic powerhouse in just three decades The city also symbolizes how little some things have changed. Traditional ways of life exist alongside relentless expansion, and slums and poverty mix with prosperous suburbs and wealth. `` <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> is a city of contrasts. One moment you are facing the forefront of the 20th century and then you turn around and see a scene out of the Middle Ages,'' said one foreign resident. Gleaming skyscrapers and hordes of business workers in suits and dresses blanket the commercial districts. But just a few blocks away are tiny, dirty workshops where laborers work at a frantic pace for subsistence wages. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> is ringed with row after row of apartment buildings that house the growing middle classes. The city is also dotted with slums where up to 10 people live in a single room without plumbing. Dazzling new department stores in the center of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> show off the latest fashions and electronic goods. Families dress up to shop and eat hamburgers or pizza at Western restaurants and American fast-food chains. Just a few blocks away is ancient <ORGANIZATION> Namdaemun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> where stall holders hawk their goods to throngs of people packed into the narrow streets. Roadside vendors offer rice, dog meat, squid and other foods that have been staples for centuries. But modern values and habits appear to be prevailing. Nearly everyone dresses in Western clothing and some mothers complain that their children prefer hamburgers to rice. Divorce rates are climbing and dating has become commonplace. Families save to buy cars and appliances for increasingly Western lifestyles. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, devastated during the Korean War in the early 1950s and largely rebuilt, has few ancient or traditional Korean buildings. The pace in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> often is frantic. Workers routinely put in 10-hour shifts and work half days on Saturdays. Office workers stay at their desks to avoid being the first to leave at the end of the day. Children are inculcated with traditional Confucian values to revere their elders, obey orders and work hard. `` We want foreigners to see how much our country has attained. We are proud our country has done so well,'' said businessman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong-ik </PERSON>. But older Koreans say the younger generation is not so mindful of the need to work and take weeklong vacations and other unheard of indulgences. `` These young Koreans are very different. They want everything and do n't listen to their elders,'' said a senior journalist who spoke on condition of anonymity. Many things have been neglected in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to concentrate on expanding the economy as quickly as possible. Pollution has been allowed to go largely unchecked so business can flourish. The city has few parks or other recreational facilities. `` We need more time to become one of the developed countries. We are still developing,'' said businessman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. South Koreans hope the Olympics will cement its prosperity and modernization. They say there will be more time and money to fix problems that have been neglected. `` <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> can go worldwide through the Olympics,'' said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chul-yong </PERSON>, a shopkeeper. The Olympics are portrayed as a national mission, and ordinary people talk seriously about their duty to help ensure the Games are a success. The Olympics have spread into almost every aspect of life. The symbol of the Olympic movement _ five interlocked circles _ is stamped on everything from milk cartons and television logos to each <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> subway car. `` The No. 1 Games. The No. 1 people,'' proclaim the subway signs.

<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> is tough and highly disciplined despite his modest demeanor, qualities he will need to govern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for the next six years. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, 40, faces protracted economic problems that affect <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a vocal opposition that still questions whether his mandate was won fairly. `` Given the circumstances, he is going to have to be a great president because otherwise the problems of the country will become enormously complicated,'' said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON>, a close colleague and general secretary of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. An illustration of one lingering problem was the vote Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> to certify <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' July 6 election as president. Virtually all votes came from the governing party, called the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> for its Spanish initials. The opposition, which held the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> to 50.7 percent of the official vote _ the lowest since <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> took power in 1929, maintains the presidency was won by fraud. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> was the chief architect of an economic austerity program that rescued this nation of 85 million people from near bankruptcy and has cut its record 159 percent inflation for 1987 by half this year. Still, his policies remain unpopular because workers have lost half their buying power. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> share a 2,000-mile border, and bilateral issues include <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s $ 104 billion debt, drug trafficking and immigration. If <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s economy gets worse, many Mexicans are likely to vote with their feet by moving north. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> also will have to deal with a party that is struggling to adapt to a more democratic environment. Many of his ideas for decentralizing the economy and reduce the role of the state are unpopular with politicians used to wielding unquestioned power. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, like his three predecessors, rose in the bureaucracy and has no previous experience in elective office, although he grew up with politics. His father was a former commerce minister, his mother an economist active in party politics. Born in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> lived in the village of <LOCATION> Tetla </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> while researching his doctoral thesis on the connection between government spending and political power. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> holds two master's degrees and one doctorate from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where his father also attended. He speaks fluent English. After graduation, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> advanced quickly in government, catching the eye of <ORGANIZATION> Miguel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> and becoming budget secretary when <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> became president in 1982. `` He's very comprehensive, in the sense that he seems to have a computer in his head'' to manage many problems at once, said <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Granados </PERSON>, information secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>. Another associate said <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> `` likes to be informed on everything'' and as president may have to learn to `` let go of things more.'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has had to fight the image that he is a technocrat without political experience. His public comments are unrevealing, he lacks charisma and is often depicted in local cartoons as a mouse because of his baldness, big ears and mustache. But associates say he is forceful and demanding, requiring work be done well and promptly. `` When he proposes something, he attains it,'' said one associate, noting that <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> decided to learn tennis about three years ago and has since become a good amateur player. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, who won a silver medal in an equestrian event at the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Games </ORGANIZATION> in 1971, also runs three or four times a week. He married <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Occelli </PERSON> after a seven-year engagement that began while they were students. `` He was very serious, but at the same time jovial,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said this year. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> does n't smoke, drinks only socially and spends any free time with his wife and their three children, associates said.

 Firefighters took advantage of chilly, damp weather Monday to strengthen lines around fires that have ravaged nearly 1 million acres inside the park, but hot, dry weather was predicted by midweek. `` It's a sleeping giant now,'' <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON>, a fire incident commander, said during a briefing Monday. `` We want to tie it down so when it wakes up it ca n't run on us.'' Fire activity was limited Monday after a weekend of showers and light snow _ the first significant precipitation since spring _ that gave firefighters a needed break from high wind and temperatures that let fires grow by thousands of acres per day last week. The fires inside the 2.2-million-acre park had burned 939,270 acres as of Monday. Temperatures remained in the 40s in the park Monday, keeping humidity levels at up to 50 percent, but the weather was expected to begin clearing Tuesday and temperatures were to reach 70 degrees by Wednesday, drying the area once again. The cool, wet weekend also helped firefighters in surrounding areas of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where a 15,700-acre fire was declared under control Monday. `` We're more optimistic this morning than we have been for some weeks,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Baden </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> director at the <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` With the moisture we have on the fires now it's cooled them down to where we can in and work them directly.'' The center, which coordinates forest fire suppression, calls this the worst forest fire season in 30 years. Forests and brush also burned in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where a 400-acre fire that apparently began from an illegal campfire in an alpine area of Olympic National Park had crews from three states fighting it. And a fire in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Gold Rush country in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> forced most of the 4,500 residents of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wildwood </LOCATION> to evacuate for a second time Monday. In <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, a fast-moving fire broke out in dry grass and timber in the <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and sheriff's deputies warned residents about six miles southeast of <LOCATION> Oakridge </LOCATION> to be ready to evacuate. The fire quickly burned 1,000 acres in rolling hills 10 to 15 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Oakridge </LOCATION>, forest spokeswoman <PERSON> Lorette </PERSON> <PERSON> Laferriere </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baden </PERSON> said there 28 fires still out of control in the West that had charred 1.8 million acres. The favorable weather allowed <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> officials to open all roads through the park Monday except its northeastern entrance leading to <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, the route inside the park from <LOCATION> Mammoth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> to Canyon and Tower, and <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Pass </PERSON>. About 1,000 Marines from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, were to reach <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday and Thursday to help firefighters, while some of the first soldiers sent to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, were not to be released until at least Saturday. `` We'll have lots of people here, so maybe we can nail this thing,'' <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> said. Although moisture helped slow the advance of the flames, with little growth recorded during the weekend, it would probably dry out quickly, <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> said. He added, however, none of the fires would make major progress until the area is thoroughly dried. `` We'd have to have a heck of a lot of rain to put the fire out,'' said fire information officer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> on the 31,500-acre Red Bench fire at Glacier National Park in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. `` You're talking numbers of inches of rain. Despite the return of warmer weather, the arrival of autumn weather with lower temperatures and shorter days had officials optimistic the fires would no longer make major advances. `` We still expect fire activity, but it wo n't be as intense or as much or as fast as it has been in the past,'' said fire information officer <PERSON> Sonya </PERSON> <PERSON> Capek </PERSON>. `` The days are getting shorter, so the burning period is getting shorter.'' North of the park in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> canceled his sweeping ban on all recreational activities in the state's fire-ravaged countryside because of the weekend weather About 1,000 firefighters got the day off Monday in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> because up to a foot of snow fell on the eastern half of the 247,000-acre <LOCATION> Cnyon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire north of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, said fire information officer <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>. They were taken to a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> facility to warm up and dry out their clothes. More than 100 residents evacuated from scattered homes, cabins and ranches along the fire's eastern front were returning to the region by Sunday and Monday, she added. Also in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Hellroaring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire that had charred 81,900 acres and moved into <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> was contained Sunday, said information officer <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Comstock </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyslovsky </PERSON>, an anti-communist former Russian general whose World War II unit fought with <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s troops against the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, has died at age 91 Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Smyslovsky </PERSON>, who then called himself <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmston </PERSON>, led a 6,000-man contingent known as the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Russian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> of the German Wehrmacht. At the end of World War II, he and 500 remaining soldiers managed to reach neutral <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION>, where staunchly anti-communist Prince <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> granted them political asylum. Death notices published in <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION> newspapers said he died in the capital <LOCATION> Vaduz </LOCATION> last Monday and was buried Thursday. The mass-circulation Swiss newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sonntagsblick </ORGANIZATION> reported his death Sunday. Once an officer in the Russian Imperial Guards, <PERSON> Smyslosvky </PERSON> went into Polish and German exile after fighting the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION> in the civil war. After <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> invaded <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> in 1941, he became the first Russian to command a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> unit fighting for the Germans on the eastern front. In a 1985 interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, he said his goal was to end communism in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and get rid of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. But he said he was not a Nazi. `` I thought that the Germans would be the only ones who could defeat the Soviets and that the Allies then would defeat the exhausted Germans,'' he said. `` What the Germans did was horrible. <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> corrupted their souls,'' he said. `` But the Soviets destroyed a whole nation, <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Smyslovsky </PERSON> said volunteers from among Soviet prisoners of war formed the bulk of his army, with the rest made up of prewar exiles like himself. When the eastern front collapsed, the unit fled westward and was decimated by fighting. But <PERSON> Smyslovsky </PERSON> and his men, still heavily armed, marched through <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and crossed into <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION> on May 3, 1945. Among them was <PERSON> Grand </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Cyrillovich </PERSON>, heir to the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> throne, whom the soldiers had picked up in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The group encountered no resistance from <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> border patrols guarding the tiny principality between <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, which dissolved its army in 1868. The Russians were disarmed and granted political asylum. A Soviet repatriation commission later interviewed <PERSON> Smyslovsky </PERSON>'s men, and almost half of them agreed to return `` We have never heard from them again,'' <PERSON> Smyslovsky </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the rest went into exile in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, including <PERSON> Smyslovsky </PERSON>. But in 1975, he returned to <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION> with his wife <PERSON> Irene </PERSON>, who survives him.

 Six men firing submachine guns killed a British executive in an ambush about 12 miles southwest of this <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island city, police said Sunday. Investigator <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuertes </PERSON> said the victim, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tree </PERSON>, 56, was aboard a service vehicle that left a cocoa plantation when six gunmen opened fire about noon Saturday. Tree died instantly. His Filipino driver suffered only slight injuries, <PERSON> Fuertes </PERSON> said. Tree was vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Malaysian-Filipino firm. Police initially reported the firm was Swiss-American. Communist rebels near <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> have threatened attacks on American interests. But no such warning has been issued to British businessmen. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Calida </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> area police commander, said by telephone that the gunmen may have intended to kill the Filipino plantation manager for <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION>. The Filipino manager had refused demands to pay `` revolutionary taxes'' to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and had been receiving death threats, <PERSON> Calida </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Calida </PERSON> added that the manager, <PERSON> Dioniso </PERSON> <PERSON> Capusan </PERSON>, was supposed to have driven down the same road at the time of the noon attack. <PERSON> Calida </PERSON> said he did not know if Tree had received similar threats. Supporters of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> meanwhile celebrated the ousted president's 71st birthday Sunday with a rally in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and a giant birthday cake in <LOCATION> Laoag </LOCATION>, a northern provincial capital about 250 miles to the north. About 5,000 <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters cheered under a light rain as <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' niece, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocka </PERSON>, blew out the largest of 71 candles on the 30-feet-by-75-feet cake, baked by dozens of volunteers. `` I thank you for having made by brother's birthday as great as this,'' said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' sister, <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON> <PERSON> Barba </PERSON>, as she was presented the first piece. Organizers of the cake project hoped about 24,000 people would turn out for the celebration, but police estimated the crowd at about 5,000. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, about 3,000 <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters marked their leader's birthday with fireworks and a rally in a downtown square, where speakers denounced President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who toppled <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> during a popular uprising in February 1986 <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> greeted his supporters in a telephone interview broadcast over <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> DZEC </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where he fled after the uprising. `` By the grace of the Almighty, we are still alive and it is my hope that I can go back there, I can come back to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> told his followers. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return, citing national security. But the ousted president has asked the anti-corruption court to order his return to defend himself during a court hearing set for November. A decision by the court is pending.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have issued matching promises of accessibility to the White House press, but neither was saying how often he would hold formal presidential news conferences. The rival presidential nominees made their statements on news and information policies in written responses to inquiries by the <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Managing Editors Association. Their replies were made public as <ORGANIZATION> APME </ORGANIZATION> officers and committee chairmen met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Monday. `` I hope words like ` accessible,' ` candid,' ` honest' and ` fair' will be adjectives used to describe my relationship with the media by historians,'' Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` It certainly is what I will strive for during my tenure as president.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has come under frequent criticism for limiting access to information. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> renewed that criticism. The Democratic nominee prefaced his comments on his plans with a charge that `` the Reagan-Bush administration has waged an assault on the Freedom of Information Act with every weapon in its arsenal.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he has a proven record of accessibility to reporters, and would continue on that course as president. `` Throughout my public career I've believed in a free press and my record shows I've practiced that belief,'' he said. `` As president, I would hope to continue this pattern of accessibility to the White House press corps, giving them and me the opportunity to utilize our First Amendment freedoms. A questionnaire prepared for the FOI committee was given to both candidates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded directly, answering each of the questions. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> replied by issuing a two-part position paper, with one section on the freedom of information law and a second on his press relations. Here is a partial transcript of their replies:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GEORGE BUSH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Q. As president, what sort of tone would you set regarding openness in government, access to government information and freedom of information? A. Within the limits of national security, government should be open to scrutiny by the media and the public. Ours is a democracy where goverment must be accountable to the people. The information-gathering process, from a news conference to the Freedom of Information Act, is vital and essential to our system of democracy. Q. What kind of relationship do you think you've had with the media during your public career? How would you seek to improve it, if at all? A. I think I have had a good relationship with the media. As president, I hope that I will be able to spend more time talking with smaller groups of reporters. I enjoy a good give and take, and that kind of format allows me to get to know reporters a little better and them to know me. Not only will this benefit reporters but, more importantly, such free exchange will ultimately benefit the general public as well. Q. Throughout history, presidents have had a variety of relationships with the media. Are there any styles you would emulate? Are there any you would avoid? When it comes time to write the history of your relations with the media, what will it say? A. With the media, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the public, it would be a mistake to attempt to be something or someone you're not. So, warts and all, what you see is what you'll get. I hope words like `` accessible,'' `` candid,'' `` honest'' and `` fair'' will be adjectives used to describe my relationship with the media by historians. It certainly is what I will strive for during my tenure as president. ... Q. How frequently would you meet with reporters? How would you conduct press conferences? How often would you hold press conferences? Would you make any changes in the way President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has done his press conferences? A. There are a number of ways to communicate with both the media and the public. Press conferences are one important way and they would certainly be central to my effort to ensure accessibility in my administration. One-on-one and group interviews, satellite interviews with regional media, national televised addresses are other examples of methods that a president can and should use to provide the media with opportunities to discuss administration policies and programs. My goal would be to get the right `` mix'' of all of the options available to guarantee an open administration. Realistically, you ca n't put a number on any of the working parts of an open approach to accessibility, but you can make and keep a commitment to the goal itself. Q. More specifically, what message will you send to your executive agencies regarding Freedom of Information requests? A. My message will be simple: obey the law. ... Q. Here's a chance to offer some contructive criticism. What things would you most like to change about the news media? What should the nation's media do differently to better serve the public interest? A. Accuracy and fairness are the name of the game. The media goes to great lengths to be accurate. It needs to go to the same lengths to be fair. While it is often necessary to use unnamed sources in gathering information for a story, it puts the validity of a story at a disadvantage. I hope the news media would rely as little as possible on this approach to information gathering and reporting.

 Q. What sort of individual do you see putting in the job of White House spokesperson? How much access would the spokesman have to administration thinking and information? Do you condone <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' practice of manufacturing quotes? A. The job of White House press secretary is one of the toughest in any administration and a number of qualities are important. A press secretary must be honest, ethical, steady, candid with both the media and the president and experienced, with an understanding of the media and its needs. A sense of humor does n't hurt either. If access is important to reporters, it is absolutely vital to a press secretary. ... I understand that to function effectively a press secretary must have a first-hand knowledge of a President's policies and positions ... Finally, on the third question: no. Q. How much access do you believe reporters ought to have to the White House staff? How free would your staff be to talk on the record to reporters? A. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Administration will be an open one. That does n't mean every staff member will be authorized to serve as an administration spokesman or interpreter of events and policies The best interests of the government, media and public are n't observed by the confusion and misinformation that usually results from that kind of policy. Not in every instance but in most, if something ca n't be said on the record, it's probably better left unsaid. ... Q. What would be your policy on allowing media coverage of military actions -LRB- a la <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> -RRB-? Do you support the pool approach worked out and used in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> exercises, or do you believe reporters and photographers ought to have even freer access to military operations? A. Certainly, the public has a right to know the details of military operations in an appropriate time frame and in a way that does not risk national security. The current relationship between the military and the press is workable and I support it. But that safety of the troops and the success of the mission must be paramount, and I will risk neither.

 Freedom of Information: For the past eight years, the Reagan-Bush administration has waged an assault on the Freedom of Information Act -LRB- FOIA -RRB- with every weapon in its arsenal _ executive orders, budget cuts, fee guidelines and legislative proposals. Their objective is clear: to gut a statute whose fundamental premise is that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens have the right to know about the activities of their own government. The current administration claims that complying with the <ORGANIZATION> FOIA </ORGANIZATION> is too time-consuming, too expensive and too bothersome. These are excuses for government secrecy. And they could serve as a cloak for incompetence, mismanagement, illegality or corruption. ... As president, I will implement the <ORGANIZATION> FOIA </ORGANIZATION> in the spirit which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended. From <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to Watergate to Iran-Contra, we Americans have learned what happens when government operates in secrecy, accountable to no one. A <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration will treat requesters of information as clients, not as burdens. For only in an atmosphere of the fullest possible disclosure can the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people retain confidence in their government. Relations with the press: Throughout my public career I've believed in a free press and my record shows I've practiced that belief As governor for nearly 10 years, I have been accessible to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> reporters several times a week. I enjoy the spirited give and take of news conferences and the vigorous exchange of an interview. More important, I understand and appreciate the role of the news media in a free society as laid out two centuries ago in the Bill of Rights to the Constitution. As president, I would hope to continue this pattern of accessibility to the White House press corps, giving them and me the opportunity to utilize our First Amendment freedoms.

<HEAD>Shatt-al-Arab Historical Source Of Friction For Iran, Iraq</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dispute between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> over sovereignty of the palm-fringed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which threatens to snarl their peace talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, dates back more than 400 years. Although <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic Revolution was the catalyst for the 8-year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, the battle for control of the 125-mile-long waterway was also one of the major causes. Over the last four centuries, the waterway has figured in at least 25 wars. The Shatt, the traditional southern boundary between the two ancient antagonists, is also the historical racial and religious divide between the Arabs in the west and the Persians in the east They even call it by different names. To the Arabs, it's the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION>, or River of The Arabs, the name used on most maps. To the Iranians, it's the Arvand Rud, or river. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claims a 1975 agreement that put the border down the middle of the waterway is null and void. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which gained most from the treaty, insists it is still valid. Apart from its political significance, the waterway, formed by the confluence of the Euphrates and <LOCATION> Tigris </LOCATION> rivers, is also economically important to both countries, particularly <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The Shatt is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the gulf. West of the Shatt's estuary, it only has 10 miles of coastline Its major port of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, heavily damaged during the war and closed since the start of the conflict, depends for its existence on the Shatt. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has a 1,400-mile coastline, running all the way down the gulf to the Arabian Sea. But it needs the Shatt for its oil export route from <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION>. Its big port of <LOCATION> Khorammshahr </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION>, also lies on the waterway, as does the Iranian naval base at <LOCATION> Khosrowabad </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> oil terminal, through which 90 percent of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s oil exports passes, lies only 30 miles south of the Shatt estuary. The economic importance of the waterway for <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> diminished during the war, when the Iranians boosted trade and oil exports through other gulf ports and installations. The sovereignty dispute has spawned at least 20 often ambigious treaties since 1847 that did little to settle it. <LOCATION> Lord </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palmerston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s prime minister from 1855 to 1865, considered the problem was so complex that only the superpowers of the day, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, could solve it by arbitrarily imposing a settlement. The earliest specific boundary agreement to have a historical validity was the Treaty of Erzerum, signed in 1847, which gave control of the Shatt to the Ottomans. The British and Russians helped arrange another border pact in <LOCATION> Constantinople </LOCATION> in 1913, which upheld the principle of freedom of navigation by all nations, but drew the boundary down the eastern, Iranian bank. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which emerged from the breakup of the Ottoman Empire in 1918, based its subsequent claims of sovereignty on that 1913 accord. The Iranians, moving into the modern age under <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, flexed their muscles by disputing the status quo. They rejected the 1847 treaty and demanded that the boundary lay down the middle of the waterway. A 1937 treaty confirmed Iraqi sovereignty. Although the Iranians got some territorial concessions, the treaty rankled them for the next three decades. In 1960, the Iranians appointed their own river pilots. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> retaliated by forcing the closure of <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION>, by then a vital oil outlet. But in 1969, as the shah built up <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s navy in his drive to make <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> the dominant power in the gulf, he abrogated the 1937 treaty and sent his gunboats into the waterway. He also backed Kurdish separatists in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in their war against <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> for an autonomous homeland. The rebellion seriously weakened the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government and in March 1975, then-vice president <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> was forced to sign the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> Treaty in 1975 with the shah. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> conceded the border ran down the deep-water channel in the middle of the Shatt. In return, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> cut off aid to the Kurds. <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> considered the loss of Iraqi sovereignty over the Shatt a humiliation. On Sept, 17, 1980, amid border skirmishes with the new fundamentalist regime in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>, by then <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s president, ripped up the treaty. Five days later he invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 Protesters stoned the motorcade of President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> Sunday during a campaign tour on the 15th anniversary of the military coup he led that ousted the government of Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>. In the coastal resort of <PERSON> Vina </PERSON> del Mar, thousands of leftists battled riot police following a memorial service at the grave of Allende, who perished in the coup. Witnesses said at four protesters suffered bullet wounds when <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s bodyguards opened fire after the president's motorcade was stoned in <LOCATION> Cerro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Navia </LOCATION>, a working-class suburb north of <LOCATION> Santiato </LOCATION>. Police did not report any injuries or arrests in <LOCATION> Cerro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Navia </LOCATION> but said 142 people were arrested in <PERSON> Vina </PERSON> del Mar when militants tried to march from the cemetery into the city center. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the only candidate in next month's presidential referendum, was booed by hundreds of people when he arrived in <LOCATION> Cerro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Navia </LOCATION>. Many hurled rocks at his motorcade, according to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperativa </ORGANIZATION>. The broadcast said <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s bodyguards fired shots into the air and vehicles in the motorcade drove around barricades of burning tires. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperativa </ORGANIZATION> said no one was seriously hurt but some people were hit by rocks and had minor injuries. Reporters at the scene said four people were struck by bullets and two, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Orieta </PERSON> <PERSON> Valvez </PERSON>, were in serious condition with stomach wounds. Earlier Sunday, in a speech marking the Sept. 11,1973, overthrow of Allende, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> addressed an audience of 3,000 people in a government office building. Among those present were <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s fellow armed forces commanders and the 16-member Cabinet `` We will triumph in the upcoming challenge,'' the 72-year-old president said. Outside, thousands of supporters rallied noisily on the street. They waved red, white and blue Chilean flags and banners promoting a `` Yes'' vote in the referendum. An estimated 5,000 people attended the memorial service for Allende in <LOCATION> Vina </LOCATION> del Mar, 75 northwest of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. After the service, thousands of leftists began a march from the suburban cemetery to the downtown area and were blocked by helmeted riot police. Fighting broke out about five blocks from the cemetery and police used tear gas, clubs and water cannon to disperse the demonstrators but running street battles continued for nearly three hours. Reporters said several people were arrested and some demonstrators were injured but no figures were given by police. In his speech, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> indicated the estimated 300 foreign observers expected to observe the presidential plebiscite might get a cool reception. `` We forcefully repudiate those foreigners who try to intervene in our internal affairs,'' he said. `` In the plebiscite, we will give the world a new lesson in democracy,'' he said. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, in military uniform with the presidential sash across his chest, spoke in his yearly state-of-the-nation address on the anniversary of the coup. `` I am ready to give the last breath of life to my country,'' he said. If the voters approve the referendum <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will remain as president until 1997. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> boasted of social and economic achievements by his administration but added: `` Despite the spectacular advances achieved, there's much left to do.'' In a bid for votes, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> announced special bonuses for public employees and retirees. No details were given. The Retirees' Party, an association of pensioners opposed to <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, called the bonus offer a scheme for votes. `` You ca n't buy consciences with money,'' said the party's president, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> Shortly before the president arrived at the government building for his speech, police bomb experts were summoned to deactivate a device from a car authorities said contained 155 pounds of explosives. The car was parked across the street from the main entrance to the building. An anonymous caller told a foreign news agency by telephone the car contained explosives. He did not identify himself as belonging to any particular group. A police communique said: `` The explosion would have caused numerous deaths and injuries among the multitude awaiting the president's arrival.'' In the Oct. 5 vote, Chileans will decide if <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will receive an eight-year term in March. If a majority rejects the proposal open elections will be held in one year and <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will hand power over to the winner in 1990. Win or lose, congressional elections will be held in 1990 for the first time since the legislature was disbanded aftert the coup. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be virtually powerless to amend a 1980 Constitution that gives the military autonomy and a powerful supervisory role in national affairs. In his 55-minute speech, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said his new government would be democratic while providing safeguards against international Marxism, which he said had subjected the country to `` a constant and indiscriminate agression.'' The government has said it will not recognize foreigners who come to observe the vote. A group of ex-congressmen opposed to <ORGANIZATION> Pinochet </ORGANIZATION> has said it expects at least 300 foreigners, many of them officials in their countries, to come as observers.

<HEAD>Textile Forces Fight Mopping Up Action on Import Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> supporters of the textile and apparel industries are going into this week determined to break their opponents' grip on import restraint legislation and send the bill to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> once and for all. `` Business is business,'' Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, declared Friday as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill 57-32. `` Business is not fair. It's no use crying and moaning about fairness. We've got to do something. The bill, designed to limit foreign competition to selected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries, would freeze this year's textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels and limit growth to 1 percent annually from then on. Imports of nonrubber footwear would be capped at 1987 levels with no increases in market share for foreign manufacturers allowed. Supporters say it would save American jobs while critics counter that it would raise prices, narrow consumer choices and throw a wrench into the gears of international trade. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also plans action this week on the drug issue, including debate on proposals to fine users $ 10,000 and prod states to cancel their driver's licenses. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, must decide what to do with a $ 140 billion social programs spending bill that has become snarled in the abortion issue. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is vowing an all-out effort to block the textile bill, even if it means an election-eve battle to sustain a presidential veto. Opponents of the bill managed to keep it bottled up in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> over the weekend, even though it already has won approval. A second vote is needed to send the measure to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which already has passed a similar bill and must now vote upon <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> changes in the legislation. The opponents threatened to filibuster the second vote and it appeared that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would not be able to wash its hands of the bill until Tuesday or even later. But there is no question that supporters will eventually get the bill to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and this week's dispute mainly represents a mopping up action. The drug bill before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would add another $ 2 billion on top of the $ 3.9 billion now being spent annually by the federal government on anti-drug efforts. In addition to debating whether to penalize drug users, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will try to decide whether to keep in the bill a seven-day waiting period for handgun purchasers. An amendment being offered by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., would drop the waiting period in favor of a voluntary system under which dealers could check by phone or other means on whether a would-be gun buyer had ever been convicted of a felony The drug bill appears headed for a vote Thursday or Friday. Those favoring a harsh crackdown succeeded last week in attaching provisions calling for a federal death penalty, no government benefits for twice-convicted users and court use of evidence seized illegally if police obtained it while acting `` in good faith.'' This week, Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., will propose civil penalties of up to $ 10,000 per violation against those possessing even small `` personal use'' amounts of marijuana, cocaine, and other drugs Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., is pushing a proposal to provide up to $ 125 million over three years to states that order drivers license suspensions or revocations for convicted drug users <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON> has a variant that would dock states some of their federal highway money unless they adopted the penalty. Senators passed the social spending bill with an expansion of the Medicaid program to cover abortions for rape and incest victims. But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Friday refused to accept that provision in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, Education, and <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> spending bill. The House this week also is expected to pass an insider trading bill that, for the first time, would clear the way for fining securities firms for violations committed by their employees. Maximum jail terms for insider trading would be increased from five to 10 years, and maximum criminal fines would go from $ 500,00 to $ 2.5 million per violation for companies; and from $ 100,000 to $ 1 million for individuals. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plans a vote Wednesday on a bill that would impose harsh sanctions on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Similar to a House-passed bill, it would end virtually all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and trade with that country because of its apartheid policy of racial segregation. But prospects for the measure on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor appear dim, with only a few weeks remaining before adjournment.

<HEAD>Colleges Losing Interest in Humanities, But The Public's Not</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Colleges and universities are losing interest in literature, language and history but Americans are showing a `` remarkable blossoming'' of interest in cultural events, spending more money on them than on sports events, a government report says. The report by <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION>, says the high cost of education may be causing more students to avoid liberal arts subjects in favor of courses that will give them a money-making career. While the number of bachelor's degrees awarded increased 88 percent in the past two decades, degrees in the humanities dropped 33 percent, said her report released Sunday. Foreign language majors were down 29 percent, English majors 33 percent, philosophy majors 35 percent and history majors 43 percent, it said. The 73-page report ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> says too many colleges are neglecting the achievements of Western culture while requiring ethnic courses, treating literary masterpieces as political documents, stressing publishing rather than teaching, and dealing in topics so specialized that they have little meaning outside the academic world. The report says museums, libraries, educational TV stations, state humanities councils and private historical societies provide so much education that they have become `` a kind of parallel school,'' reaching millions of people outside college campuses. `` The remarkable blossoming of the humanities in the public sphere is one of the least noted, though most important, cultural developments of the last few decades,'' writes Mrs. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. The $ 140 million endowment she has headed since May 1986 provides grants to scholars, colleges, museums, libraries and other institutions to promote the humanities. Citing a variety of sources, the report gives several examples of increased public interest in the humanities, including record high book sales, a doubling of the number of historical organizations in 20 years to nearly 10,000, and a 660 percent increase in visitors to the National Gallery of Art in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since 1957. Americans who spent twice as much on sports events as on cultural endeavors 20 years ago are now spending more on culture _ $ 3.4 billion compared with $ 3.1 billion for sports in 1986, said a news release accompanying the report. It gave no details on how the figures were obtained or what cultural events were included. The report says that while some have argued that television is the enemy of books, people are actually both watching television and reading, with book sales up 400 percent since television was rare 40 years ago. Mrs. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> credits television with increasing the sale of some books which have been the basis for popular dramas or subjects of discussion on educational television shows. In assessing the academic approach to the humanities, the report says: `` Viewing humanities texts as though they were primarily political documents is the most noticeable trend in academic study of the humanities today. Truth and beauty and excellence are regarded as irrelevant; questions of intellectual aesthetic quality, dismissed.'' The report says Western tradition is rich and creative, but many colleges are abandoning courses that teach it. The report says a course in great Western literature is under attack at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holyoke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> require ethnic or Third World courses but have no Western civilization requirements. `` The humanities are about more than politics, about more than social power,'' the report says. `` What gives them their abiding worth are truths that pass beyond time and circumstance; truths that, transcending accidents of class, race, and gender, speak to us all.'' The report, `` Humanities in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' resulted from several meetings of advisory panels and regional groups formed by the endowment. It follows a 1986 report, `` American Memory,'' which detailed how little high school students know about Western history, literature and culture.

<HEAD>Campaign '88: Bush, Dukakis Take Opposite Stands on Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When it comes to abortion, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> agree on one thing: each man says he personally does not favor the controversial procedure. But beyond their personal feelings, the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees have staked out opposite stands on whether abortion should be legal and whether the government should pay for the operation for poor women. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favors a constitutional amendment to overturn the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision, <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, that legalized abortion. He favors outlawing all abortions except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. He opposes Medicaid funding of abortions for poor women except to save the woman's life. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as a legislator and governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, has been a resolute supporter of women's legal right to choose abortion, as well as government-funding of the operation for the poor. Anti-abortion pickets are a common sight at rallies for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, just as they hounded the Democrats' ticket of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> and <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> in 1984. Prior to becoming <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s running mate in 1980, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposed a constitutional amendment to overturn legalized abortion. He once supported federal funding of abortions in cases of rape or incest, as well as to save the mother's life. Asked in 1984 why he changed his position, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` There has been _ I have to make a confession _ an evolution in my position. There's been 15 million abortions since 1973, and I do n't take that lightly. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has altered his stand on the issue, others in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> remain pro-choice, including the vice president's campaign co-chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill Recently, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his opposition to abortion is not a stand that he expects everyone in his party has to share. Questioned about <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s position during a campaign stop in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> on Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I have a lot of key supporters who agree with <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> and a lot that agree with me.'' He added: `` Who's going to have a litmus test that everybody has to agree with everybody on every single issue? Asked about the hardline stand against abortion in the Republican platform, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` The platform states the position of the platform but nobody in our party takes a litmus test that says that everybody has to agree on every issue. I expect the Democrats could say the same thing.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been called `` a pro-abortion zealot'' by Dr. <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willke </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The group's legislative director, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, said, `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he's personally opposed, but he wants to subsidize it on demand.'' He pointed to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' sponsoring of a bill in 1970 to legalize abortion in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and later, as governor, his vetoes of several bills with restrictions on abortion funding. Facing a strident anti-abortion protest in a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb Tuesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` While I do n't favor abortion or think it's a good thing, I happen to think that in the last analysis it's up to the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, to make that decision. `` We should not brand women as criminals for making that decision. I think that's what most Americans believe, and it's certainly what the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has held,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Aug. 18, said, `` Is it right to believe in the sanctity of life and protect the lives of innocent children? My opponent says no _ but I say yes. ... We've got to change from abortion to adoption.'' <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` There is a stark, stark difference between the two candidates'' and between the two parties' platforms on abortion. The Democrats' terse platform, without mentioning the word abortion, says, `` the right of reproductive choice should be guaranteed regardless of ability to pay.'' The GOP platform contains anti-abortion language in several sections, including a plank that declares: `` the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which can not be infringed.'' It endorses both a human life amendment and legislation to extend the 14th Amendment's protections to the unborn. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has said he, too, personally opposes abortion and does not favor federal funding except in cases of rape, incest or to save the mother's life. But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> both agree that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has usually voted against restrictions on abortion funding and against constitutional amendments to ban abortion. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was absent July 27 when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 73-19 to allow Medicaid funding of abortions in promptly reported cases of rape or incest. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, on a 216-166 vote Friday, refused to go along with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> move, which would be the first liberalization of Medicaid abortion funding in seven years. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> may take up the issue early this week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, voted with that <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority July 27. But <ORGANIZATION> NARAL </ORGANIZATION> says he was among `` many anti-choice senators'' who voted for the amendment only as an alternative to accepting even fewer restrictions on Medicaid funding. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is rated highly by the anti-abortion groups and lowly by <ORGANIZATION> NARAL </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says he generally opposes abortion except to save the mother's life. Activists on both sides agree the next president is likely to make several appointments to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that could sway the tribunal's ruling on abortion. The current court has four justices who generally support the 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision, four who have been critical of it and one _ the newest member, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> _ whose views are not yet clear. `` My biggest concern is the next president's role in appointing at least three <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices, if not more,'' said <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, whose organization helped defeat President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nomination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> had criticized <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, `` On Inauguration Day next January, there'll be three pro-abortion justices over 80 years of age.'' A human life amendment is `` a long ways down the road,'' he said, but if the Democrats capture the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could appoint a pro-abortion majority for years to come.''

<HEAD>Drought-related River Traffic Losses Pegged at $200 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A preliminary review by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of this summer's barge traffic on drought-reduced rivers shows some of the huge problems that have plagued the movement of grain from inland farm points into export shipping channels. In mid-June, low water levels on the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> rivers began to stall barges at choke points for more than a day. By the end of the month stoppages were a regular occurrence. `` Reduced load size, smaller tows and lengthened transit times have dropped the capacity of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> system by at least 50 percent,'' the report said. `` Difficult navigation and increased travel time add to costs, especially for fuel and labor which normally account for about 35 percent of total operating costs.'' Overall, according to a recent industry study, barge operators could lose as much as $ 200 million this year. The smaller river flow forced gyrations in barge rates, the report said. Even before the drought's full effect, rates were going higher because of greater demand. In the first five months, they averaged nearly a fourth more than in the same January-May period of 1987. In the first two weeks of June, barge rates jumped 4 percent from the end of May. By the end of June, rates had nearly tripled. `` This increase was short-lived,'' the report said. `` In the first week of July, rates fell to about 125 percent above the end of May, and by month's end had returned to pre-drought levels.'' By the first week of August, rates from <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, to export points at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, averaged $ 6.85 per ton, up 12 percent from a year earlier. `` The decline in rates after the first week of July resulted from a sharp reduction in demand for barge service,'' the report said. `` As export volume shrank and producers held stocks in anticipation of higher prices, shipments of grain and soybeans in June fell 16 percent from May, and in July dropped 37 percent from May.'' According to the new outlook report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the higher transportation costs and reduced capacity sharply boosted prices of corn delivered by barge to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s Gulf ports. Between June 17 and June 23, corn prices rose from $ 3.31 to $ 3.32 per bushel to a range of $ 3.63 to $ 3.66 per bushel, the report said. `` These ports account for about 50 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain exports and receive 70 percent of the grain, chiefly corn, by barge,'' the report said. `` Similar price increases are anticipated in the poultry producing areas of the Southeast. Barges normally carry about a third of the grain shipped to these states.'' Trucks are not an alternative to barges for moving grain, the report said. A fully loaded barge holds 1,500 tons of grain, or about 35 truck loads. A mile-long truck convoy, bumper-to-bumper, would replace fewer than 2 -LCB- barges. `` One day, 1,760 barges were stacked above <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, 287 miles from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>,'' the report said. `` Grain in these barges would have filled a line of trucks 755 miles long.''

 A forecast by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that the cash receipts of farmers are likely to increase this year despite huge production losses due to drought has put economists to work explaining why. Cash receipts, or the gross from sales of crops and livestock, are expected to rise $ 5 billion to $ 9 billion this year from 1987, says the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. In 1980, another drought year, farm cash receipts climbed nearly $ 8 billion. Since droughts have an impact on production, why do n't cash receipts decline? `` One reason is that the prices of drought-affected commodities tend to increase more than production falls, raising the total value of the crop,'' the agency says in a new outlook report. `` Another reason is that marketing does not drop as much as production because stocks -LRB- inventories -RRB- are sold to make up the harvest shortfall.'' The economists say the demand for farm commodities is inelastic, meaning that a 1 percent decline in production, for example, leads to a price increase greater than 1 percent. `` Some farmers may benefit from the higher prices _ those in areas with adequate rainfall, those who irrigate and those with large unsold stocks of previous years' crops,'' the report said. `` However, higher cash receipts -LRB- nationally -RRB- do not imply that all farmers are better off because of the drought.'' The report added: `` Many farmers will suffer large declines in cash receipts if their individual production falls by much more than prices rise. Farmers in drought-stricken areas without large stocks of unsold crops from previous years have little to fall back on.''

<HEAD>Legal Opinion Notwithstanding, Changes Still Years Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Drug Enforcement Administration official created a stir last week with a formal recommendation to his agency chief that marijuana be made legal for limited medical uses, but any changes are still years away. The opinion by administrative law judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> amounted to a ringing endorsement of certain benefits from smoking pot _ mainly to help cancer patients tolerate highly toxic chemotherapy. Moreover, he concluded that federal law gives officials no choice but to change the way they classify the ancient weed. To do otherwise, he wrote, would be to act in an `` unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious'' manner. That is the legal jargon for the criterion courts use to decide whether administrators are acting within the laws they administer or are imposing their own desires. At the same time, however, <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s decision took tacit note of political realities that left even those strongly favoring his position doubtful that changes are likely for several years. <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, president of a small company called <ORGANIZATION> Cannabis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and a petitioner in the case, was jubilant with the decision because he believes there will be an eventual financial bonanza for his company. The key word is eventual. <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that he is not optimistic the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> administrator will accept the law judge's finding and predicted it will take at least two years before he and other petitioners can get federal courts to order the finding implemented. Then, he acknowledged, the matter would have to go to the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, a process he said probably would take at least two more years. There would be a certain irony in the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> being instructed by courts to deal with marijuana. Young noted in his opinion that the agency `` is looking at a synthetically formed new drug'' when it operates under the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION>, Drug and Cosmetic Act that gives it regulatory authority. `` The marijuana plant is anything but a new drug,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> wrote. `` Uncontroverted evidence in this record indicates that marijuana was being used therapeutically by mankind 2,000 years before the birth of Christ.'' To say it would be a voyage in uncharted regulatory waters for the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to regulate marijuana would be an understatement. The question is not before the agency now and efforts to get three separate and normally helpful <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials to discuss the issue _ even informally _ were unsuccessful. Young noted in his decision that the question is politically touchy. `` The judge realizes that strong emotions are aroused on both sides of any discussion concerning the use of marijuana,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> wrote. `` Nonetheless, it is essential for this agency, and its administrator, calmly and dispassionately to review the evidence of record, correctly apply the law, and act accordingly.'' He continued: `` There are those who, in all sincerity, argue that the transfer of marijuana to Schedule II will ` send a signal' that marijuana is ` OK' generally for recreational use This argument is specious. It presents no valid reason for refraining from taking an action required by law in light of the evidence.'' And the evidence, he said, clearly shows that smoking marijuana helps many cancer patients tolerate their treatment. His recommendation is that marijuana be moved from Schedule I _ strictly illegal except in research _ to Schedule II, whereby it could be prescribed by physicians but only under the same tightly controlled conditions that apply to such drugs as morphine and cocaine. His 69-page opinion, summing up a 15-volume record, is replete with testimony from physicians, patients and relatives that marijuana counters the nausea and vomiting that can be so severe in some patients it causes them to abandon potentially live-saving treatment. Young concluded that marijuana cigarettes are superior in many cases to synthetic capsules containing the active chemical present in the plant. `` Attempting to orally administer the synthetic THC capsule to a vomiting patient presents obvious problems,'' he said. `` It is vomited right back up before it can have any effect.'' Having concluded that the marijuana plant meets the first criterion of having a legitimate medical use, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> went on to address safety issues. `` In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume,'' he said. `` For example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response. By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death.''

<TEXT>
 The latest allegations of wrongdoing on Wall Street are boosting efforts in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to toughen penalties for insider trading, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s desire to see an unrelated banking law enacted could derail the effort. The House is scheduled to begin debate Tuesday and vote Wednesday on an insider trading bill sponsored by Reps. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION> It would double the maximum jail term for criminal convictions on insider trading charges and increase fines fivefold for firms and tenfold for individuals. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, at a meeting Friday of his <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on finance, predicted that the filing of government charges earlier in the week against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> would prod <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to quick action. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the chief of its junk bond unit, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, are named by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in a wide-ranging civil complaint alleging insider trading, fraud and other violations. `` These allegations should propel insider trading reforms ... into law by the end of this year,'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said. `` We will not permit the rich and greedy to treat our nation's financial markets as little toys to be played with and manipulated for private amusement and profiteering.'' The legislation passed the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> a month ago. Many in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also favor it, but the bill faces an uncertain future there. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., in a telephone interview Friday, raised the possibility of linking <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passage of the insider trading legislation to House action on a Senate-passed bill giving banks new powers to underwrite securities <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said he is conferring with other senators on his committee and has made no decision about linkage, but added, `` We want to hold all our options open.'' The banking bill, which passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on a 94-2 vote more than five months ago, would be the most comprehensive restructuring of the financial system since the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act barred banks from most securities business. A bill much less favorable to banks than the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> earlier this summer on a 31-20 vote and must go through <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s committee before it gets to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, in an interview broadcast Sunday by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> `` Business World,'' predicted insider trading legislation would pass <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year, but said of the banking bill, `` That's going to take longer if I have any say.'' However, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> argues that linking the banking bill to the insider trading measure would enhance the chances of both passing before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns early next month. `` I think they should help each other,'' he said. `` There's no reason why a -LRB- banking -RRB- bill with strong support in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will not bring strong support to insider trading legislation.'' The House insider trading bill would: _ Increase the maximum jail term for criminal insider trading from five years to 10 years _ Boost the maximum criminal fine from $ 500,000 for firms and $ 100,000 for individuals to $ 2.5 million for firms and $ 1 million for individuals _ Make it possible for securities firms to be fined for violations by their employees in cases where the firm `` knew or recklessly disregarded'' the facts _ Authorize the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to pay a bounty to whistle-blowers who give information to authorities _ Give investors who lost money by trading in the same securities as insider traders the right to sue inside traders for damages _ Grant new powers to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to cooperate with foreign countries investigating insider trading cases that involve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens The idea is to encourage other nations to grant similar reciprocal aid to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. Late in July, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> passed much narrower insider trading legislation including only the provisions on international cooperation. Last September, as part of a corporate takeover bill that failed to get through the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the banking committee approved increased fines and jail terms for insider trading.

 To <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the current occupant of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is blessed with `` a great sense of humor if you like jokes and stuff.'' What's more, he's `` not scary.'' That's how the Republican presidential nominee sized up President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> during an impromptu lunch with two fifth graders he plucked at random from a crowd at a downtown rally in <LOCATION> Pekin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, both 10, were invited by the vice president to dine with him at the Red Hen Restaurant He ordered a chicken sandwich for himself and hot dogs for his two young lunch partners. Talk turned quickly to sports and politics. `` What's your opinion of the Olympics?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked the two boys. Brent said he hoped to watch the games on television. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had just been to a sendoff in <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic athletes headed for <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> _ an event he said he enjoyed immensely. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked if either one lived on a farm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said he did, one with horses and cows, and that in fact his mother had just gotten a bad bruise in a riding accident on a `` really crazy horse.'' She was `` very lucky'' the horse did n't fall on top of her, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> observed, recalling the rodeo accident that claimed the life of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldrige </PERSON> in 1987. Brent then got his question in: `` What's the president like?'' `` He's a good guy, he's got a sense of humor if you like jokes and stuff. He's very, very nice, not scary, a guy you can talk to,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Some guys you can relax with and some you ca n't,'' he added. But the two fifth graders themselves were anything but relaxed. Not only were they eating lunch with the vice president in front of an imposing troop of photographers and reporters, but so much time had elapsed that they feared being stranded. They had come to town on a school field trip. `` How will you get back?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself wondered. `` I do n't know,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> responded glumly `` Somebody ought to tell them -LRB- the teachers -RRB- that they're here,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an aide The veep assured the two boys he'd make sure they got home _ even if it meant taking them for a ride in his motorcade. However, classmates had been waiting outside the restaurant _ and gave the pair a hero's welcome.

However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that he was rattled by one of the Three Little Pigs. `` He just kept staring at me, with this expression,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, making a funny face. `` My word of honor: I looked over there, and said, It's not the mouse that's bothering me.

<HEAD>Fiftieth Anniversary of Long Island-New England Hurricane Disaster</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 What may have been the worst natural disaster ever to strike the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> swept in unexpectedly a half-century ago this month, a great hurricane that claimed as many as 700 lives by some accounts. Born a few days earlier in a tropical depression, the great storm roared out of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> on Sept. 21, 1938, crossed <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> leaving a swath of disaster and crashed north into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The storm gave no warning, blasting a region where such weather furies are rare and usually fairly weak by the time they arrive. Coming before the era of satellite observations and rapid electronic communications, there was none of the advance notice so common today. `` It was the worst natural disaster ever to strike the northeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' says weather historian <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludlum </PERSON> in the magazine Weatherwise. `` The storm snuffed out the lives of some 700 unsuspecting people and injured thousands more. It destroyed or badly damaged 20,000 homes, summer cottages and farm buildings, as well as 26,000 cars and nearly 6,000 boats,'' <PERSON> Ludlum </PERSON> says. Historians knew of a major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> hurricane in 1815, but since then the giant tropical storms had generally only brushed that part of the nation, concentrating their fury on the South. So neither meteorologists nor residents of the region were prepared for the speed, direction and intensity of the 1938 storm. `` Those of us who were in the 1938 hurricane remember how it took us by surprise. Like the bombing of <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, it was totally unexpected,'' reported <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in his book `` Killer Weather.'' Like many tropical storms, this hurricane meandered near <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for several days before curving to the north, arriving off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> about 8:30 a.m. on Sept. 21. Suddenly, it set out on a speedy trip up the coast. To the north it was a warm, autumn day with no danger in the forecast. The Weather Bureau in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> issued a storm warning for the Northeast at 10 a.m., but by then the hurricane was already surging northward. Broadcast warnings were delayed in some areas because many radio stations were carrying a live speech by German dictator <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> at the time. `` By 3:30 p.m. the whole force of the hurricane smashed against <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Empire State Building was lost to sight as swirling, silver-sheeted clouds driven by 120 mile per hour winds engulfed and swayed it to and fro,'' reported <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> in the book `` Darkest Hours.'' Wind gusts would be recorded at 186 miles per hour before the storm was over. Along the island, beach houses of the rich and famous collapsed and were swept away. After blasting clear large expanses of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the storm surged across the narrow sound into <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, then headed north to batter <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> and even blast portions of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Disastrous flooding was reported in central <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The worst damage was reported along the coasts, though, with storm-whipped waves estimated at 20 to 30 feet in height. The waters of <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> were driven into <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, bringing normal life to a halt. Coming at a time of already high tide, the storm wiped out small beach resorts in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` What I saw that day will stay in my mind forever. Whenever before I had looked at the horizon it had been a straight line. ... Not that day. Gigantic waves moved along the horizon like the teeth of some titanic chain saw,'' wrote <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who viewed the storm as a youth in <LOCATION> Rockport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Along the storm track whole groves of trees were mowed down by the wind, an estimated 275 million trees being destroyed, according to <PERSON> Ludlum </PERSON>. Heavy rains swept the land and power lines were down nearly everywhere. `` By nightfall on this day of the autumn equinox, eastern <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and practically all of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> with the exception of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> lay stunned from the hurricane's blow,'' <PERSON> Ludlum </PERSON> wrote. His estimate of 700 killed and 1,500 to 2,000 seriously injured helps illustrate the confusion generated by the storm, for <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> reports the fatalities at 494, plus 100 missing and never found; while <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> estimates the dead at 680. Even with the better forecasting that today would give warning of the storm's approach, the potential for disaster remains. `` If such a storm should hit today, losses could be much higher,'' <PERSON> Ludlum </PERSON> warns. `` There has been a large increase in both summer and year-round populations in these areas, while property values have risen astronomically. This is particularly true along the shore. And should a full-fledged hurricane hit during the vacation season, when beaches and roads are packed, the potential for disaster would be appalling.''

 Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who has been the target of protests by homosexuals, condemned recent attacks of gays as the work of `` utterly stupid'' people. `` I wish I had language strong enough to condemn this kind of cruelty,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patrick </LOCATION>'s Cathedral before his sermon Sunday. `` Anyone who performs such actions in the belief that he or she is in some way helping society is utterly stupid,'' said the head of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> archdioces. `` Anyone who does such a thing thinking it is justified by church teaching about homosexual behavior is grossly ignorant of what the church actually teaches.''

<HEAD>Mountain Pine Beetle Cutting Deadly Swath Across The West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARNARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Swarms of mountain pine beetles are cutting a deadly swath through the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, creating fuel for forest fires as they kill huge, dense plots of trees from <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The insect, about the size of a big pinhead, destroys about 2 million acres of timber a year nationwide. Last year it ravaged 2.4 million acres, with more than half of that _ 1.4 million acres _ on the eastern side of the Cascade Range in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. The year before, 3.4 million acres were wiped out. By comparison, wildfires have consumed nearly 3.8 million acres this year, an area larger than <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. `` Basically, what we've had is a tidal wave rolling down to the south,'' says <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridgwater </PERSON>, an entomologist at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. The `` wave'' has been rolling through an area of lodgepole pine on the eastern slope of the Cascades in central Oregon. Though it prefers lodgepole, the beetle also attacks more valuable pine species such as ponderosa, sugar, Western white and whitebark. The result is large parcels of dead trees that amount to a tinderbox. About 4,000 acres of dead lodgepole helped fuel a fire that consumed more than 11,000 acres in the Deschutes National Forest this summer. Beetle-killed forest land also was a factor in the massive forest fires in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofacker </PERSON>, an entomologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s national headquarters in <LOCATION> Rosslyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` The lodgepole pine forest is regenerated through these fires,'' said <PERSON> Hofacker </PERSON>. `` In another 80 to 100 years it gets killed again by the mountain pine beetle. Ten to 15 years after that the trees start falling down, and the stage is set for another fire.'' <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, an entomologist in Bend, uses a chisel designed for cracking open human skulls on the autopsy table to dig into the bark of lodgepole pines that are as good as dead. `` I wish I could talk to these things,'' he said, uncovering a male beetle burrowing under the bark toward a female. Though the tree still looked green and healthy, it will be red and dead by next spring, overwhelmed by hordes of insects and the accompanying fungus that finishes off the trees. `` One tree will be selected by what you might call pioneer beetles,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. `` The females pick the tree out.'' Trees weakened by a lack of water emit a gas that the beetles can smell, <PERSON> Bridgwater </PERSON> said. The insects also are attracted to the biggest trees in the area, leaving smaller trees alone. Once the beetle starts boring into bark, it puts out a pheromone, or odor, that attracts other beetles. Thousands of beetles bore into the tree, enough to overcome the tree's main line of defense, which is to push the beetles out with heavy flows of sap. `` When the beetle has mated, it will begin to put out another odor,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. `` It says, ` This place is full.''' Beetles will move on to another tree. Within three years, they can move through an entire stand. What actually kills the trees is the fungus, whose spores ride along on the beetle's back. Researchers are looking at pheromones as a way of managing the beetles, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. Packets of the `` this place is full'' pheromone could be tacked up to protect trees in campgrounds and seed orchards, and packets of the `` come on in'' pheromone could be placed nearby in a stand slated for logging, he said. Besides firewood, the dead lodgepole is gaining popularity as a source of paper pulp because dead chips are lighter than green ones. `` I think it's pretty sure that by the year 2,000, most of the lodgepole pine -LRB- in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> -RRB- will be dead, whether it is harvested or not,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaydon </PERSON>, a marketing specialist for the four national forests in southeastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Most Teachers Feel Left Out Of School Decisions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A majority of public school teachers feel uninvolved in nearly all school matters except choosing texts and shaping curricula, a survey has found. Seventy-nine percent of those questioned said they feel involved in choosing textbooks and instructional materials, and 63 percent said they have a say in shaping the curriculum. But 10 percent or less of the 21,698 teachers surveyed by the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancment of Teaching felt they have any say in issues like teacher evaluation or selection of new teachers and administrators. And only 20 percent believe they are influential in tailoring school budgets. `` Whatever is wrong with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s public schools can not be fixed without the help of those inside the classroom. Yet in most states, teachers have been front-row spectators in a reform movement in which the signals are being called by governors, legislators, state education officials _ those who are far removed from the field of action,'' foundation President <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> said in a forward to the 14-page report titled, `` Teacher Involvement in Decisionmaking: A State-by-State Profile.'' The report revealed sharp disparities in the degree of involvement teachers felt in different states. In <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, for example, 93 percent of teachers reported a high level of involvement in choosing textbooks, 85 percent said they helped shape the curriculum, and 50 percent said they were involved in setting student promotion and retention policies. But only 63 percent of <LOCATION> Lousiana </LOCATION> teachers said they helped choose texts, 40 percent said they were involved in shaping the curriculum, 36 percent had a say in tracking students into special classes, and 1 percent felt they had influence in selecting new teachers. `` The report endorses what I have often said _ that teachers are treated like very tall children instead of professionals,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest teacher union with 1.9 million members. The 50-state teacher survey was conducted by mail in the spring of 1987 by the <ORGANIZATION> Wirthlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a polling organization in <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The poll had a margin of sampling error of less than plus or minus 1 percent. Among other results: _ 47 percent of all surveyed said they felt involved in setting standards of student conduct. The range was from 37 percent among teachers in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to 68 percent in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. _ 45 percent reported having influence in tracking students into special classes.

 <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s name is not on the ballot, but the ousted governor's conservative spirit looms over Tuesday's primary, as several of his backers challenge moderate Republican legislators who voted to impeach or convict him. The primary _ one of six around the country Tuesday _ marks <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s first election since the traumatic political upheaval of last spring in which the Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted to impeach <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and the GOP-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him of obstructing justice and misusing funds. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes removed him from office and automatically installed Democrat Rose Mofford, the longtime secretary of state, to serve in his place until 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> declined to bar <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> from ever running for office again. After his ouster, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> forecast `` a revolution at the ballot box,'' but he has n't predicted any casualty figures in the current primaries, and neither has anyone else. The former governor insists that those who keep talking about the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> factor are `` trying to divert the attention of the voters'' from the real issue: record tax and spending increases that were passed after his ouster to bail the state out of a deficit. `` It's ` Let's throw enough mud at <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> and make him the target so that we will change the issues from the voting records of the incumbents,''' he said. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a perennial political outsider, won the governorship on his fifth try in 1986 in a three-way race. His strengths included a get-out-the-vote campaign that mobilized his many ultraconservative supporters and a series of tabloids that attacked his opponents. In the current election, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Forward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has not distributed cash to candidates, and has handed out only a handful of formal endorsements. But it has conducted research and training for an unknown number of candidates. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> says he will support whoever wins the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary, but many Republican lawmakers fear his followers may simply refuse to vote for them in November even if they survive the primary. In a number of swing districts, that could hand the seat over to the Democrats. It has not been easy to determine the exact number of primaries in which loyalty to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> seems to be a main issue. Nine <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators and 26 representatives face at least one primary opponent, but not all of the incumbents voted against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and not all of the challengers are pro-Mecham. House members run in pairs, with voters in each district allowed to vote for two candidates. Among those facing primary challengers are the chief legislative architects of impeachment _ Republicans like <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary Chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelly </PERSON>. Lane will appear on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ballot along with <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, who says he would like to serve with <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, and two candidates who have <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s endorsement, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Shumaker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> is asking his supporters to cast just one vote instead of two and to cast that vote for him. Two former <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aides, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Humes </PERSON>, are running for the Legislature. <PERSON> Humes </PERSON> is unopposed for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nod to run against <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON> Lela </PERSON> <PERSON> Alston </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bellus </PERSON> is battling moderate <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbet </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nod to succeed retiring Republican Sen. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, an anti-Mechamite. On Friday, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> endorsed challengers <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellsworth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberds </PERSON> over <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Killian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mundell </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> area even though <PERSON> Killian </PERSON> voted against impeachment after a tearful speech castigating <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mundell </PERSON> voted for impeachment. Here are highlights of other primaries Tuesday: <LOCATION> MINNESOTA </LOCATION> _ Both GOP Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> and his likely Democratic opponent, state Attorney General <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, face minor opposition from within their parties. <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> HAMPSHIRE </LOCATION> _ Republican Rep. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> is favored to win the nomination for governor to succeed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who is retiring. Democrat <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McEachern </PERSON> has no primary opposition. <LOCATION> VERMONT </LOCATION> _ Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> faces conservative <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is the unopposed Democratic nominee. <LOCATION> UTAH </LOCATION> _ Democrats <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringham </PERSON> both seek the nomination to oppose three-term Republican Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielson </PERSON>. <LOCATION> WISCONSIN </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bucks </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and former Gov. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> are among four Democrats seeking the nomination for the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s motorcade was stoned during a campaign tour on the 15th anniversary of the bloody military coup he led that ousted the elected government of President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>. In the coastal resort of <PERSON> Vina </PERSON> del Mar on Sunday, nearly 5,000 protesters battled riot police following the largest ever memorial service at the grave of Allende, who perished in the coup. Reporters said Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s bodyguards opened fire after his motorcade was stoned in <LOCATION> Cerro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Navia </LOCATION>, a working-class suburb north of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. They said at least four protesters suffered bullet wounds. Police did not report any injuries or arrests in <LOCATION> Cerro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Navia </LOCATION>, but said 142 people were arrested in <LOCATION> Vina </LOCATION> del Mar when people tried to march from the cemetery into the resort's center. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the only candidate in next month's presidential referendum, was booed by hundreds of people when he arrived in <LOCATION> Cerro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Navia </LOCATION>. Many hurled rocks at his motorcade, and <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s bodyguards fired shots into the air as vehicles maneuvered around barricades of burning tires. Reporters at the scene said at least four people were struck by bullets and two were hospitalized in serious condition with stomach wounds. On Sunday night, demonstrations against the military government <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has led since the coup spread to the northern <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> Lo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pudahuel </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Quinta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Renca </LOCATION> and Conchalii, where protesters raised barricades of burning tires. No injuries were reported. Earlier in the day, in a nationally televised speech marking the Sept. 11, 1973, overthrow of Allende, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> addressed an audience of 3,000 people in a government office building. `` I am ready to give my last breath to my country,'' he said. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said Chileans were morally bound to support his sole candidacy in an Oct. 5 presidential referendum that, if approved, would give him eight more years of rule. The 72-year-old army commander said citizens face a choice in the yes-or-no ballot between `` consolidating the democratic society contemplated in the country's constitution or destroying 15 years of patriotic labor for <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.'' If a majority vote against his continued rule, an open election will be held next year and he will hand power over to the winner in 1990. Whether <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> wins or loses the vote, elections for a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are planned for 1990. But the legislature will be virtually powerless to amend an 8-year-old constitution that gives the armed forces freedom from civilian control and a role in national policy-making. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said his new government would be fully democratic. `` All sectors will be present,'' he said. But he attacked those who `` do not recognize the political system in effect, aligning themselves with totalitarian groups.'' A coalition of 16 parties, from the political center-right to the Socialist left, are campaigning actively for his defeat in the referendum. A leader of the opposition coalition, <PERSON> Genaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Arriagada </PERSON>, called <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s speech `` mediocre.'' `` Pinochet must be judged by his merciless exercise of power, and not by his words,'' he said. A government press office statement said police found and deactivated a time bomb in a car across from the building where <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> spoke. The statement did not explain how the car and its contents avoided earlier discovery by police, who had combed the area intensively and were seen to be towing away other cars hours beforehand. In <PERSON> Vina </PERSON> del Mar, 75 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, police used tear gas, water cannon and nightsticks to break up the nearly 5,000 demonstrators who tried to march through the streets after the tribute to <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist. Reporters saw a few demonstrators injured, including a young man bleeding from the head after being clubbed by two policemen. Authorities did not report any injuries but said 142 people were detained. According to the government, <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> shot himself in the head with a carbine as the Presidential Palace was in flames and under attack by troops. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> had declared he would not allow himself to be deposed and taken out of the palace alive, and the military version is accepted by most Chileans and historians. The military government had barred the placing of a tombstone to mark Allende's grave, but on Sunday there was a small marble plaque from the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. During the graveside ceremony, many mourners wept. After hearing a recording of <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>'s last speech to the nation, people in the crowd chanted, `` We can feel it, we can feel it, Allende is here.''

 Many of the 50 women who vied for the Miss America 1989 title and lost to <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> say they're looking forward to an exciting year as a state queen Miss <PERSON> Alabama </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, fourth runner-up in the 62nd Miss America Pageant, said Sunday she was happy to be headed home. `` They already treat me like I'm Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> down there,'' the 21-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> senior said. The mood of the 50 women after the pageant ended early Sunday was marked by expressions of glee, not gloom. `` No gripes here,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawaii </PERSON> <PERSON> Desiree </PERSON> <PERSON> Moana </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, one of 10 pageant finalists. `` This is one happy girl,'' said the 26-year-old from <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION>. `` Instead of being 5-9, I'm like 6-2. My feet have n't touched the ground.'' The new Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, a 22-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student who wants to be a Harvard-trained lawyer. Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> left this seaside resort on a yearlong tour of the country. For <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> and the other finalists, the competition was a chance to perform before a television audience of millions in what was probably a once-in-a-lifetime moment. `` I did what I came here to do,'' said third runner-up Miss <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <PERSON> Marlise </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricardos </PERSON>, whose emotional singing was one of the most polished performances of the pageant. `` I could n't believe I was standing up there,'' said the 26-year-old from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, who wants to be a movie actress. `` I knew that I did the best I possibly could have. I know I could have been Miss America.'' The contestants said that they saw no hint of nastiness or unfair competition among the women. `` There was no one that was out for blood,'' said Miss Mississippi <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Haag </PERSON>. `` I met and made some wonderful friends,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> said she recalls the contestants hugging each other backstage after the pageant, vowing, `` Friend for life. Friend for life.'' The contestants said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, the new Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, seemed quiet during the pageant, intent on the competition. `` To tell you the truth, I did n't really notice her,'' said Miss <PERSON> Haag </PERSON>.

 Newly crowned Miss America <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> car dealer's daughter whose brothers once called her `` blimpo,'' is a sushi-loving Swedish-American who hopes to be a corporate attorney. The confident new Miss America 1989 says chance did n't figure into her win. `` This was n't luck,'' she said just hours after her crowning in this seaside resort's Convention Center early Sunday, adding that she did n't bring any good-luck charms to the 62nd Miss America Pageant. The 22-year-old woman from the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Anoka </LOCATION> said her own skills brought her the crown. After winning a preliminary talent competition earlier in the week, Miss <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> said parts of her performance were `` exquisite.'' Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> performed a spirited violin solo titled `` Gypsy Airs.'' She has studied violin for 17 years, winning national and state violin competitions and performing a solo with the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Orchestra. `` I'm definitely an overachiever,'' she said. This year, pageant officials took special pains to emphasize that the judges were looking for an `` articulate, educated, dynamic role model'' and not just a beauty queen. Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> is several credits away from graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> with a degree in organizational behavior. She says she wants to attend <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> `` and become a successful corporate executive.'' But for the next year, Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> will tour the country promoting the Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> scholarship program. She also will push the products of the pageant's corporate sponsors, including underwear, orange juice, pantyhose and hair coloring. Last year's <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Lani </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafko </PERSON>, also used her reign to promote nursing. Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said she wants to focus on `` education for the children of tomorrow.'' Specifically, she wants to see children receive more education on values, `` teaching children to be less narcissistic.'' `` Today children tend to be more in love with themselves instead of being in love with other people,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. The new queen traveled later Sunday to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafko </PERSON>, who will stay on for several days to orient the new titleholder. Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> planned to pick out a personal wardrobe for the year and prepare for television appearances. When asked what kind of <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> she would make, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> laughed and replied, `` A short one.'' The 5-foot-3 Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> did n't have to bend when <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafko </PERSON> placed the crown on her head. At 108 pounds, she is 20 pounds lighter than the hefty 128 she weighed when she was 16. `` When I used to be fat, my brothers used to call me ` blimpo,''' she said, adding that she `` went on this major diet and lost all this weight.'' Today the green-eyed blonde of Swedish descent likes to dine on sushi. Sunday's crowning was supposed to be just before midnight Saturday, but was delayed almost 12 minutes after judges had to cast new ballots to break a tie for second runner-up. Miss <PERSON> Colorado </PERSON> <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> was named first runner-up, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Oklahoma </PERSON> <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> won second runner-up, <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <PERSON> Marlies </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricardos </PERSON> was third runner-up and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Alabama </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was fourth runner-up.

 Rock superstar <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ended his European tour with an outdoor concert organizers said drew 125,000 people, and officials said more than 1,500 of the fans were hurt in a crush near the stage. Organizers said the crowd at Sunday's open-air show on <ORGANIZATION> Aintree </ORGANIZATION> horse racing course at <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> was the largest ever at a rock concert in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In all, the volunteer first-aid workers of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambulance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> said they treated an estimated 3,400 fans for minor injuries, mostly hysteria, headaches and minor cuts. Brigade assistant commissioner <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Crook </PERSON> said 1,550 of the casualties were treated after being crushed at the front of the crowd near the makeshift stage because of the pressure behind them. Police said four of 40 people taken to <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Walton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> were admitted but none was in serious condition. One of the the injured was a 6-year-old girl who suffered bruising. Television cameras showed an unconscious young girl being passed over the heads of the crowd to ushers. Reporters said part of the crowd panicked after youths without tickets tore down fences to see the show. They said mounted police and officers in riot gear battled with the youths, who threw rocks at ushers. There was also fighting when youths tried to invade a stand reserved for holders of tickets costing $ 195. <ORGANIZATION> Aintree </ORGANIZATION> is only used once a year for the Grand National steeplechase and had never held so many people before, organizers said. Police said about 25,000 people gate crashed the concert, either with forged tickets or by breaking in. They said they arrested 22 people, mostly for disorder. Before the show, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said: `` I have always considered <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> the home of contemporary pop music by virtue of it being the birthplace of the incomparable Beatles.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has bought the rights to the Beatles' early hits and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aides said he wanted to tour places in the port city associated with the Fab Four but was advised not to because he might have been spotted and mobbed. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported without attribution that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was paid $ 3.4 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Aintree </ORGANIZATION> show.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Police and soldiers made no attempt to intercede as thugs with guns, knives and machetes attacked parishioners at a Mass said by an outspoken opponent of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s military rulers At least three people were killed in Sunday's massacre, said a foreign journalist who escaped, and radio reports said 60 were wounded. Some witnesses said as many as a dozen people were killed. Shielded by supporters, the Rev. <PERSON> Jean-Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> escaped uninjured. After the attack, gangs of armed men roamed the capital's deserted streets, stoning two radio stations and the headquarters of two political parties opposed to the government of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> Men fired shots about outside one of the stations, <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic-run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soleil </ORGANIZATION>, which went off the air after being pelted by rocks. A <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest and a former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate blamed the government for the attack, which preceded a planned Sunday protest against <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s voiding of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s popularly approved Constitution. Attacks on civilians by armed thugs accused of support from the military are not uncommon in the 2 -LCB- years since the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family dictatorship ended. On Nov. 29, 1987, armed thugs and soldiers killed at least 34 voters in thwarting independently run nationwide elections. On Sunday, <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> had just begun 9 a.m. Mass when a group of men started stoning the church, said the foreign journalist, who was attending. Then men shouting `` Communists, Communists!'' burst into the church, slashing and hacking mercilessly at men, women and children as they fled the church in panic, the journalist said. `` They started shooting people, beating them, and stabbing and slashing them,'' she told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone call to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They stabbed a woman who was pregnant. They stabbed another man who ran outside the church. He died. some people were shot.'' Another witness saw a pregnant woman shot in the abdomen. Soldiers at a compound across the street watched the violent attack but did not intervene. Asked for official government reaction, <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON>, director of information for the military government, responded, `` No comment before all the facts have been gathered.'' Some witnesses said about a dozen people were killed, but the bodies could not be removed before the attackers set the building on fire and torched cars parked out front. Some said they saw the assailants remove bodies from the churchyard. Radio stations reported 60 were treated for wounds. Estimates of the number of people in the church ranged from 600 to 1,600. A witness in the church's nearby health center said he watched as about 300 men fell into formation and marched to the entrance of the church compound, and stoned the courtyard and the church before a gang of them rushed inside. The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity. The Crusade for the <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, headed by the political opposition, had urged Haitians to dress in white Sunday to protest <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s voiding of the constitution in July. `` The relationship between the crusade and the massacre is obvious,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Adrien </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest. `` There is a campaign to bring the country back to the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> days, to re-establish a reign of terror, to prevent the people from organizing for their welfare.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Latortue </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate, said he was sure the church attack was the work of the government and its supporters. `` They have wanted to kill <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> for a long time,'' he said in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, where he teaches economics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puerto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rico </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is significant that the government tried to do this today, a day of protest.'' <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, who in sermons has compared <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s army rulers to savages and Satan, is one of the most popular figures among this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation's poor masses and has been the target of several assassination attempts. His modest, cement-block <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, inside a compound in the La Saline slum, is regularly packed with supporters. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> has never called for an armed uprising, but has repeatedly advocated the overthrow of the military government by what he calls `` active non-violent struggle.'' <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> returned to power in a coup June 19 after four months of civilian rule under President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ruled for two years before that as head of a junta after President <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled to exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Feb. 7, 1986. The constitution was approved by more than 99 percent of the voters in a March 29, 1987, referendum. It is considered the most liberal in the country's 184-year history and prohibited <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> supporters from running for office for 10 years.

<HEAD>Jersey City Schools Face Takeover; Parochial Schools Highly
Regarded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McMAHON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, where the public schools face a state takeover, many non-Catholic parents are sending their children to parochial schools, which they give honors grades. `` I'd much rather have this than public schools,'' <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, the mother of a first-grader, said, gesturing toward <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, an elemantary school cited by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> as exemplary. The Baptist woman said she is impressed by the structured education offered by parochial schools. Because of its educational failure, the 32,000-student public school system in this city across the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has been targeted for the first attempt by any state to seize control of a major urban school district. The district's graduation rate is 20 percent. Twenty-five percent of its students pass <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s mandatory proficiency exam, compared with 50 percent of students in other urban districts. Statewide, 80 percent of students pass all three sections of the test. State officials say the poor records mostly result from political patronage. State Education Commissioner <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooperman </PERSON> began legal action in May to take control of the city's schools. <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> officials have taken the matter before state Administrative Law Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>. Hearings before <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> are expected to last into January. The earliest the state could take control is May 1989, and appeals could delay that. In contrast, the city's 27 Roman Catholic schools have a high graduation rate, and send at least 75 percent of their graduates to four-year colleges, said the Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McDade </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Newark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archdiocese </ORGANIZATION>'s associate vicar for education. <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Catholic schools are educating more non-Catholics than ever and even turning away applicants, <PERSON> McDade </PERSON> said. Of the district's 11,000 students last year, 21 percent were non-Catholics. In some schools, the percentage was as high as 85 percent. `` There's much more discipline, much more structure in the Catholic schools,'' said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a Lutheran who sent her son <PERSON> Garrick </PERSON> to his first day of school at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>'s last week. `` I wanted him to get a good foundation,'' she said. `` I think it's pretty much common knowledge about the <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> public school system.'' An independent auditor's report on the public schools found `` the school climate is not conducive to learning, as facilities are poorly maintained and discipline is lacking. Principals are not in control of their buildings, and students and teachers are often not found where they are assigned and not focused on instructional purposes.'' Parents groups have complained of drug use and rampant absenteeism. `` The Catholic school seems to look for results and the public school seems to look for excuses,'' said City Councilman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, a critic of the school board. <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> public schools are providing the first test of a law enacted in January giving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> broad powers to take over chronically troubled schools. If the state wins the legal battle, it can abolish the local board of education, fire top administrators and appoint a state superintendent to operate the district for five years. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pikus </PERSON>, a lawyer for the city <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, said many problems date to a prior administration. Mayor <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cucci </PERSON> has objected to the takeover, saying the new law unfairly targets poorer districts that face insurmountable social problems and get inadequate state aid. Local school officials say a third of the district's students come from single-parent families and that hundreds more live in shelters for the homeless. Many students come from homes in which English is not the primary language. But, like the public schools, the Catholic schools reflect <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s ethnic diversity, <PERSON> McDade </PERSON> said. Among those enrolled at the parochial schools are Hispanic, black, Haitian, Portuguese, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, Egyptian, Filipino, Italian, Indian, Chinese and American Indian students. The average cost to teach each public school student amounts to $ 6,300 a year, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. Tuition for parochial school students averages about $ 1,600, officials said.

 <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, the youngest pilot to fly coast to coast solo, says he's ready for another challenge. `` We were thinking about maybe crossing the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> on my 17th birthday,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Sunday afternoon shortly after completing his flight from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>. `` We were just kidding around,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who turned 16 on Saturday, added quickly. The <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> teen-ager landed his single-engine <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> 201 at <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> less than 24 hours after leaving <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` I was n't nervous at all. If I got into trouble, I could have just landed,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who made refueling stops in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. The trip made him the first pilot of any age to make his first solo flight a transcontinental trip, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which sanctioned the undertaking. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> is two years away from being licensed to fly with instruments, and must rely on visual flight rules. Because of that, he said, he can not fly through clouds. `` We flew through some pretty heavy rain in some parts and then flew around a lot of clouds,'' he said. `` I had to dodge them. That was really fun.'' Flying ahead of <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> in a twin-engine <PERSON> Piper </PERSON> were his father, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>; <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattaway </PERSON>, his flight instructor for nearly four years; and <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> said he stayed alert by carefully following his progress on maps. `` I used to think from here to <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> was a pretty long flight,'' he said. `` But the trip seemed very short.'' Younger pilots have flown across the country with instructors, but federal regulations prohibit solo flights until the age of 16. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> has logged 100 hours of flying time and flew across country with another pilot when he was 13.

 A man ranked the wealthiest in the world runs this tiny oil-rich Moslem kingdom, and diplomats report little dissent from people unencumbered by income taxes, medical payments or tuition fees. King <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassanal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolkiah </PERSON> rules the enclave on the northeastern tip of <LOCATION> Borneo </LOCATION> from his 1,788-room palace. Earlier this month, Fortune magazine called him the richest man in the world, worth $ 25 billion. Citizens of this southeast <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation do not appear to object to the king's rule because he spreads some of the money around. `` They -LRB- the people -RRB- are well looked after, with free education, medical treatment, cheap housing, good pensions and any one doing well in his studies can easily get a university education abroad at the government's expense,'' said one diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said there are no beggars, and about half the workforce is employed by the government. The per capita income is estimated at about $ 18,000, one of the highest in the world, according to bankers and diplomats. All the money comes from oil and gas, which <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> exports mainly to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> government official said recently that 1986 exports amounted to $ 2.03 billion _ 99 percent of it oil and gas. Imports for the same year totaled $ 785 million in cars, foodstuffs and other goods. The nation, about the size of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, covers just 2,226 square miles, much of which is not suitable for cultivation, an agricultural officer said. Without daily newspapers, the nation's 227,000 people get their news mainly through state-run radio, Television <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> and some government publications. An official in the Planning Unit said Malays form the majority of <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>'s population, but there are also about 60,000 Chinese and other non-Malays. About 87,000 people are employed and of these 28,000 are foreign workers, including foreign maids, doctors, lawyers, engineers, accountants and others. <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> has no elected <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolkiah </PERSON> rules the nation with the help of a Cabinet comprising two of his brothers and about seven other people. The 41-year-old monarch, who studied in neighboring <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> before a stint at the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sandhurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, in 1966, was crowned the 29th King of <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> in 1967 by his father Sir <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Saifuddin </PERSON>, who abdicated in favor of his son. The king loves polo and has about 200 Argentine polo ponies, some of which are kept in air-conditioned stables. He has two wives and six children. In the 14th and 15th century, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> was a large empire stretching from the northern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to most parts of <LOCATION> Borneo </LOCATION>, but when the colonialists came <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> shrank. <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> became a British protectorate in 1906 and won its independence on Dec. 31, 1983. The country has no income tax, gasoline is cheap and there are no major taxes on cars, which are imported from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and elsewhere. Diplomats estimate foreign reserves at $ 20 billion. The King has powers to detain and hold without trial anyone deemed to be a threat to the security of the nation. On July 14, the government released 34 such detainees, leaving just six still in custody. Diplomats say there appears to be no long-term threat to <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>'s economy as the 120,000 barrels of oil being pumped daily is expected to last `` well into the next century''. <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> is officially known as <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> Darusalam. <PERSON> Darusalam </PERSON> means abode of peace `` and there is indeed peace here'' said a diplomat, who added `` they could have added prosperity to it.''

<TEXT>
 A letter attributed to a West German hostage by a <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper says the man expects to be freed Monday by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors. `` To the government of the Federal Republic of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, I should be freed on Monday,'' said the nine-line letter attributed to <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and published Monday on the front page of the independent newspaper An-Nahar. There was no way to authenticate either that the handwriting was that of <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, who has been held for 20 months, or that the statement was indeed from his captors. The quote about his release was the only one that could be fully understood from the handwritten letter. Other phrases, many words of which were illegible, said: `` Please inform my family'' and urged `` Please help the hostages.'' It was not clear if he was indicating he is being held with other hostages. It also was unclear whether the letter was an attempt to influence the ongoing trial in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who is charged with murder and air piracy in the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in 1987 after explosives were found in his luggage. His older brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, was convicted by a West German court in April of complicity in the kidnappings of <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and West German businessman <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> in a bid to free <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> was sentenced to 13 years in prison. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, kidnapped seven days before <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' Jan. 17, 1987 abduction, was released in September 1987. Another <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> brother, <PERSON> Abdul-Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, is believed to head the <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION>, which claimed responsibility for the kidapping of <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, 55, <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> manager for <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest chemical companies. <PERSON> Abdul-Hadi </PERSON> is also chief of the security apparatus of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. Other pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremist groups, all believed to be linked to one another, claim they are holding 17 other foreigners, including nine Americans. The hostage held the longest is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who was abducted March 16, 1985. <PERSON> An-Nahar </PERSON> said the letter was delivered to its <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> offices at dawn Monday along with an Arabic statement, signed by the Holy Warriors for Freedom. The Arabic-language statement said the German-language letter was written by <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>. The seven-line Arabic statement said: `` We would like to inform those concerned that new developments toward the release of the West German <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> will be announced within the coming 48 hours. `` Therefore, a representative of -LRB- Syrian -RRB- President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and the West German ambassador are requested to come to the Beaurivage Hotel within this period.'' The Beaurivage Hotel in the seaside <LOCATION> Ramlet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Baida </LOCATION> district is close to the command headquarters of Syrian troops in charge of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s security. There was no explanation for the discrepancy for the Monday release mentioned in the German letter and the 48-hour period in the Arabic release.

 The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen, while stock prices rebounded moderately in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today. The dollar closed at 133.42 yen, up 0.47 yen from Friday's close of 132.95 yen, with spot volume estimated at $ 4.8 billion. After opening at 133.82 yen, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency gradually declined, then reversed direction after Japanese trade figures for August were released late in the afternoon, said <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugiyama </PERSON> of the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` The trade surplus, $ 4.9 billion, was less than most of the investors had expected.

The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures are scheduled to be announced Wednesday. `` That's why some investors sold yen to buy dollars,'' <PERSON> Sugiyama </PERSON> added.

<HEAD>Gulf Coast Residents Mop Up After Florence</HEAD>

 Some Gulf Coast residents needed little more than brooms and rakes to clean up after Hurricane <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> came ashore and fizzled into a tropical storm, but forecasters kept a wary eye on Hurricane Gilbert in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. `` We got off very easy on this one,'' Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON>, said Sunday night `` It just happened to be a very weak storm and all the parishes involved were very well prepared.'' A preliminary report from the Office of Emergency Preparedness indicated no areas would qualify for federal assistance, <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON> said. Residents, many of whom have returned home after other hurricanes to find major damage, for the most part had only to clean downed tree limbs and blown debris after <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> came ashore Saturday. No lives were lost to the storm, officials said. `` We were very lucky on this one, and well prepared. We're just hoping <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> does n't head this way now,'' <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> churned westward toward <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> today after skirting the southern coasts of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Heavy rain and stiff winds downed power lines and caused flooding in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> on Sunday night. There were no immediate reports of casualties. `` We should know within about 72 hours whether it's going to be a major threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or not,'' said National Hurricane Center meteorologist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. `` We're trying not to think about it hitting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> yet _ that's a long way down the road.'' In <LOCATION> Delacroix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, a levee broke during <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON> said, but was repaired by Saturday afternoon and water was being pumped out of the area. The list of storm damage for the most part included downed trees and power lines. Utility companies estimated 100,000 people lost power because of the storm. Service was restored by Saturday night. Flooding as a result of the hurricane was limited to `` flood-prone areas,'' <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON> said. `` It was n't bad anywhere, at the worst, I'd say maybe 2 feet of water was in some places,'' he said. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who cut short a trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because of the hurricane, was briefed on storm damage Sunday, <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON> said 27,500 people were evacuated from low-lying homes, but had all returned by Saturday night. `` The evacuation went very smoothly; we were very ready for this storm. It turned out to be a small one, which was fine with us, but we were ready for it either way,'' he said. <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> hit on the anniversary of Hurricane <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON>, a killer storm that devastated southern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> 23 years ago. Since then, officials say, the state has beefed up the levee systems that protect low areas from flooding and instituted sound evacuation and storm procedures.

 A young man was stabbed to death and a dozen other people were beaten or knifed at a rap-music concert in this <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb, say officials who are contemplating a ban on such events. Knives and pistols were apparently smuggled inside Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum before Saturday night's violence even though the 10,000 people who attended `` Jam 88'' had to pass through an electronic weapons check, police said. Investigators believe a gang of about a dozen people may have been responsible for much of the violence, which apparently occurred during chain snatchings and other robberies, Deputy Chief <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> said Sunday. It was the latest in a series of violent incidents nationwide connected with concerts of rap music, rhyming songs with a driving beat and often-aggressive lyrics. Eight people were stabbed and at least five others were beaten during the concert, which featured such top rap stars as <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rakim </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kool </PERSON> <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fresh </PERSON>. Three of the stabbing victims were listed in critical but stable condition early today at <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Medical Center. Detective Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> described the gang as organized. `` It looked like these men had a discipline, a leader and a plan, and they carried it out with some precision,'' <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said. The plan involved surrounding the mugging victim and stabbing him so the thief could get away, <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said. The man who was slain, 19-year-old <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was stabbed once in the chest shortly after he entered the colisuem. `` He was with his girlfriend,'' <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> said. `` He resisted and he was stabbed in his upper chest.'' Ten of the wounded were taken to <ORGANIZATION> Hempstead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, but only two were admitted, said acting hospital administrator <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON> said only two were admitted. Both were in fair condition today, said a hospital spokeswoman who refused to give her name. Last month, two people were stabbed at a Run-DMC concert at the colisuem. <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> said the same gang may have been responsible. Police and coliseum officials will meet in the next few days to determine what steps should be taken to prevent violence, he said. Those steps could include a ban on rap concerts, said colisuem spokeswoman <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Mineola </LOCATION> is on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> about six miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 Solidarity advisors say round-table talks with communist authorities may not get off the ground unless the government shows it is willing in principle to reinstate the independent labor movement. On Sunday, a group of intellectuals and artists met with Solidarity chairman <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to endorse his participation in the talks. The roughly 60 advisors, calling themselves the Council on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, also demanded the immediate legalization of The government promised the talks on jointly solving <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic and social crises in exchange for an end to a nearly three-week strike wave and a mediator said Sunday that the discussions could begin this week A resolution adopted by the the advisors said: `` The most important condition for the beginning of a true dialogue between the civil opposition and the authorities -LRB- is -RRB- the legalization of Solidarity and the immediate implementation of pluralism.'' The labor unrest that began in mid-August and ended Sept. 3 posed the most serious threat to the government since it suppressed Solidarity with a 1981 military crackdown. Authorities had promised <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> in talks Aug. 31 that they would discuss legalizing Solidarity if he persuaded workers to end their occupation strikes. `` We are extending our full support in negotiations concerning this issue to the founder of Solidarity,'' Sunday's resolution said, referring to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. No date has been set for the talks with authorities, but <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>, the law professor who has been acting as a mediator in arranging the meetings, said they could begin this week. Union advisers said the talks might not get anywhere unless there is evidence authorities are willing in principle to legalize Solidarity. `` No round-table talks make sense unless at their first stage, or even in the preparatory stage, the authorities' intentions are made credible ... by some form of recognition of Solidarity's right to function legally,'' <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> aide, told reporters. Solidarity hopes for some signal on the government's willingness to recognize Solidarity during a preparatory meeting to be held with officials before the round-table talks, several Solidarity advisers said. Sunday's session was part of a two-day Solidarity conference in the northern port of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. About 100 people gathered after Sunday Mass in a room at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brygida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which serves as the headquarters of the Solidarity leadership. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> joined intellectuals, workers and regional Solidarity leaders for the session, chaired by <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, a historian and one of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s closest advisers. Included in the group of writers, actors and scholars were filmmaker <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Wajda </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> newspaper editor <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Turowicz </PERSON> and former head of the journalists' union, <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bratkowski </PERSON> A spokesman for the group, author <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Osmanczyk </PERSON>, told reporters during a break in the discussions: `` By means of recognizing pluralism we might finally become a normal state, where a majority of citizens control the ruling minority, like elsewhere in the world.'' At the Mass earlier, the Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> spoke to a congregation of 5,000 Solidarity supporters, stressing the need for unity in Polish society as the talks begin. `` Today there is a chance for round-table -LRB- talks -RRB- and we can not waste it,'' he said in his sermon. `` Just the opposite, we have to break down all the barriers, cast in solid concrete, to get there and sit at that table.'' <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON>, a Solidarity activist from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> who monitors human rights abuses in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for the union, said before Sunday's meeting that the mood was optimistic. He said Solidarity was more active and better organized than it has been in years. The union federation was banned the year after martial law was imposed in 1981.

<TEXT>
 Problems of distributing relief materials to millions of stricken people and combating the rapid spread of disease plagued this flooded nation today despite steady declines in river levels. President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> told a news conference his government has been trying to reach an estimated 30 million to 40 million people who were either marooned by the floods or in need of food and medical assistance. The flooding that started June 13 has claimed 866 lives, according to the government. Daily reports by <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers put the death toll at 1,647. The number of known diarrhea cases in the country continued to rise, with the government's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> reporting more than 211,000 cases nationwide. However, the pro-government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> today quoted relief officials as saying the number exceeded 300,000. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said 130 people were known to have died of diarrhea. He said he was unaware of any cholera cases, but doctors and newspapers said cholera has been diagnosed in patients who drank flood-contaminated water. About 5 percent of the patients admitted to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diarrheal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> had contracted cholera, according to a doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity. When asked about cholera at his news conference, <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said, `` I have no reports of cholera, but I will check up.'' Both illnesses have similar symptoms, but cholera is more serious and verified through laboratory tests. The doctor said 550 people suffering from diarrhea or cholera had been admitted to the diarrhea center since Sunday. Last month, the center averaged 155 patients a day. He said the current percentage of cholera cases was normal, even during non-flood periods. `` Cholera is endemic in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>,'' he said. Asked about the possibility of illness escalating as the flood waters receded, <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said: `` The fear of having an epidemic is already there.'' He noted that his country has only 8,000 doctors. In a country with a population of 110 million, that is a ratio of 13,750 per doctor, compared with one doctor per 5,000 in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and one per 780 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said estimates indicate 3.5 million tons of grain have been destroyed by the floods _ 20 percent of the grain needed to feed the country this year. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said foreign pledges for flood relief have reached about $ 280 million. He said the rebuilding of roads washed away by the floods would require at least that amount. About half the aid offered so far has come from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has pledged nearly $ 150 million in wheat, wheat seeds and cash for emergency airlift assistance as well as contributions to international agencies such as Save the Children, CARE and World Vision Relief and Development. An American C5-A Galaxy trasnport plane arrived in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> today, carrying water tanks and purification units and plastic sheeting to be used for temporary shelters. The floodwaters have covered three-fourths of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>. `` For centuries the people of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> have lived with floods, but never before have the rivers unleased such fury on her people,'' the president said. The <ORGANIZATION> Flood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said today that all major rivers were falling but remain above flood level. The Brahmaputra dropped 8 inches at some stations since Sunday. The smaller <LOCATION> Buriganga </LOCATION>, which has flooded about half of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, dropped 2 inches during the same period. `` The flood situation in the country is steadily improving,'' said one control center official, speaking on condition of anonymity. On Sunday, <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> called for water experts from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> to meet to discuss flood-control in the region, which is hit by annual monsoons from June through September. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> told a gathering in the northern township of <LOCATION> Grudaspur </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> did not have the expertise nor resources to tackle the problem alone.

 Somber Cabinet officials demanded the federal government's `` let-it-burn'' policy be revised after touring the fire-blackened West, and promised to send 1,200 Marines and other soldiers to help fight wildfires. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> IV and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> on Sunday toured the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which coordinates Western firefighting. Earlier in the weekend the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members, sent to the West by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, inspected fire damage in Yellowstone National Park. `` The most important thing is to concentrate our efforts on getting these fires under control and then out,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said Sunday. `` The old policy has to be reviewed and altered.'' The 16-year-old policy allows fires ignited naturally to burn within wilderness areas and national parks unless they endanger people or property. Wildfires on conventional national forest or rangelands are fought with available resources, he said. In that time, 16,000 fires have burned a total of about 30,000 acres in the park, <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. About 900,000 acres of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> have burned. At Old Faithful geyser, <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> announced that two Marine battalions _ 1,200 men, from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and two <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> battalions would be dispatched to the firelines. The Pentagon has already sent 2,300 Army soldiers to help hard-pressed fire crews. `` So by the end of next week, we will see a doubled representation by the military in this effort,'' <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said. Some critics of the `` let-it-burn'' guidelines, including Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., have called for the resignation of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> for adhering to the policy Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Idaho </LOCATION>, has called for an `` immediate and sweeping'' re-evaluation by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s forest management `` We need to emphasize that there are thousands of men and women on the fire lines who need our support,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. `` We've received some expressions that indicate the ` Monday morning quarterbacking' already going on is undercutting their morale. `` The park is still there,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. `` There's a great deal of natural beauty and wonder still to see. We do have devastation to the vegetation, much of it along roadways where visitors will see it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> has received a dusting of snow, slowing the spread of the blazes criss-crossing the park. But the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary said forecasts of warmer weather this week could bring them back to life. The <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> manages supplies and personnel for large fires involving overhead management teams. It has transported nearly 2.7 million pounds of equipment to the blazes this year with a total cost of about $ 15 million, said <PERSON> Sandi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacher </PERSON>, BIFC fire information officer. Some 68,490 fires have burned more than 4 million acres this year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sandi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacher </PERSON>. The Department of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> oversees the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, while the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> manages the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.

 A waiting crowd cried, laughed, cheered and sang as 671 Cubans who had been exiles in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> arrived by air after months or years of separation from relatives living in south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` This is the happiest day of my life,'' a teary-eyed <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Socarras </PERSON>, said after being reunited with her daughter, <PERSON> Zoila </PERSON> <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, on her arrival Sunday from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` I have wanted to live in this country all my life.'' Ms. <PERSON> Sacarras </PERSON> had been waiting in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for a visa since 1984, when she left <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Three planes _ two from <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and one from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ brought the exiles in an operation organized by the Miami-based Cuban <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the first private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> group to sponsor refugees under a recently approved federal program. There were 293 refugees from 102 families aboard the first flight, which arrived from <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> early Sunday at Miami International Airport. `` It was extremely exciting,'' foundation staff member <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> said. `` They were all tremendously happy to see their family members, family members who they have n't seen in years.'' Sixteen Cubans who had been scheduled to arrive Sunday were left behind in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> because of minor problems with their paperwork, foundation spokeswoman <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreira </PERSON> said. All were expected to travel to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> by month's end, she said. Under a special agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the arriving refugees were whisked through Customs, immigration and public health checks at a special staging area set up to speed them to official welcoming ceremonies and family reunions at suburban <LOCATION> Tamiami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. School buses donated for the occasion carried the new arrivals to the ceremonies directly from the international terminal gates. The new immigration program allows up to 4,000 refugees to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to live if they obtain private sponsors and proof they have support and medical coverage for two years. The arrival of the three planeloads of refugees marked the end of a two-year effort by the foundation to get Cubans here from third countries, where they had gone in hopes of eventually making it to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Volunteers spent the past week telephoning relatives of the refugees, preparing legal work, coordinating bus trips and stuffing welcome bags of black beans, rice, coffee, condensed milk, soda and guava. One man handed out dollar bills to arriving children. `` I want them to get their first dollar in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from me,'' said <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, who had no relatives arriving on the flights.

Many Western governments, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have increased aid to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and endorse its contention that the rebels receive covert logistical and communications aid from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> insists it no longer aids the rebels, and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> is expected to try to convince <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> to mute the allegations. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, whose plane departed from an air force base at <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, was accompanied by his defense minister, Gen. <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>, and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>'s delegation, which left <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> for the northwestern town of <LOCATION> Songo </LOCATION> early today, included three <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers and two military commanders, according to the Mozambican news agency AIM. In the past year, as part of an effort to improve its regional image, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has expanded its trade mission in <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> and pursued economic development possibilities in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. The two countries also have signed an agreement aimed at rehabilitating <PERSON> Cahora </PERSON> <PERSON> Basso </PERSON>, the giant hydroelectric project in the northern, war-torn province of Tete, so that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> can purchase electricity. The rebels repeatedly have sabotaged power lines leading from <LOCATION> Cahora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basso </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Even when their relations were badly strained, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> maintained extensive ties. Tens of thousands of Mozambicans work as miners and migrant laborers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>'s electricity is supplied by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, during his 10 years in power, has had few chances to travel in black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In 1986, he was one of numerous dignitaries who attended the coronation of <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Mswati </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, and in 1987 he made a secret visit to South African troops fighting in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. He had hoped to visit <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, earlier this year in conjunction with peace talks on <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> allies reportedly threatened to scuttle the talks if he went.

 The Guggenheim Museum received a $ 1,000 donation toward its expansion plans from a man who shows up at the Fifth Avenue institution every day _ but has never gone in to see the art. <PERSON> Fotios </PERSON> <PERSON> Velis </PERSON>, a Greek immigrant who has been selling hot dogs and other snacks from his cart in front of the museum for 13 years, said he wanted to make the gift to say thanks. A museum spokeswoman called the gift `` particularly gratifying.'' <PERSON> Velis </PERSON>, 35, came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in 1976 and had his own cart by his second day. Since then, he estimates he's sold about 1 million hot dogs. `` This is my new country and I had to show my gratitude by becoming a success,'' he said Sunday. Why has he never gone in to see the museum's displays? `` I'm working when they are open,'' he said.

 Officials from the city, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> will meet with a federal judge this week to fine-tune a desegregation plan that emerged as the city teetered toward the edge of bankruptcy. The conference comes after two councilmen changed their minds and voted early Saturday to accept the judge's plan following a series of noisy and emotional City Council meetings. They switched after lawyers from the city and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> agreed on a compromise housing plan the councilmen hope <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON> will accept. Fines imposed by Sand on the city reached $ 1 million a day on Friday, forcing the layoffs of hundreds of workers that would have taken effect Saturday had the councilmen remained defiant. Now, the fines and layoffs are on hold. Sand told lawyers for the city, the federal government and the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> to gather Wednesday to go over the alternative plan. Sand could accept the new plan or again order the city to abide by his original order. Sand had called for 200 units of low-income public housing on a number of sites scattered throughout mainly white neighborhoods and 800 units of middle-income subsidized housing scattered throughout <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to the original plan earlier this year and the city agreed in a consent decree to follow it. But officials disagreed on how it should be implemented. The new city-NAACP proposal would substitute two new housing sites for one of the original seven; mix some low-income units with more expensive ones; substantially alter the style and mix of the housing; rehabilitate some existing housing; and create a new organization to manage the housing. `` There is a sense of hope,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> after preaching Sunday morning to his predominantly black congregation at the Messiah Baptist Church. `` We have crossed the first hurdle, yet we have a healing process that is still occurring.'' `` We have to take an active role now and make sure this -LRB- plan -RRB- does work,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chema </PERSON>, a councilman who was called a `` snake'' by a resident after he switched his vote. But the alternative plan has its detractors. `` What we're doing is creating slums,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON>, one of two councilmen who voted `` no'' Saturday. `` After we put the first one in and it starts to deteriorate like all public housing does, we're going to have a multitude of problems.'' <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON> said the council's action `` probably reduced the value of every house in <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> by a minimum of $ 50,000, and as much as $ 100,000.'' Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he would appoint a task force and Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> promised to arrange a meeting between city officials and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Mayor <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON> said Saturday's vote was a watershed, because it meant the council would now work with the court. `` None of us are comfortable with the court's plan,'' he said, `` but the court imposed it because the council refused to get involved.'' <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Longo </PERSON>, the other councilman who changed his vote, said the impending layoffs transformed the mounting fines from the abstract into reality. <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON> said he ran into an east <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> resident who had been a vehement opponent of the housing plan: `` The other day he was standing in front of his house, knee deep in garbage. He says, ` It's time for integration.''' <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON>'s mother, a library clerk, was among those who was to be laid off. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed the desegregation lawsuit in 1980 and was joined by the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, and three years ago Sand ordered an end to segregated housing and schools in <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>. On Aug. 2 he had found the city of 194,000 in contempt of court for the council's refusal to carry out a housing desegregation order it approved earlier this year.

 Former Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> promised supporters at his 71st birthday party that he would return to his homeland without resorting to violence. `` It is my habit every birthday to ask, ` Who am I? What have I done to be remembered in history?''' the exiled <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> told about 3,500 supporters at a celebration here Sunday. `` Today I am faced with the greatest crisis that has confronted me. God knows who I am. But how will the people know?' `` Am I a scoundrel? A thief of ill-gotten wealth? I am no scoundrel,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said, adding that the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government should allow him to face accusations in person. `` I will go back, I intend to go back, at any price, without violence,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said. `` I say face me now, or face the verdict of history.'' Several criminal and civil lawsuits filed by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' opponents in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accuse the ousted leader of plundering billions of dollars from his country during his 20-year rule. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has filed a petition to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, but President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has denied his request. Thousands of supporters, many wearing T-shirts or waving placards bearing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' likeness, yelled `` Bring Home Marcos'' and `` Mabuhay Marcos,'' which in the Philippine language <LOCATION> Tagalog </LOCATION> wishes a long life. <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, dressed in a long, turquoise-colored gown and several pieces of gold and diamond jewelry, addressed the crowd in <LOCATION> Tagalog </LOCATION> but switched to English to say `` the only hidden wealth of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is in his heart and his mind _ enrichment and enlightenment.'' The event _ which was part birthday party, part floor show and part political rally _ was sponsored by the local group `` Friends of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who has lived in exile here since February 1986, was greeted by cheers and choruses of `` Happy Birthday'' when he and his wife arrived through a back entrance at the <ORGANIZATION> Blaisdell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arena </ORGANIZATION>.

 About 150 disciples of Indian guru <PERSON> Bhagwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shree </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON> spent the weekend taking a final look at the isolated central <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> ranch that served as the sect's showplace. <PERSON> Rancho </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON>, 64,000 acres of sagebrush-dotted hills on the high desert, will be sold at auction next month. It had been for sale for $ 28 million, but fell under foreclosure proceedings by <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's such a beautiful place, such a peaceful place and this planet has no use for it,'' said <PERSON> Swami </PERSON> <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Niren </PERSON>, the American lawyer who serves as <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON>'s `` ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` Nobody wants to put the resources into even using it for what it's already been built for ... a great big meditation center.'' The commune, incorporated as <LOCATION> Rajneeshpuram </LOCATION> on part of the ranch, was home to thousands of red-clad disciples from 1981 to 1985. They toiled 12-hour days and showered <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON> with jewels and Rolls Royces that he used for daily drives past lines of singing, clapping followers. The commune disbanded in 1985 after the guru pleaded guilty to federal immigration charges. Under a plea agreement, he received a suspended 10-year sentence, paid a $ 400,000 fine and agreed not to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for five years without the written permission of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general. <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON>, 56, returned to <LOCATION> Pune </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, where he carries on his meditation teachings as the self-described `` guru of the rich.'' The `` family reunion and picnic'' drew about 150 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> disciples who endured the perilous gravel road into the ranch to tour the abandoned buildings and reminisce about the commune's heyday The reunion `` happened by itself,'' <PERSON> Niren </PERSON> said. `` Some people wanted to come here and be here while it's still possible.'' The gathering was closed to the public except for a news conference Sunday at which <PERSON> Niren </PERSON> reiterated accusations that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government destroyed the commune and poisoned <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON> after he was arrested. <PERSON> Niren </PERSON> acknowledged, however, that he had no evidence of such a crime. The news conference followed an emotional singing and meditation session outside the house where the guru lived. Tears streamed down the faces of several disciples as <PERSON> Niren </PERSON> recalled the turbulence that marked the commune's downfall. He criticized the reign of <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Anand </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheela </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rajneesh </PERSON>'s personal secretary who is in federal prison. `` She's just another power-hungry politician,'' <PERSON> Niren </PERSON> said. Among those on hand for the news conference was <LOCATION> Wasco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hulse </PERSON>, who said he came to the reunion when offered a ride by the county sheriff. <PERSON> Sheela </PERSON> was convicted of assault for handing <PERSON> Hulse </PERSON> a glass of poisoned water. `` I did n't want the people out here to think I was going to rub it in,'' <PERSON> Hulse </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> says a new biography's portrayal of her late husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, as a violent, schizophrenic drug addict is akin to a second murder. `` It's like <PERSON> John </PERSON> has been assassinated twice,'' she said in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` I thought of <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s wife who committed suicide, but I'd never do that because of <PERSON> Sean </PERSON>,'' she added, referring to her and <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s son. But the author of `` The Lives of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, said in an interview in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that he was sticking by the claims he made in the best seller. `` If you were to encounter the real <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> and live with him for six months, I think you would be very disgusted,'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said. The former Beatle, who was killed in front of his <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment building on Dec. 8, 1980, did not have anorexia or dyslexia, as the book claims, <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> said. `` These are very serious diseases and, fortunately, <PERSON> John </PERSON> did not have any of them,'' she said. `` But it's not fair to laugh at all the people in the world who suffer from these diseases.'' She also took issue with <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION>'s claim that <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> had an affair with Beatle's manager <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>. `` I was his wife and I just know he was n't homosexual,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` I can say that for certain, but if he was bisexual there was no reason he could n't have told me beause we did n't think there was anything wrong about that.'' She acknowledged that both she and <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> used drugs at one time, but said they both had `` conquered it.'' <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, 12, called the book `` outlandish.'' `` At first, I thought -LRB- it -RRB- was very serious, but then I realized it was just a big joke,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. In the Times interview, <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> admitted making some factual errors in the book, but maintained there were no errors `` on which a great deal turns, like the interpretation of an episode, or a major point.'' <PERSON> Ono </PERSON> told the Times: `` I think the book is trash. It's not even good reading.'' She planned to offer a rebuttal to the book, using excerpts from <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> interview tapes as well as comments from <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> and others, on Wednesday night on a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> radio station.

<HEAD>EPA Should Concentrate On Global Pollution Problems, Scientists
Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> should change its approach and concentrate on early detection and prevention of new pollution, say more than 40 scientists, according to a report published today. The critical report, scheduled to be released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week, says the agency's focus on cleaning up known pollution is inadequate for coping with modern environmental problems, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. The report was commissioned 17 months ago by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief administrator. `` We really do n't know how environmental changes are affecting natural systems,'' said <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Alm </PERSON>, a former top <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> official who directed the report. <PERSON> Alm </PERSON> now is president of <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` There are really dire consequences. We're worrying about small problems now compared with the potential global impact of these changes,'' he said. <PERSON> Alm </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> `` desperately needs'' a long-term research and development program that takes into account consequences of problems such as global warming. The report calls for an early detective system for environmental problems and for the creation of an environmental research institute that would be financed by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> but operated by a university or other independent contractor.

The job has been held by political appointees since <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> was formed in 1970 and no one has served more than three years since then, the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said.

The report says that despite the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s `` original charter to take a long-term view of human health and environmental quality, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has had to devote a larger and larger share of its budget to the support of near-term regulatory development required by environmental law.''

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> traveled today to the violence-wracked provincial capital of <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> and preached reconciliation and peace. `` It is only eight years since your struggle for national independence -LRB- in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> -RRB- was brought to an end,'' the Roman Catholic pontiff said. `` Even after that, many people in <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> did not find true peace. ... The civilian population continued to suffer from guerrilla warfare and other forms of violence.'' The pope celebrated Mass at Ascot Race Course on an altar festooned with white <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> lilies. Many in the crowd of 50,000 waited at the race track six hours for the Mass. The pope began the Mass speaking in <LOCATION> Sindebele </LOCATION>, the tribal language of the Ndebele of <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> flew from <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, the capital, to <LOCATION> Bulawayo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s second largest city and provincial capital of <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION>, early today He was welcomed by <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON>, a senior minister in the government and the province's political chief. The pope's one-day visit to this western province is the most sensitive part of his three-day trip to <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, which began Saturday. The pope is to travel on to the black-governed countries of <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> during his 10-day tour of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Before the Mass, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was welcomed by Bishop <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlen </PERSON>. In 1984, the Swiss-born <PERSON> Karlen </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> clashed after <PERSON> Karlen </PERSON> accused government troops of atrocities involving hundreds of civilians in <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> denied the allegations and accused the bishop of siding with rebels. `` The people of <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> have suffered much during the liberation war,'' <PERSON> Karlen </PERSON> said in his welcoming speech. `` The blood of 10 missionary martyrs of the diocese of <LOCATION> Bulawayo </LOCATION> has flowed into the soil of this area. May this blood bear abundant fruit.'' Until recently, <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> was the center of a tribal-based insurgency that began shortly after <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> gained independence in April 1980. Hundreds of people were killed in the conflict between the rebels and government troops, among them the 10 <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> missionaries. Suspected rebels shot and killed <PERSON> Killian </PERSON> <PERSON> Knoerl </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> diocese on April 19, hours after the government announced a general amnesty for rebels. The government said 113 rebels surrendered under the amnesty and that there have been no rebel-related killings since. The amnesty came four months after <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON>, formerly his chief political rival, signed a unity accord. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> led rival guerrilla armies during the seven-year war that led to white-ruled <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> becoming black-ruled <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, a member of the <PERSON> Shona </PERSON> tribe that accounts for 70 percent of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s 8.5 million people, accused <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> of controlling the rebels in <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON>'s Ndebele tribal stronghold. <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> denied the charge.

 Proving that time heals all wounds, a lawman presided when this Gold Rush town paid tribute to <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Bart </PERSON>, the Old West stagecoach robber famed for his calling card poems. About 2,500 people turned out during the weekend for a parade, barbecue and dance to celebrate the release of the `` Gentleman Bandit'' from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> 100 years ago. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Claudino </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol officer, was the parade chairman. `` Some people might think it is a little odd to pay so much attention to a stagecoach robber, but <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> really was quite a dapper thief,'' <PERSON> Claudino </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> was the alias of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON>, who robbed 28 stages between 1875 to 1883 before he was caught and served five years in prison.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> officials say the elimination of 4,000 workers was the only way to end mounting losses, but union leaders warned that the latest round of firings dooms the company's ability to compete Dozens punched their time cards for the last time here this weekend as part of a cutback that eliminates Eastern service to 14 cities and drops the carrier's workforce to 30,000. Less than four years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had 42,000 workers. `` We're back on death watch again,'' said <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferer </PERSON>, a vice chair of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> representing flight attendants. Eastern officials acknowledge the cuts are painful, but said something had to be done. `` The fact is we have lost over a billion dollars in this decade,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>, the company's chief spokesman. `` We have to take prudent, although admittedly painful, measures.'' Union leaders say laying off employees will drive up labor costs per flight because the less-senior workers being laid off were paid less than those who remain. `` The last thing you want to do in the airline industry is downsize,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of District 100 of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s largest union with nearly 12,000 workers. `` Many of the costs are fixed, and the break-even yield goes way up. It's a lose-lose proposition that just feeds on itself. Of the 4,000 jobs eliminated, 1,500 were non-union positions, including management and clerical. Some 500 pilots positions are being eliminated without layoffs by having pilots clear backlogs of vacation time, and some 400 flight attendants are taking one-to-six-month leaves of absence, the company said. A few hundred more flight attendants, mechanics, baggage handlers and ramp agents are taking early retirement or simply quit, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said. Eastern is $ 2.5 billion in debt and its cash reserves dwindled from $ 560 million to $ 420 million in the quarter ending June 30. President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said Eastern was cutting out money-losing Western routes and its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hub, along with some sluggish <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> routes. The company estimates the new cuts will save $ 100 million a year. The Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, chaired by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, took over Eastern two years ago. Eastern's unions will make arguments against the layoffs later this month in the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which allowed <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to go ahead with the layoffs after it posted a $ 4.7 million bond to pay back salaries if workers are later ordered reinstated.

<TEXT>
 More than 1,000 primary and secondary school students fasted today as thousands of demonstrators marched through <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> to press for an interim government to lead <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> to democracy. Key opposition leaders jointly rejected the government's plan to hold a general election, and reiterated demands for an interim government. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> met with the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> to work out polling details, naming <PERSON> Ba </PERSON> <PERSON> Htay </PERSON> as commission chairman. The students, age 10 to 17, began the 36-hour fast Sunday at the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> General Hospital compound. The students held up banners and shouted `` Give Us Democracy!'' and `` Give Us Interim Government!'' They said their fast would end tonight. Meanwhile, many thousands of student-led demonstrators marched through the capital to press for an interim government and multiparty democracy. More soldiers were seen on the streets today, but they did not interfere with the protesters, who dispersed peacefully. President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> has rejected the call for an interim government. But Saturday he bowed to weeks of nationwide protests and announced the ruling party would hold the first multiparty general election since 1960. Parliament on Sunday authorized the government to amend the constitution to permit a multiparty system and hold the election in as little as six weeks. But the demonstrators clearly remain skeptical of the promise and the protests have continued. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> scholars note the present constitution is designed to support single-party rule, and would have to be virtually scrapped rather than amended to permit multiparty elections. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> expert <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON>, contacted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, said the constitution gives the president and central government great power, and enshrines the rigid party policies known as the `` Burmese way to socialism.'' Said another <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> specialist, <PERSON> Bertil </PERSON> <PERSON> Linter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>: `` It's impossible to hold elections within the present constitution. Opposition leaders <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, former Defense Minister Tin Oo and <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> issued their demand for an interim government in a letter to <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>. It was the first joint statement from the three opposition leaders. None of the three have specified who should be in the interim government, saying only it should comprise people outside the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> who are `` acceptable to all the people.'' They also have not said if they would be willing to serve in a transition government. `` Since the government has lost the confidence of the nation, people will have no confidence in the general elections to be held by the government-appointed election supervision commission,'' the statement said. It said when an interim government is formed, striking public employees will return to work, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> will regain normal economic activity and general elections would be organized. Parliament set a target date of three months for the holding of the multiparty elections, but empowered the government to make it earlier or later if necessary. It also appointed an election commission comprised of three retired civil servants, a retired army brigadier general and a former member of Parliament. The men, all over 70 years of age, are generally regarded as neutral. At least four are not members of the ruling party. The last multiparty elections were in 1960. The elected government of Prime Minister U Nu was overthrown in a 1962 coup led by Gen. Ne Win. Over the next 26 years, <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> and the military crushed dissent and pursued rigid socialist policies that made resource-rich <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> one of the world's poorest nations. Economic woes the past year have fueled nationwide protests in which hundreds were killed. The protests forced the resignations of Ne Win on July 23 and successor <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> Aug. 12. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> took power Aug. 19 as the country's first civilian leader since 1962. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> has called for an end to the pro-democracy strikes and warned that lawlessness and destruction of public property must end immediately. He called for immediate removal of administrations set up by <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and students in towns nationwide where central government control has disintegrated.

<HEAD>Students Angry Over Change In Oral Roberts U. Scholarship Policies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oral <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> medical students say they feel betrayed by the cancellation of a scholarship program funded after evangelist Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said <PERSON> God </PERSON> would end his life unless he raised $ 8 million. Although the television preacher-faith healer said the donations would fund full scholarships for medical students at Oral <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, those scholarships turned out to be loans. New students at the <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, school have been told the university has canceled the scholarship program for them. Students also complained <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> has pressured them to keep quiet about their dissatisfaction, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. Several students said that at the semester's opening chapel service, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> told them not to grumble, warning: `` Keep your cotton-pickin' mouth shut!'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, on his TV programs and in letters to donors this year, has insisted he never promised the medical students anything beyond one year's help. Officials in <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' ministry and the medical school declined requests for comment. During last year's $ 8 million fund-raising drive, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> repeatedly said the donations would fund full scholarships for medical students. But the four-year scholarships turned out to require students to work as medical missionaries for four years after graduation to repay the $ 93,500 in scholarship funds. The contract also said: `` ORU makes no promise or warranty whatsoever that additional medical school scholarship loans will be made in future years.'' `` Future years'' is not defined. In a memo Feb. 1, however, the medical school students were informed by Assistant Dean <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> that the Healing Team Scholarship Loan program would be canceled at the end of the 1987-88 academic year. Students who stayed in the medical school for the next three years would have to pay as much as $ 71,000. Those who transferred were told they would have to pay back the money they had already received at 18 percent interest. The `` restated loan agreement'' also prohibits students from borrowing from `` any source other than ORU ... except with written approval of President Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and the Board of Regents.'' At least 25 returning students have sought legal advice regarding the new document. Twelve have transferred and about half of the 85 who received scholarships in past years have refused to sign the new contract. The more than $ 8 million raised in last year's drive was not just for the students, but for the cost of operating the medical school for one year, Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and his son <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> said on the `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> Live'' television program in March. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayford </PERSON>, pastor of the Church on the Way in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and a member of the school's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION>, said he thought the students should be grateful for any attempt to continue the scholarships. `` A small group of med students feels there's been some kind of a breach of trust,'' <PERSON> Hayford </PERSON> said. `` In a technical sense, perhaps.'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, race-track owner whose $ 1.3 million gift pushed <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> over the $ 8 million goal just before the March 31, 1987 deadline, said the medical school was a financial failure from the start. `` They needed cash flow, and I never thought the money would be exclusively for the med students,'' he said. Regarding <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' fund-raising pitch, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said: `` I do n't approve of what's happening there, but I'm for helping education.

 American Rabbi <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON> says he's bringing a message of hope to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s tiny and isolated Jewish community, but he says he'd like to see the communist government do more for them. <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON> conducted a <LOCATION> Rosh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashana </LOCATION> service for about 200 Jews Sunday evening, as part of his two-week stay in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> for the high holidays. <PERSON> Rosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashana </PERSON> is the Jewish new year. The country's practicing Jews, estimated to number between 450 and 600, have no permanent rabbi `` They -LRB- East German Jews -RRB- are somewhat isolated,'' the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> rabbi told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I want to give them a feeling they belong to a group. I'm bringing a message of hope.'' While <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON> says he believes that `` things are loosening up,'' there is still more <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could do for Jews. `` An improvement is possible,'' the 74-year-old rabbi said in the interview in front of the Temple of Peace synagogue, the only synagogue still in use in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` There is a recognition on the part of the officials that they can do more than they have done in the past,'' <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON> said when asked about Jewish life in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Things could be better.'' He did not specify what improvements are needed. While emphasizing that part of his stay would include a `` spirit of criticism,'' he said he did not wish to become embroiled in a political dispute and said he had been well received. He is in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> under an agreement worked out between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the high holidays. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>, president of the congress, said in July that after years of pressure, there is a `` good chance'' that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would agree this fall to pay reparations to Holocaust survivors. An estimated 6 million Jews died during <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Third Reich, and until now <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has refused to pay reparations. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has agreed to restore a second <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> synagogue that has fallen into disrepair. <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON>, now a research librarian at the Jewish Theological Seminary in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was born in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and was educated in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> until 1936 when he was forced to flee by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. He served as a chaplain with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in World War II and participated in the liberation of a number of concentration camps, including <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON> said he would be `` a little sad'' to leave <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Jews, a majority of them elderly people who survived the Holocaust `` My ambition is great, but my effectiveness will be limited,'' he said, noting that Sunday's service was his first in a communist country. The World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is searching for a rabbi to serve in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on what it calls a `` long-term appointment.'' <PERSON> Dicker </PERSON> said he hopes the congress can find a such a rabbi. However, he added that finding a rabbi would be difficult. `` The person would have to be part of <PERSON> Schiller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Goethe </PERSON>, but also be horrified by <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>.''

 The pilot of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner hijacked to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1985 testified today that <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> fired the shot that killed <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sethem </PERSON>. But under questioning by defense lawyers, Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> said he did not actually see <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> pull the trigger. And he said either of the two hijackers could have led <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> to a cabin door where he was shot. `` It was my recollection that the most violent of the two men was in the companion way. I was in extreme stress and not taking notes of these details, it's only recollection,'' <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> testified he believed <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem who is on trial on charges of air piracy and murder, was the most violent of the two hijackers. The pilot said he had a chance to get a closer look at defendant during a court recess. After the break, he told the court: `` I want to make an important statement. ... I did say before that one of the two -LRB- hijackers -RRB- appeared to do more of the communicating and the other more of the violence. `` And looking at this man now, I was struck that this man fit the second of the two descriptions ... that this is the man who I recall had stood in the forward entryway and shot <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>.'' Under questioning, however, <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> said he could not recall if <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> or the other hijacker was with <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> at the time of the shooting. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has acknowledged being one of the hijackers, but denied killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, Md. If convicted, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> faces life imprisoment. Testrake, of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, was at the controls of Flight 847 when it was hijacked June 14, 1985. The flight from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> was diverted to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in 1987 after explosives were found in his luggage. His brother, <PERSON> Abdul-Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, is believed to head the <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION>, which claimed responsibility for the Jan. 17, 1987 kidnapping of <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, 55, <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> chemical company. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today, a letter attributed to <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> said the hostage expected to be freed today and linked his fate with <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. The German-language letter, which could not be authenticated, said, `` Please inform my family, but please do everything regarding <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. Please help. The hostage-takers expect something, especially now that I am freed.'' However, a statement accompanying the later and signed by the Holy Warriors for Freedom spoke of a 48-hour release period. The discrepancy could not be explained. A third <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, was convicted by a West German court in April of complicity in the kidnappings of <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and West German engineer <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> in a bid to free <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> was sentenced to 13 years in prison. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> was released a year ago in what the Holy Warriors for Freedom called a goodwill gesture. Also today, <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> described the moments after takeoff from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` About five minutes after takeoff I turned off the seatbelt light. Almost immediately after that we began to hear strange noises that came from behind the cockpit bulkhead. I asked the co-pilot to check.'' He said the co-pilot looked through a peep-hole in the cockpit door and told him: `` We have been hijacked.'' <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> said the co-pilot had seen a man brandishing `` a chrome-plated pistol.'' He said the men kicked violently at the door, breaking a panel at the bottom, then burst into the cockpit carrying the pistol and two hand grenades. <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> said he was not beaten, but that his flight engineer, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, was repeatedly struck with the pistol. `` Blood was coming from his head and from his shirt,'' <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> said. He said the hijackers beat the engineer and passengers even after the hijackers' demands to fly to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> were met. `` There was no reason for any of the beating because we were complying with their demands,'' <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> testified.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> was `` without one ounce of bigotry or prejudice'' even though he resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> because of a report that he tallied the number of Jews in a federal agency for President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in the early 1970s. Reporters shouted questions about <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>'s departure as the vice president embarked on a five-state tour including major industrial centers. He said he stood by a statement he issued Sunday, and expressed similar sentiments in a conversation with <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>. `` I know this man, and I know him to be without one ounce of bigotry or prejudice in his makeup,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, who had been deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> since Aug. 19, had admitted compiling the data in 1971 but denied Sunday he had any part in the demotion of government employees because of their religious affiliation. He said he resigned in order to keep the campaign focused on the issues. In a separate statement, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I respect <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>'s decision I know him to be a most honorable man without a trace of bigotry in his makeup ... I condemn any vestiges of anti-Semitism, prejudice or bigotry and so, I believe, does <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>.'' The Washington Post story and the resignation follow a report last week that members of an ethnic coalition for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were associated with anti-Semitic and fascistic activities. A co-chairman, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Brentar </PERSON>, resigned after disclosures he was active in the defense of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker convicted in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of being a <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp guard. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Jewish Week also reported that <PERSON> Brentar </PERSON> denied the existence of the Holocaust. `` The moral clock is ticking for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign,'' Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said Sunday, noting that Jews around the country were preparing to celebrate <PERSON> Rosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashana </PERSON>, the Jewish New Year. `` How can we trust <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be a friend of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>?'' he asked. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> business school graduate known for his management abilities, was chosen by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> late in April to run the Republican National Convention. Before the convention, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced that he would place <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> position. At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spurned Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON>'s offer to resign. The move, however, gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> greater control of the party. `` I think <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> going up there will maximize coordination between the campaign and the important functions of the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at the time. The committee voted in <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> the day after the convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had ordered <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> in 1971 to investigate what was described in notes as a `` Jewish cabal'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. At the time, <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> was <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s White House personnel chief and had been assigned to evaluate the <ORGANIZATION> BLS </ORGANIZATION> staff because <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> thought the bureau was interpreting unemployment data in an unfavorable light. On July 27, 1971, <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> reported to H.R. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s chief of staff, that 13 of 35 top <ORGANIZATION> BLS </ORGANIZATION> officials were Jewish. Post reporters found the memo last week in the archives of <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s presidency Less than two months after <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>'s memo to <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON>, two senior officials who were Jewish were moved to less visible positions in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. They were <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Henle </PERSON>, then chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> BLS </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, then director of current employment analysis. In his statement Sunday, <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said, referring to the demotion of anyone for religious reasons, `` I find that kind of action _ or even the suggestion that I engaged peripherally in that kind of effort _ to be morally wrong and totally out of bounds.'' <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, who worked as a senior executive for the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration. While with the administration in 1972, <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> oversaw a program of redirecting federal grants to benefit <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s re-election efforts.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military court began hearings today to determine whether a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain should be court-martialed for failing to rescue Vietnamese refugees who said they ate human flesh to survive at sea. Capt. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> was relieved as skipper of the USS Dubuque last month Vietnamese refugees said they resorted to murder and cannibalism after the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship refused to take them aboard in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in June. The Vietnamese eventually were rescued by fishermen and are in a refugee camp on the Philippine island of <LOCATION> Palawan </LOCATION>. Today's proceedings at <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> were a preliminary session and were adjourned for two weeks to allow <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> to prepare his defense, according to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON>. The hearing, which is the first step leading to a possible court-martial, was conducted by <PERSON> Cmdr </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Halvorson </PERSON>, a circuit military judge, <PERSON> Mukri </PERSON> said. He gave no other details. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> faces charges of `` wrongfully failing to render appropriate assistance'' to the refugees and of dereliction of duty by not properly investigating the refugees' condition. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials decided to begin proceedings against <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, 48, after he refused to appear at an admiral's mast, a closed-door session during which an admiral serves as the only judge, sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. The <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, an amphibious landing ship, was sailing toward the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on June 9 when it encountered a boat filled with Vietnamese refugees in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> gave the refugees several hundred pounds of food and water and navigational aids, but did not take them aboard because <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> judged their boat to be seaworthy. The refugees told Philippine and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> officials that after encountering the American ship, they drifted for weeks and many of them starved. Philippine and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials quoted the survivors as saying they killed and ate three of their companions after being turned away by the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>. They said they also ate two other companions who had starved. Only 52 of the 109 Vietnamese survived the 37-day crossing. They said they encountered the <ORGANIZATION> Dubuque </ORGANIZATION> 19 days after they left <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.

 Two <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombs today badly damaged the home of Sir <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloomfield </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s civil service, but <PERSON> Bloomfield </PERSON> and his family escaped serious injury. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement issued through its <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said other civil servants in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province should resign their posts. Police said two bombs exploded at about 6:15 a.m. outside the house in <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Down </LOCATION>, on the eastern outskirts of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. They said the blasts ripped gaping holes in the brickwork and shattered windows in nearby homes. <PERSON> Bloomfield </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and their son <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> were asleep in the back of the house when the bombs went off, police said. They said the family was taken to a hospital. They were released after being treated for shock. `` There was a clear intention to kill Sir <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> and anybody else in the house at the time,'' said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, who requested anonymity. `` They intended to completely blow up the house.'' A third bomb was defused by British army experts, police said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said the attack was `` yet another example of the total ruthlessness of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` This is the first time we have had a direct bomb attack on civil servants working in the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Office and it is a matter of great concern to us,'' she told reporters in <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. `` It just shows the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> are now after civilians ... They do n't mind whether the civilians have children _ they will still go and attack. British news reports said <PERSON> Bloomfield </PERSON> had no police or army guard at his home, which is 150 feet from the road 10 miles east of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. In its statement today, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> warned other civil servants involved in `` formulating British military strategy or advising the administration in this field to resign the posts or face the consequences.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bloomfield </PERSON> was `` fortunate that it was only his spoils-of-war that were damaged.'' The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province and unite it with the mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republic. Sixty-nine people have died in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> so far this year in sectarian violence.

 Scores of religious fundamentalists are heeding an author's predictions that a prelude to <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s second coming is near and some are selling their worldly goods to prepare for the end of the world. The `` Rapture'' is expected to strike before sunset Tuesday, according to the book `` 88 Reasons Why The Rapture Will Be In 1988,'' which was written by former <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> rocket engineer <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisenant </PERSON>. He used mathematical calculations and biblical interpretations to pinpoint the event to the 48 hours of this year's Jewish New Year _ 40 years and 120 days after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> became a nation on May 14, 1948. According to his book, millions of the faithful will be suddenly, silently called to Heaven this week and global disasters will follow. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, a minister reported a baptism boom and in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> a retired firefighter spent $ 3,700 for a newspaper ad to tell people that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> will return this week to take believers to heaven. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koval </PERSON> said the cost of the ad in The Blade of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> was `` a pittance, because if this is true and it does come to pass, what's money anyway? Most religious leaders say there is no evidence to support claims that the Rapture will occur this week. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said the Rapture appeals mainly to fundamentalist Christians who interpret the Bible as the literal word of God. `` It's just a sign of the times _ people are looking for reassurance that it's going to happen,'' said Dr. E.S. <PERSON> Hanrahan </PERSON>, dean of the College of Science at <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. Rabbi <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Urecki </PERSON> of B'Nai <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, a Conservative Jewish synagogue in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said he was being swamped with calls from Christians as <PERSON> Rosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashana </PERSON> neared `` I've been telling people who call that I'll see them Tuesday,'' he said. `` I'm not too worried about it.'' But some Christians are taking it seriously and are selling off their valuables in anticipation that they will soon be in the Kingdom of God. <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, television station <ORGANIZATION> WTVD </ORGANIZATION> reported that several residents last week put their cars and a boat up for sale in anticipation of the event. Many preachers talked about the Rapture in their Sunday sermons. `` Will it happen? I'm not a date-setter ... but I'm not a fool, either,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Allman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, who urged worshippers to `` check out their priorities.'' <PERSON> Allman </PERSON>, pastor of Peoples Memorial, said the event had created a revival at his church, with attendance doubling in recent weeks to more than 700 at Sunday and 350 at weeknight services. `` This has made them -LRB- people -RRB- understand that in a flash this could all be over,'' he said. `` The Lord is coming back. I'm looking at it about any time now,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> McLamb </PERSON>, 37, of Coats, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today named a bipartisan, 13-member campaign panel to advise him on national security issues, and both immediately accused Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of lacking the capacity to handle world crises. One panelist, <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, former national security adviser to Democratic President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, said that of the two current presidential candidates, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the one who can best fashion an effective, bipartisan foreign policy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would question the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's direct initiatives in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and rely instead on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> or other international organizations `` We can not abdicate our responsibility for leadership,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, who was President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s national security adviser, said the Democratic nominee `` has demonstrated neither the capacity nor the instincts'' to handle world crises. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the 13 panelists will provide him with `` sound advice and counsel'' in his campaign for the White House.

 More than 100,000 people cheered a parade of beauty queens, movie stars and floats through seven miles of city streets to mark <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s struggle for independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` This holiday is to Mexicans what the Fourth of July is to Americans,'' <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Arellano </PERSON>, who moved to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> more than 50 years ago, said Sunday. `` Grito de Dolores'' marks <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hidalgo </PERSON> y Costilla's impassioned speech in 1810 urging his peasant congregation in the city of <LOCATION> Dolores </LOCATION> to take up arms against <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> monarchs who had ruled <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for more than three centuries By 1821, the Mexicans had won their independence. <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 74, whose parents immigrated from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1921, has organized the parade for the past 25 years and has attended twice as many. `` When the parade was first organized, it was nothing but a bunch of brewing companies that put a couple of <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> flags on their trucks and drove down <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION>, but as the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> population here increases, the parade gets bigger and bigger,'' he said.

The parade featured Indian dancers in glistening silver and gold robes with anklets of dried nuts that could be heard rattling above the sound of the trumpets and guitars of mariachis. Men thrust their fists in the air and shouted `` Viva la Independencia'' as military bands marched by and fans swooned over the singing group Menudo and such Mexican movie stars as Parade Grand Marshal <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Iniquez </PERSON>. Mexican beauty queens smiled at the crowd from colorful, 30-foot floats.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destroyer rescued three shipwrecked fishermen and was searching for a fourth after their two small craft foundered in rough seas in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, American naval sources said today. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official said the destroyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> had just finished escorting two U.S.-chartered cargo vessels out of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> when its patrol helicopter spotted the fishermen clinging to pieces of wreckage. The fishermen were two Pakistanis and a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> citizen, all from the Emirates port of Fujairah. The three men were quoted as saying one of their craft was swamped in the heavy seas and the second sank after trying to come to its rescue. The missing man was another Emirates citizen, said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official, who asked not to be identified. The 7,800-ton <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, based at <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, is one of five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships scheduled to leave the gulf within the next two weeks. All will be replaced by ships now on their way to the gulf. It was the second reported rescue of fishermen by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship in the past month. In August, the missile cruiser <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> picked up eight Iranians who had been adrift for eight days in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. They later were repatriated. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, which on July 3 mistakenly shot down an Iranian jetliner, killing all 290 aboard, left the gulf region Sunday for its home port of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a week after it was originally scheduled to leave, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. The departure of the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> represents the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force reduction in the gulf _ from 27 to 26 warships _ since the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> cease-fire took effect Aug. 20. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sources confirmed that there were no plans to replace the 9,600-ton Aegis cruiser. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sources, who demanded anonymity, said the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was ordered to delay its departure after an Arab gulf country objected to the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> being pulled out while the Iran-Iraq cease-fire talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> remained stalled. The sources declined to identify the Arab government or say why the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was leaving now. The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks have continued to show no significant progress. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was being withdrawn because its long-range radar and weapons capability `` is no longer needed there.'' As the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Navy-escorted tanker convoy reached <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> overnight, that country's top tanker official said the cease-fire in the 8-year-old war does not mean an end to its reliance on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other foreign flags to protect its ships. `` Kuwaiti tankers will continue to sail under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Soviet and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> flags. The reflagging is a purely economic policy and has nothing to do with the war,'' <PERSON> Abdel-Fattah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Bader </PERSON>, chairman of the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as saying in an interview with the newspaper Al-Watan. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have all reflagged vessels and protected Kuwaiti shipping from Iranian attack in the gulf during the past year. One of the 11 U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers, the 46,723-ton carrier <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Princess </ORGANIZATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> overnight, escorted by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile frigate <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>. It was the 63rd such convoy this year and the 85th since the reflagging began in July 1987.

 A gun battle at a wake left two men dead and three others wounded, authorities said. `` Both may have been shot by each other, although the possibility of another gunman does exist,'' police said in a statement. No other suspects had been identified or arrested. Authorities are investigating the possibility that the men, both Albanian-Americans, were killed by two or three suspects, police Sgt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Misak </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Gojcha </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicha </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> were pronounced dead at <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Receiving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> after the shootings Sunday outside the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> enclave, police said.

<TEXT>
 A wind-whipped fire that destroyed 13 homes and burned pleasure boats on a lake forced residents of this affluent Gold Rush country town to evacuate a second time today. The fire was fanned by 30 mph gusts and fueled by drought-dry <PERSON> bush </PERSON>, wood roofs and propane tanks which exploded like small bombs, said state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakobs </PERSON>. Flames destroyed 20 to 30 structures, including 13 homes. `` The fire laid down a little during the night but picked up this morning,'' he said of the blaze in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> foothills. More than 1,220 federal, state and local firefighters were on the fire lines today in one of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s most scenic and historic areas, <PERSON> Jakobs </PERSON> said. Residents of this mountain town of 4,500 people 45 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> and the tiny town of Rough and Ready were evacuated Sunday, and Highway 49 was closed. They were allowed to begin returning home this morning, but were ordered evacuated again later. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials declared a state of emergency, initiating a process to make the county eligible for more state and federal assistance. Most schools in the area were closed. Thick smoke made it unsafe to operate school buses and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> needed some schools for evacuation centers. A firefighter suffered minor hand burns when flames engulfed his bulldozer, forcing him to wrap himself in an asbestos blanket and take refuge under his vehicle. Meanwhile, a new fire broke out less than a half mile from the main blaze and burned 700 acres by early today, said <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. She estimated the overall acreage at 12,000. The main fire, which began Sunday morning along Highway 49 about 30 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was apparently caused by an illegal burn of debris, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Dow </PERSON>. Before their evacuation, weary, soot-smeared homeowners used chain saws and hoses in an effort to keep the fire from spreading. `` We're ready to leave if we have to, but until then we'll stay and help out,'' resident <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hultquist </PERSON>, 41, said Sunday night as he helped hose down a neighbor's burning house. `` Everything you got could go up in flames.'' Some made sure families and animals were safe, then returned to battle the blaze after nightfall as hot spots glowed in the hills. `` Nobody expected it to come in fast like this,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, 38, said as he cut down a large, smoldering tree in his yard. He looked sadly at a neighbor's house that had caught fire and burned as flames hopscotched through the area. `` God, what a heartache. It was n't that nice a house. It was just a house, but it was their home,'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said. Firefighter <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, 31, suffered hand burns after fire swept over his bulldozer. `` I thought I was done for more than once,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. `` It feels good to be alive.'' The fire burned southwest, straddling Highway 29 and crossing the South Fork of the <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. When it reached <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wildwood </LOCATION>, it skipped through the community, burning yards and oak trees between large houses, some valued at $ 1 million. In some places, flames reached the lake, igniting marina railings, several boats and a dock or platform in the water. `` It's scary. It started a long ways away but came in in a snap,'' said <PERSON> Hultquist </PERSON>, snapping his fingers. Many homes on the north side of the lake were saved, partly because firefighters or residents hosed them down. Some of the fleeing homeowners, who formed a slow, five-mile-long line of traffic out of the area, left sprinklers running in yards or on roofs. Evacuees were taken to several schools and other temporary shelters in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Grass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, both about 10 miles east of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wildwood </LOCATION>. Pets and livestock were transported to the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fairgrounds </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alford </PERSON> said. Firefighters on Sunday were hampered by steep terrain, temperatures in the upper 80s and 40-mph gusts. `` The wind is our biggest enemy out here today,'' <PERSON> Jakobs </PERSON> said. `` We had a solid front of fire about a half-mile long moving at a rapid rate through dense brush and timber.'' The wind drove smoke and ash into downtown <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. The fire also knocked out power to about 10,000 customers, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised a foreign policy today that would `` restore respect for American leadership in a changing world'' and declared that Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had failed in combating trade deficits, terrorism and drug trafficking. The Democratic nominee began a three-day campaign trip focusing on national security, defense and foreign affairs _ three areas in which he has vulnerable to attack by his Republican rival. His aides said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned to deal with U.S.-Soviet relations in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Tuesday and with military policy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday. In a speech today at a union hall in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said his three key points would be a strong domestic economy that would bolster the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position in world trade, unwavering opposition to terrorism and an expanded effort to halt international drug trafficking. `` In each of these three areas, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has failed,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in prepared remarks. `` I want to beat our foreign competitors; he's willing to settle for second best. I want to crack down on terrorism; he knuckled under to the Ayatollah. I want a real war on drugs; his answer to drug kingpins like <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in a long list of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies, ranging from the Iran-Contra affair to cutbacks in federal funds for state and local drug programs and support for Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader who is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment for alleged drug trafficking. `` Why have n't you explained to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, to our parents and children, to our law enforcement officers and to victims of drug-related crimes, why the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government had General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on its payroll?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked. `` What kind of judgment is this?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked. `` What kind of priorities are these? What kind of strategy for restoring respect for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and protecting our national security can we expect from Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. My friends, we need answers, and we need better leadership from the next president than we are going to get from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' He accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of `` yielding control of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economic future to bankers in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>.'' He promised to enforce the new trade law, encourage better labor-management relations and help business invest in new technology and research. `` The primary foreign policy objective of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration can be stated very simply: to restore respect for American leadership in a changing world,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He promised a strong military, a growing economy and `` strong and decisive leadership that understands and knows how to cope with change.'' From <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was heading to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to visit a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> which builds jet engines for the Stealth bomber, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supports. The three states on the governor's current campaign swing account for 72 electoral college votes, or more than a quarter of the 270 votes needed to elect the next president. During the weekend, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met with Democratic congressional experts on defense matters to prepare for his trip. After their Sunday meeting, they criticized President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for vetoing a defense spending bill that won broad, bipartisan support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and had the backing of several administration officials. `` What you see here is an example of the way we're going to make national security policy beginning in January 1989,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` With a president and a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that work together.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the congressmen accused <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of vetoing the bill to give <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fodder for his attempts to characterize <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as naive on defense issues. `` The vice president's political team said let's play political football with the nation's defense,'' said former presidential candidate Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. `` I think it's outrageous. Among those at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' side were Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION>, respectively. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> and several others at the meeting agreed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been successful in painting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as weak on defense but said they expected the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee to counter those efforts successfully this week.

 Shivering firefighters rejoiced as snow eased their battle against blazes that have blackened more than 1 million acres, but a forecast for warm, dry weather kept them on guard. `` I just love it. It means we might get to go home earlier,'' firefighter <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said Sunday as snow dusted much of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>. Three to 4 inches fell in areas south of <LOCATION> Mammoth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. Humidity was as high as 90 percent, and temperatures in the mid-30s combined with winds of up to 30 mph for a wind chill index of 19 degrees. `` Things for the short term are better here,'' park spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON> said. `` We're more optimistic this morning than we have been for some weeks,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Baden </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> director at the <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, in an interview today on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> `` This Morning.'' The center coordinates forest fire fighting nationwide. In the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> foothills of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a wind-whipped fire that began Sunday charred 12,000 acres of brush and timber, destroyed 13 homes and seven to 17 other structures, and forced residents of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wildwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a town of 4,500, to evacuate today for a second time. About 1,200 firefighters fought the blaze today in the historic Gold Rush country, said <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakobs </PERSON>. At one point, flames engulfed a bulldozer, forcing its operator to wrap himself in an asbestos blanket and take refuge under his vehicle. He suffered minor burns. Light snow and low temperatures also helped firefighters in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, and rain and cooler weather slowed fires in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. In northwest <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, officials closed millions of acres of state-protected forests in an effort to curb the number of fires caused by human carelessness. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, crews took advantage of the cool weather to carve lines around a forest fire north of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and another that has scorched more than 30,000 acres in and around Glacier National Park near the Canadian border. At Glacier, two firefighters were injured when a tree fell across the back of an open truck carrying crews to a 30,400-acre fire, officials said. At <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, the light snow had firefighters shivering around propane heaters Sunday night. Fire managers joked thatfears before the weekend of another `` Black Saturday'' _ when fires on Saturday, Aug. 20, sent blazes roaring across 150,000 acres _ melted when `` White Sunday'' arrived. Firefighters were pulled off the lines Sunday when the chill set in. `` Our hoses were freezing up as fast as we put them out,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a fire crew chief from <LOCATION> Bushnell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Today's forecast was almost as good as Sunday's weather: a chance of rain or snow, temperatures no higher than the 50s and light winds But by Tuesday, a drying trend is expected, with temperatures climbing back into the 60s and 70s. `` In five or six days we could be back in a more severe weather situation,'' <PERSON> Baden </PERSON> said. Firefighters took advantage of Sunday's good weather to shore up their defenses against the wildfires, which have blackened about 900,000 of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s 2.2 million acres since June in what firefighters call the worst fire season in the West in 30 years. The weather allowed park officials to reopen the west entrance and the road from there to <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Faithful </LOCATION> and Madison Junction north of the famed geyser. The rest of the park remained closed to visitors. Residents of park headquarters at Mammoth were allowed to return home, but were told to be ready for another evacuation if flames from a 263,400-acre fire threatens the area again. A 328,100-acre fire in the park's northeast quadrant expanded significantly, combining with an 87,500-acre fire. But weather conditions helped firefighting crews, enabling them to attack the blaze directly. Lower temperatures raise humidity, and the moisture is soaked up by tinder-dry trees, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Halliday </PERSON>, chief naturalist for <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s west district. The wood will `` be less likely to burn, although the fire should n't have much trouble,'' <PERSON> Halliday </PERSON> said. `` Basically with this cold front that's moved in, it's going to put us kind of in a holding pattern,'' said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON>. Cabinet officials, who toured <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> over the weekend on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s orders, said the fires must be extinguished, and said the policy of letting naturally ignited wildfires in national parks and wilderness areas burn unless they threaten property or people has n't worked. `` The most important thing is to concentrate our efforts on getting these fires under control and then out,'' <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, which coordinates Western firefighting efforts. `` The old policy has to be reviewed and altered,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. `` Nobody who has seen it operate this year could say it was a success.'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> was accompanied by Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> and Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> IV. <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said two Marine battalions _ 1,200 men _ from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and two additional Army battalions would be sent to help fight fires. About 2,300 Army soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, have already been dispatched.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> preached peace and reconciliation Monday during an open-air Mass in <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION>, a province where tribal warfare ended only four months ago. `` No more training for war,'' the 68-year-old pontiff told 50,000 people at Ascot horse track in <LOCATION> Bulawayo </LOCATION>, the provincial capital. `` Hammer swords into plowshares, spears into sickles and nation will not lift sword against nation,'' he said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who is on the first leg of a five-nation, 10-day pilgrimage to southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, flew to <LOCATION> Bulawayo </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>. He was welcomed at the track by bishops in cassocks and African drummers, dancers and singers dressed in animal skins. The pope was met at <LOCATION> Bulawayo </LOCATION>'s heavily guarded airport by <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON>, former rival of President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> and now a senior minister in the socialist government. In December, <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> signed an accord that merged their feuding political parties. As a result, nearly eight years of fighting between armed dissidents loyal to <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> and government troops in <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> ended in May. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> _ speaking in English, Latin and the two main African languages of the <LOCATION> Shona </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ndebele </PERSON> tribes _ lamented that the minority <LOCATION> Ndebele </LOCATION> people of <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> did not find peace after independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> April 18, 1980. But he prayed that their newfound peace and reconciliation would hold. `` It is only eight years since your struggle for national independence was brought to an end,'' the pontiff said from a red-carpeted rostrum festooned with lilies. `` Even after that, many people in <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> did not find true peace ... the civilian population continued to suffer from guerrilla warfare and other forms of violence.'' Before the Mass, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was introduced by Swiss-born Matabeleland Bishop <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlen </PERSON> who in 1984 accused troops of committing atrocities against the Ndebele, traditional foes of <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s dominant <PERSON> Shona </PERSON> tribe. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Karlen </PERSON> at the time for fabricating the charge and siding with terrorists. Among hundreds of civilians slain in the conflict were 10 <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> missionaries, one of whom was killed on April 19 just hours after <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> announced a general amnesty for rebels as part of the accord. `` The people of <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> have suffered much during the liberation war,'' <PERSON> Karlen </PERSON> said, referring to the seven-year guerrilla war led by separate armies under <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> against white minority rule. <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> continued to suffer after independence through drought and violence, he added. `` The blood of 10 missionary martyrs of the diocese of <LOCATION> Bulawayo </LOCATION> has flowed into the soil,'' <PERSON> Karlen </PERSON> said. `` May this blood bear abundant fruit.'' The pope's visit to <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> came four months after 113 dissidents left their bush hideouts under the amnesty, and there have been no reports of rebel-related violence since then. Under the accord, <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, made up of the <LOCATION> Ndebele </LOCATION> tribe, and <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, backed by the <LOCATION> Shona </LOCATION> people, will formally merge under one banner as a prelude to establishing a one-party state in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> will leave <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> on Tuesday for neighboring <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, the next stop on his pilgrimage through black-ruled states neighboring racially troubled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Before returning to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, the pope will also visit <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> before returning to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>.

 Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, packing 110 mph winds and torrential rain, moved over this capital city today after skirting <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Telephone communications were affected. `` Right now it's actually moving over <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` We've already had reports of 110 mph winds on the eastern tip `` It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that island, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerful hurricane,'' Sheets said. Forecasters say <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was expected to lash <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> throughout the day and was on track to later strike the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, a small British dependency northwest of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Havana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported today that 25,000 people were evacuated from <LOCATION> Guantanamo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s southeastern coast as strong winds fanning out from <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> began brushing the island. All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, while flights from <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION>, the main island of the three-island chain, arrived packed with frightened travelers. `` People were running around in the main lobby of our hotel -LRB- on <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> -RRB- like chickens with their heads cut off,'' said one vacationer who was returning home to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Hurricane warnings were posted for the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. Warnings were discontinued for the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. `` All interests in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> should continue to monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane,'' the service said, adding, `` Little change in strength is expected for the next several hours as the hurricane moves westward over <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>' Caribbean headquarters in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, was unable to get phone calls through to <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, where high winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched the capital overnight, toppling trees, causing local flooding and littering streets with branches. Most Jamaicans stayed home, boarding up windows in preparation for the hurricane. Some companies broadcast appeals for technicians and electricians to report to work. The weather bureau predicted <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s center, 140 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> before dawn, would pass south of <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> and hit the southern parish of <LOCATION> Clarendon </LOCATION>. Flash flood warnings were issued for the parishes of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> on the northeast and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> on the north. The north coast tourist region from <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on the west and <PERSON> Ocho </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> on the east, far from the southern impact zone and separated by mountains, was expected only to receive heavy rain. Officials urged residents in the higher risk areas along the south coast to seek higher ground. `` It's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> for a long time,'' said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerrish </PERSON>, forecaster at the National Hurricane Center. Forecasters at the center said the eye of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was 140 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> at dawn today. Maximum sustained winds were near 110 mph, with tropical-storm force winds extending up to 250 miles to the north and 100 miles to the south. Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> alerted all government agencies, saying Sunday night: `` Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> appears to be a real threat and everyone should follow the instructions and hurricane precautions issued by the Office of Disaster Preparedness in order to minimize the danger.'' Forecasters said the hurricane had been gaining strength as it passed over the ocean after it dumped 5 to 10 inches of rain on the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, which share the island of <LOCATION> Hispaniola </LOCATION>. `` We should know within about 72 hours whether it's going to be a major threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, another meteorologist at the center. `` It's moving at about 17 mph to the west and normally hurricanes take a northward turn after they pass central <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> news agency said a state of alert was declared at midday in the Cuban provinces of <LOCATION> Guantanamo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Holguin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Granma </ORGANIZATION>. In the report from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> received in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prensa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Latina </LOCATION> said civil defense officials were broadcasting bulletins on national radio and television recommending emergency measures and providing information on the storm. Heavy rain and stiff winds downed power lines and caused flooding in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> on Sunday night as the hurricane's center passed just south of the <LOCATION> Barahona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, then less than 100 miles from neighboring <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. The storm ripped the roofs off houses and flooded coastal areas of southwestern <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> after reaching hurricane strength off the island's southeast Saturday night. Flights were canceled Sunday in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, where civil defense director <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabral </PERSON> reported some flooding in parts of the capital of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION> and power outages there and in other southern areas.

<HEAD>Bangladesh Calls For More Aid, Battles Diarrhea Epidemic</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The president of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> appealed Monday for more foreign aid to feed more than 40 million people left homeless by the flood, and doctors tried to halt an epidemic of diarrhea. More than 250,000 people were suffering from diarrhea, the health center said, with nearly 36,000 new cases reported in the last 24 hours. Many got the disease by drinking water contaminated by raw sewage and flood waters. A senior doctor who declined to be identified said about 5 percent of the diarrhea patients have contracted cholera. President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said the $ 280 million in aid so far promised to his country was not enough even to rebuild roads washed away by flood waters that cover three-fourths of the country. He said it was too early to estimate the total amount of funds needed. `` For centuries the people of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> have lived with floods, but never before have the rivers unleashed such fury on her people,'' the 59-year-old former army general told a news conference. The government puts the official death toll at 881 from the floods, which started June 13 and reached new heights in late August. The health control center said 138 deaths were from diarrhea, while the others were caused by drownings, houses collapsing and snake bites. Daily tallies in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers, however, put the death toll at 1,647, without giving a breakdown by category. A substantial amount of emergency flood relief arrived Monday in a giant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military cargo plane. The C-5a Galaxy contained water purification units, water storage tanks and 10,000 five-gallon water containers. The plane also brought the deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid director, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, and doctors from the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, water purification specialists, and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> transport and logistics specialists. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diarrheal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, funded primarily by foreign aid, said it had admitted 550 patients with diarrhea in the past 24 hours, compared with an average of 155 patients a day last month. The senior doctor who reported the cholera problem said it was typical that 5 percent of the diarrhea cases would turn out to be cholera. <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers also have reported isolated cholera cases from people drinking flood-polluted water. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and later was elected to the presidency in what his opponents called a rigged vote, said there are only 8,000 doctors in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, a nation of 110 million people. He said 30 million to 40 million people were marooned by the flood or in need of help. He also said the flood had destroyed or damaged 8 million houses. Since the average size of a family in <LOCATION> Banglasesh </LOCATION> is six people, that would appear to mean that 48 million are homeless, up from the 25 million reported previously. The flood control center said major rivers were receding Monday in the north and west but rising slightly in the south as flood waters approached the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which enters <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, fell by three-fourths of an inch at the western monitoring station of Gualnanda but remained 19 inches above flood level. At the southern monitoring station of <LOCATION> Bhagakul </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION> rose one-third of an inch to about 30 inches above flood stage. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said 53 of the country's 64 districts have been affected by the flood. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pledged about $ 154 million worth of aid to <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> for flood relief, but a large portion of this was already in the pipeline to <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and is being released early. For example, the allocation of aid included $ 60 million in food grains already planned for release in the coming 12 months. Embassy officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to say how much of the $ 154 million of aid was actually new. Before the flood, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had allotted about $ 131 million worth of aid to <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, which is one of the world's largest aid recipients Aid promised to <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> by foreign donors before the flood stood at $ 2 billion for the current year.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declared today that `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has failed'' in three critical foreign policy tests, while Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took a new shot at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on military policy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also defended <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, his adviser who abruptly left a top <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> post Sunday after a news story saying he counted the number of Jews in a federal agency for then-President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1971. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said the three key points of his national security policy would be a solid domestic economy making the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> strong in international trade, unwavering opposition to terrorism and a stepped-up effort to halt international drug trafficking. `` In each of these three areas, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has failed,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a crowd of about 250 people in a union hall. `` I want to beat our foreign competitors; he's willing to settle for second best. I want to crack down on terrorism; he knuckled under to the ayatollah. I want a real war on drugs; his answer to drug kingpins like <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' General <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the Panamanian leader charged in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal court with drug violations. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential running mate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would lean on international organizations too much rather than take action as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration did in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, in attacking <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and in escorting ships through the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` We can not abdicate our responsibility for leadership,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before leaving on a campaign trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. At a street rally in the heavily <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where he was preceded by salsa music and chants of `` <PERSON> Viva </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' the vice president declared that `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has economic power and I'm not going to let them take it away from you.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was introduced by Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, who struck an emotional nerve among the Cuban exiles when he said that `` every time a dictatorship has threatened democracy, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> bush </PERSON> has been there.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also named a 13-member national security panel, including former secretaries of state <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> as well as <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, who was former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s national security adviser <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON> said he was proud to have served <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, a Democrat, but of the two current presidential candidates Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` is the one who can best fashion an effective bipartisan foreign policy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked by reporters about <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, who resigned as deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> after a report Sunday in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that he compiled figures on the number of Jews in high-ranking positions in the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration. `` I know this man and I know him to be without one ounce of bigotry or prejudice in his makeup,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Notes that are part of the presidential archives refer to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s search for a `` Jewish cabal'' that he thought was using unemployment data to put him in an unfavorable light. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> acknowledged compiling the figures, but said he thought <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s notions were `` nonsense,'' and that he had nothing to do with subsequent demotion of two Jewish officials in the bureau The report was the second in a week suggesting that people connected with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign engaged in activities that were either overtly anti-Semitic or could be construed that way. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s personnel chief at the time, issued a statement with the announcement of his resignation Sunday saying he did n't want publicity about his actions for <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> to jeopardize the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. The resignation deprives <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at least temporarily, of direct control over the national party during the fall campaign. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>'s resignation followed the departure last week of <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Brentar </PERSON> as co-chairman of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign organization for ethnic groups. <PERSON> Brentar </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> travel agent, had been an active defender of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, who was extradited and convicted in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of being a Nazi war criminal. Last week, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Jewish Week newspaper reported that <PERSON> Brentar </PERSON> was active in groups that denied the existence of the Holocaust and that he had made anti-Semitic statements. The report named several members of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ethnic coalition who had ties to fascistic and anti-Semitic groups. `` What at first seemed to be a few unsettling errors in judgment in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign now seems to be growing into a pattern of astonishing insensitivity that is totally inappropriate for an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidential campaign,'' Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said Sunday in a statement. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has taken a more aggressive stance in recent days, spoke Sunday with congressional leaders in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> about his image on national security and foreign policy issues and promised to `` restate my positions forcefully'' this week. Among the nearly dozen members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who attended the meeting were Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s counterpart in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and former presidential candidate Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> acknowledged after the meeting that he had some differences with leading defense spokesmen of his party, most of whom are more hard-line, but promised a consensus-oriented approach to setting Pentagon priorities. `` What you see here is an example of the way we're going to make national security policy beginning in January 1989,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` With a president and a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that work together.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has undergone repeated criticism from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, which claims he seeks `` unilateral disarmament.'' And last week <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared to change his position on <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, which he previously described as a fantasy, by saying he would support research on the space-based defense program.

<HEAD>China Completes Multi-Candidate Elections of Provincial Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has completed its first multi-candidate elections of provincial leaders, the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The authoritative weekly said the elections, which wound up in August, `` marked a new step forward for democracy'' in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where formerly there was only one candidate for each seat chosen by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. It said that of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 29 provinces and autonomous regions, the governors of eight and the chairmen of 11 provincial people's congresses were chosen in multi-candidate votes Deputy governors and vice-chairmen in 28 regions faced competition, it said. Under a 1986 law, there should be more than one candidate for provincial-level offices and each candidate must be nominated by at least 10 deputies to the provincial congress, or legislature. Final voting is done by the deputies. Ordinary citizens can vote directly only for officials at the township and county level. The weekly said the number of candidates nominated to the provincial posts was 24 percent greater than the vacant positions. `` With the break from the outmoded convention that a candidate, once nominated, would definitely be elected, the notion that officials can only get promotions but never demotions was pushed aside,'' it said. The report also said the elections, held ever five years, increased from 18 to 26 percent those governors and deputy governors under the age of 50. College graduates increased from 69 percent to 74 percent. In people's congresses, chairmen and vice-chairmen under 60 years rose from 8 percent to 30 percent.

Autopsies were scheduled, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Gabe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said. An unidentified man about 38 years old was shot with a <ORGANIZATION> Taser </ORGANIZATION> dart after a struggle with Bell-Cudahy police Sunday, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said. The unidentified man, believed to be under the influence of drugs, became violent and began fighting with officers. `` During the altercation, a <ORGANIZATION> Taser </ORGANIZATION> was used to subdue him,'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said. The man was pronounced dead at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lynwood </LOCATION>. In the other incident, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, 37, was found standing nude Sunday at an intersection in <LOCATION> Paramount </LOCATION>, 12 miles south of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` When the sheriff's department stopped to investigate, he became combative and a violent struggle began,'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said.

 A former janitor has fought for nearly nine years since his acquittal on rape charges to get his old job back at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> and to get a speedy resolution of his case in state courts. `` The guy's going to be dead and buried by the time this is resolved,'' attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 62, was fired from his janitor's job on Aug. 10, 1979, after a woman charged that he raped her two months earlier. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who had no criminal record, was acquitted in December 1979, but he was not given his job back even though he had worked at the university for 14 years. He sued, charging his firing was unjustified. He also filed a complaint with the city Human Relations Commission charging the university with race discrimination. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> is black. A Common Pleas Court jury in 1982 ordered <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s reinstatement and awarded him nearly $ 125,000 After the university appealed, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> settled the case in 1985 for $ 15,000 and attorney's fees. Meanwhile, the city <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ordered <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s reinstatement with back pay in March 1984. The university appealed that decision, too, but <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pleas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> officials apparently lost <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s file, delaying a trial until December 1987, when Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> affirmed the commission's ruling. The university appealed again, to <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, on Jan. 8. <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> officials failed to get <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> to forward <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s files until last Friday, when a judge from that court ordered <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> to send the information. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Prorok </PERSON>, attorney for the university, said the case has been appealed because there was no racial discrimination against <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` The university's basis for discharging -LRB- <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> -RRB- was an investigation that, in their judgment, concluded that he committed the rape. We sincerely believe that race had absolutely nothing to do with his dismissal,'' he said. `` The fact that someone is acquitted in a criminal case does n't necessarily mean he did n't commit the crime,'' <PERSON> Prorok </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s wife, <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, said her husband has n't worked since 1979. He said the family has lived on Social Security, welfare, a small pension and a newspaper route. `` I believe God in his own time will clear this up,'' she said. `` But it looks as if somebody somewhere came between us and the Lord.''

 Rumors of devil worship and child abduction have spread like wildfire across a large section of eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, stumping police who have fielded thousands of telephone calls from terrified residents. `` This is the first time to my knowledge that a rumor of this nature has gotten to this proportion,'' said <PERSON> Elijah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollon </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputy. `` This one seems like it's carrying on much more than anything I've ever seen before.'' `` It got wild here,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> said. `` You could have brought a bunch of guns in here and made a fortune.'' He said he understood that one department store had sold out of guns. A survey of sheriff's offices, police departments and <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> posts found satanic rumors have spread into at least 25 eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> counties since late July. In most cases, the rumors hold that Satan worshipers are looking for blond, blue-eyed children to kill in a sacrifice to the devil. Some versions say the satanic followers must round up several children to sacrifice before Halloween. All the law enforcement officials surveyed last week said they believed the stories were false. Most agencies reported investigating and finding no supporting evidence. <PERSON> Hollon </PERSON> and other officers said they believed the stories started in <LOCATION> Breathitt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where a grave robbery was discovered July 18. Two juveniles and four adults were charged in connection with the grave desecration. <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, who also is <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s police chief, said officers found a pentacle or five-pointed star on the floor of a mobile home the defendants are alleged to have used for satanic ceremonies. The words `` Satan Rules'' were inscribed outside a circle around the star symbol, he said. At each point of the star, officers discovered a drop of what was believed to be blood, <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> said. Videotapes and books on the occult were confiscated from the trailer on Aug. 15, he said. Many residents wrongly believed that police were withholding information about the grave robbery and possible satanic connections, <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> said. `` At first we could n't even calm people down,'' he said. `` Until we got the trailer, we could n't come right out and say they were devil worshiping.''

 A long-lost sketch in pen and ink owned by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> has been placed in the first president's <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vernon </ORGANIZATION> estate after a man found it among the belongings of an elderly neighbor <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Norback </PERSON>, 85, a former appliance salesman, said in 1975 he noticed an old sketch in a neighbor's home in <LOCATION> Killingworth </LOCATION>, which is 20 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>. The sketch, about 20 by 16 inches, is of a huge stone prison being demolished. The neighbor, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Carswell </PERSON>, acquired the sketch about 40 years earlier from a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, warehouse, <LOCATION> Norwell </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Norback </PERSON> said <PERSON> Carswell </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, showed him a 1958 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> clipping that included a photograph of the sketch. The caption said the sketch was entitled, `` Destruction of the Bastille,'' and explained that it was a gift from <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Auctioneer </PERSON> <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherman </PERSON> decided not to sell off one item he discovered at a farm near this northwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> town: a World War II bomb used as a farmhouse doorstop. <PERSON> Scherman </PERSON>, an auctioneer, came across the 2-foot-long brass projectile as he was conducting inventory for an estate auction at the farm.

<TEXT>
 Leaders of a black boycott of the district's 17 public schools urged teachers in the school system to call in sick Monday, but a school official said teacher attendance was normal. The boycott was called to pressure officials to oust school superintendent <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON> and his assistant, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweatt </PERSON>, both of whom are white. Protesters say the two are not sensitive to the needs of the mostly black school district. `` From 1869 they've had a white -LRB- superintendent -RRB-,'' said protest leader <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, education chairman of the group, Save Our Children. `` We ask for one black person, and we're racist.'' <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sweatt </PERSON> have declined to comment on the boycott. `` From what I gathered, it is a normal day for absences on the part of teachers,'' Assistant Superintendent <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON> said Monday. Some parents also have been holding their children out of class in protest. For two days last week, almost one-third of the district's students were absent from classes. <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON> said 5,564 students were in attendance Monday. Before the boycott began, attendance was 8,834 in the district's 17 public school Thursday, 5,879 students attended, and 6,082 attended Friday. About 200 people marched Saturday through the downtown area in support of the boycott. Police escorted marchers for about a mile through the downtown as they sang `` We Shall Overcome'' and carried banners calling for the superintendent's ouster.

 A small earthquake centered offshore near metropolitan <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> awakened residents early Monday, but there were no reports of damage or injury, authorities said.

 Processors handling the alligators killed in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s first gator season in two decades say they are working overtime to keep up with successful hunters. `` We've been working until 2 or 3 in the morning every night,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON>, who runs one of 29 facilities in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> that skin and butcher alligators. `` They're stacking up like cordwood.'' Less than halfway through the monthlong hunt, which began Sept. 1 and was authorized because of the proliferation of the alligators, several hunters are near the quota of 15 each. The hunt is monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, but the 238 licensed hunters are not required to file records until two weeks after the hunt ends. `` We wo n't know anything about numbers until after the harvest,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, public information specialist with the commission. `` We kept a tally the first day, and we counted at least 131 gators.'' If each hunter bags the quota, 3,450 alligators will be killed. The commission has estimated about 2,600 alligators would be killed. `` We've been going literally 24 hours a day,'' said G.O. Parrot, a processor near <LOCATION> Bushnell </LOCATION>. `` We've probably done about 50 or 60 since the season started.'' `` It takes us about an hour a foot and we've done 200 feet of gator and boxed 750 pounds of meat,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Holdridge </PERSON>, the chief processor at Hooks Alligator Product in <PERSON> Davie </PERSON>. `` If every hunter gets their quota, we will be up to our eyes in gator.'' A licensed processor will sometimes buy the whole alligator for $ 30 to $ 50 a foot. Other hunters pay a processing fee and get back the meat and hide.

 Actress <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> says the problems facing Americans should not be blamed on men or women but on the fact that the family unit has become `` disposable.'' `` I think that it's not only what's wrong with men.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> stock analyst who began giving gifts to his Ozark hometown almost two years ago with the donation of a $ 3 million trust has delivered another bonanza. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Delarue </PERSON> last week gave Bolivar $ 300,000 to put toward development of a civic center and new city hall. Bolivar Mayor <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> said the gift came so unexpectedly that no plans were drawn up yet for the civic center. But he said $ 104,000 was spent Thursday to buy property for the new center. The rest of the money will be used to build the civic center after matching funds are raised. `` A civic center has been discussed here for years, but we have n't had the funds,'' <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> said. In December 1986, <PERSON> Delarue </PERSON> established a $ 3 million trust fund that he said was a gesture of thanks to the community where he grew up. The trust benefits the city, <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and various public agencies. Recipients received an initial interest payment of $ 150,000 this year and expect to receive annual payments of $ 240,000 until 2100, when the principal will be given to the city. <PERSON> Delarue </PERSON> said he keeps track of what is going on in Bolivar through old friends who still live in the town of about 6,000 people 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. He said he learned about two weeks ago that a 2.2-acre plot of land near the central square was available through an estate sale, and immediately thought of buying it for the city. `` There was no planning,'' <PERSON> Delarue </PERSON> said Monday in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> home. `` It's probably the city's last chance to find such a nice piece of property -LRB- close to downtown.

<TEXT>
 Attendance at the <ORGANIZATION> Sixteenth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has declined dramatically in the 25 years since dynamite killed four black girls, but the pastor says its membership is worldwide in spirit. `` Sixteenth Street is not a local church _ Sept. 15, 1963, made sure of that,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` It is in the truest sense the people's church.'' The church, which is marking the 25th anniversary of the bombing this week, nearly filled its 1,500 seats regularly in the 1940s and 1950s and became a rallying point for civil rights demonstrators who filled it in the 1960s. Now, it has about 100 members. The church has suffered common urban church problems such as members moving away from downtown. At Sunday's service, which opened the week's anniversary observance program, the balcony was empty, as were many pews on the main floor, and visitors outnumbered members when asked to stand. `` That did n't look so good, as far as the church itself was concerned,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, a deacon and member of the church for 60 years. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, who plays the clarinet and saxophone, is the lone member of the church orchestra, which once had 20 musicians. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> said the church's role during the civil rights movement, while making it a landmark, did not please all the members. `` We suffered a great deal because we had so many threats coming into the church,'' said <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>. The church was formed in 1873 and the building, designed by a black architect and built by a black contractor, was erected in 1906. The bombing heavily damaged the basement area where the girls were killed but the damage was not as severe elsewhere in the building. A white man, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambliss </PERSON>, was convicted of murder in the explosion. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the media coverage of the 25th anniversary may help bring more people to the church. `` Our hope is that there will be some benefits to the whole community, including members of <ORGANIZATION> Sixteenth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` We are hoping that we will get the attendance up,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, chairman of the church's board of trustees and a member since 1965. `` That would help us a lot.''

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has canceled its critically praised but low-rated `` Main Street,'' an afternoon news program for children. `` I made the decision last Wednesday that there was just no way that show could live.

<HEAD>Political Challengers Favor Free TV-Time Requirement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A solid majority of political challengers but less than one-third of incumbents say television and radio stations should be required to give <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates free air time, says a report on the role of media in congressional campaigns. The report, by the nonpartisan <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION>, said a requirement that included more time for debates would make an overall lid on campaign spending much more palatable, even to incumbents. `` Beyond the 30-Second Spot'' was based on a survey of 141 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and 40 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> incumbents and challengers who ran in 1986. They were asked how they used electronic media and how they might want to change the laws affecting political broadcasting. Half of the 181 candidates surveyed spent more money on commercial television than on direct mail, radio or newspaper ads; only 12.7 percent of the candidates tried to buy air time longer than 30 or 60 seconds. Among incumbents, 29.5 percent favored requiring broadcasters to provide free media time, while 60.9 percent of challengers supported the idea. Some 40 percent of the incumbents and 75 percent of the challengers said any free media arrangement should include mandated debate time for congressional candidates. If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were to pass a free media requirement, the center found, 54.9 percent of those surveyed said they would accept a limit on overall campaign spending. That included 48 percent of the incumbents running for re-election. Based on these and other findings, the center made a number of recommendations aimed at providing free and lower-cost media exposure to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> candidates. `` No one of these changes can entirely replace the ubiquitous 30-second commercial, or drastically reduce the cost of campaigns,'' the study said. `` But taken together, the center believes that these proposals would make significant contributions to the American electoral system.'' First and foremost, the center said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should require television stations to run two hours of special programming about <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> races and two hours about <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races each election season. Programs would have to be at least five minutes long. The time could be turned over to candidates or the stations could produce the material themselves. No station would have to cover all the elections in its market. The center also recommended that the equal opportunities rule, which forces broadcasters to give competing candidates comparable air time, be changed to apply to only major party and strong third-party candidates. If one candidate declines to debate, the center said, under some circumstances the other should be given air time alone without triggering equal-time rules. In addition, the center recommended that candidates receive 30 percent discounts on air time that can not be pre-empted by higher-paying advertisers. This was prompted by findings that although candidates are entitled by law to discount rates, they are n't using them. `` Candidates are inclined to pay higher rates to ensure that their ads are not pre-empted,'' the study said. `` Overall, 54.2 percent of candidates preferred to purchase higher priced, non-pre-emptible advertising time rather than lower cost, pre-emptible time.''

 Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo claimed victory today in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary, saying state officials had discovered vote counting errors that he says reversed the results of the election. Challenger <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> had been declared the winner of Saturday's primary. Woo had conceded the race. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, adminsitrative director of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said today a keypunch operator made a mistake that gave Beard 2,800 more votes than he received. `` When this correction is made, Woo will instead win by six votes,'' Woo said in a press release. But <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said, `` I have no idea who is ahead.'' The unofficial tally had given Beard 22,418 votes to Woo's 19,624 The revised results would give Beard only 19,618 votes to Woo's 19,624. The final numbers, however, could change because votes from nine precincts still must be counted. Woo also said he believes additional absentee ballots will be counted. `` I have no idea how it happened, but I am satisfied in my own mind that it was human error,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said today. Beard campaign manager <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> had no comment. `` <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> does n't think it is appropriate until the results are completed,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> wants to have the most accurate and clear count there is.'' The vote discrepancy came in the 23rd representative district in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where there about 280 registered Democrats. In that district, however, Beard's total was tallied at 2,828 votes when he actually received only 28 votes, elections officials said. A recount is expected. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> meets tonight to count ballots from the nine precincts. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> includes the city of <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>. The winner of the primary will run against incumbent Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, R-Del., in the November general election Woo had conceded the race Saturday night, saying `` I always said it was a tough way to earn a living.'' Woo, a 51-year-old physics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION>, was elected lieutenant governor four years ago in his first bid for elected office. The lieutenant governor, who will leave his post in January, had been considered a shoo-in for re-election, but chose instead to run for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Beard had been heavily outspent by <PERSON> Woo </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, who enjoyed the financial backing of Chinese-Americans from across the nation. Beard, 49, had the backing of most Democratic organization leaders and labor. Beard, who has served as chairman for job creation commissions under the last four presidents, said his experience in public service helped in the campaign. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race was the only statewide competition on the ballot. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, seeking a fourth six-year term, is running unopposed.

 Many Eastford residents consider themselves country folks, so town officials decided they could cope with the bull that came out of the closet.

First Selectman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehouse </PERSON> found the weather vane last spring and had it mounted on the town office building. `` This is country, not the middle of the city,'' <PERSON> Whitehouse </PERSON> said.

 Your grandmother always knew chicken soup could cure a lot of ills, and now <ORGANIZATION> Holyoke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> is set to take <PERSON> Grandma </PERSON>'s place. Low-sodium, low-fat frozen chicken noodle and vegetable beef soups were a natural outgrowth of the hospital's 2-year-old frozen meal program for patients on restricted diets, said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ascolese </PERSON>, food services manager. `` When we started we figured we would be satisfied if we were able to sell 400 meals a month,'' <PERSON> Ascolese </PERSON> said. `` Now we are selling 400 meals a week and we have some customers that drive more than 100 miles one-way just to buy them.'' Many commercial canned or dried soups contain hundreds of milligrams of sodium. <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>'s frozen `` Just What the Doctor Ordered'' soup contains just 22 milligrams, <PERSON> Ascolese </PERSON> said. `` The typical restricted diet for a patient with high blood pressure or heart trouble limits sodium intake to 1,000 milligrams a day, so if they have a bowl of commercial soup for lunch, they have pretty much used up the sodium allotment for the day.'' Hospitals in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> also have soups on their take-out menus. <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION> began test-marketing its soup Monday. Soups are packaged in 7-ounce microwaveable containers that sell for 65 cents apiece. The take-out food program was initially aimed at recently released patients on restricted diets, but customers also have included the elderly and younger people trying to lose weight or avoid preservatives, <PERSON> Ascolese </PERSON> said.

 Health officials immunized people in <LOCATION> Lynchburg </LOCATION> and four surrounding counties Monday as they tried to keep an outbreak of measles at the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> from becoming a regional epidemic. `` We're trying now to keep it confined to the campus and keep it from spreading to the community,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official. `` We're hoping we're going to nip it in the bud at this point.'' With some 40 cases reported among students, faculty and people who had visited the university, Ms. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> estimated at least 200 more people will be sickened by rubeola measles. `` It's generally four times as high'' as the initial outbreak, she said. Officials vaccinated 1,800 students, staff and faculty over the weekend. <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> had not been quarantined, she said, but people were advised not to go on campus until they have been immunized. Free vaccinations were offered Monday at clinics in <LOCATION> Lynchburg </LOCATION> and in the counties of <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Appomattox </LOCATION>. It was too soon to say how many people would be vaccinated. Health officials said people born before 1957, when immunizations for the illness were first started, are generally considered to be immune to rubeola measles. The disease strikes victims at first with a red rash that begins on the face and chest and persists for about three days. The disease can be fatal, according to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` There were four people who died last year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> out of 3,655 cases,'' Ms. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. The disease apparently came to the university by a student who had the measles, she said.

<HEAD>Lime Dispenser May Help Fish Survive Acid Rain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists say a device that releases lime into streams to combat the effect of acid rain appears to be reducing acidity for two to three miles downstream. The question that remains is whether more fish eggs will survive. `` If we can improve streams for several years, we can allow the remnant species to improve or at least to maintain itself,'' Dr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Klauda </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> senior fisheries biologist, told The -LRB- <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> -RRB- Sun in a story published Monday. This spring, <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> scientists began testing the idea of adding lime to neutralize acid rain in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> streams. The idea was an extension of work done in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, where government officials have fought acid rain by liming acidic lakes. But buffering running water in a stream requires a new technology, one on which experiments have just begun in this country. If follow-up tests to the Hopkins work prove conclusive, the scientists say liming could be a temporary solution to streams affected greatly by increased acidity. The device is called a lime doser, a large, round concrete structure that perches on the edge of a stream. When it rains, the doser sends measured amounts of a calcium and water mixture into the stream, making the stream more hospitable for fish. Two lime dosers were placed in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> streams in 1986. They were computer-powered and cost about $ 40,000 each, too expensive for <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> to use in great numbers. But the new lime doser, placed on Stocketts Run in the <LOCATION> Patuxent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, is a new design that does n't rely on a computer. This version, costing $ 10,000 to $ 15,000, is the first to be put in a stream in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Klauda </PERSON> said. In some cases, the fish larvae below the doser had a significantly higher survival rate, but in other cases it was only marginally better, <PERSON> Klauda </PERSON> said. `` We do n't know if they make a clear-cut difference in the survival of eggs and larvae,'' he said. `` It might well turn out that for a few key streams still in good shape or for streams that are trying to be restored, this approach would work,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirshfield </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> research and monitoring division of the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, which helped fund <PERSON> Klauda </PERSON>'s research with Living Lakes, a not-for-profit group funded by utility companies A survey last year found that at least 10 percent of the state's rivers have acid levels that kill fish larvae under laboratory conditions

 Several used medical items were found on a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> sidewalk, and six boxes of a prescription antibiotic were found on a playground, authorities said Monday.

<TEXT>
 Smoke from the forest fires in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> has drifted as far as the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, turning sunsets a fiery red and even affecting the weather. The setting sun `` had a kind of an eerie appearance,'' said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, about 1,200 miles east of the fires. The hazy smoke made the sun look like `` a big glowing red ball ... it was a very red color which made it spectacular in that regard.'' The smoke was trapped in an upper atmospheric trough, about 15,000 to 20,000 feet up, and was carried by wind over the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, toward the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and out to sea, said meteorologist <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> of the weather service in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The thin layer of smoke passed over the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area Sunday, dimming the sun to a reddish-orange and lowering temperatures between 5 and 10 degrees, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. `` The only effect we ` re having is it ` s interfering with the radiation of the sun,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armbrust </PERSON>, an air-quality engineer with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> still had a thin, transparent layer of haze Monday, said weather service meteorologist <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>. Usually, smoke from large fires is dispersed and is not noticeable so far away, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. Because the smoke was so high up, the smell was not noticeable on the ground and it did not contribute to air pollution, he added. Pilots reported seeing the smoke layer over <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> when they climbed to cruising altitudes of 30,000 and 40,000 feet, but no visibility problems were reported. However, visibility was a problem closer to the fires. In western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, about 400 miles east of the blazes, visibility has been as low as half a mile, and foresters warned that would hinder detection of local forest fires. Most of the smoke over <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> cleared out over the weekend when a front moved in, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said. `` This should be the end of it, at least for now,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's a strange phenomenon,'' he added. `` It happens occasionally with volcanoes. They spew smoke and it gets trapped in a particular layer -LRB- of the atmosphere -RRB- and it can go all around the globe.''

The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> was kidnapped Sunday as he was leaving his wedding reception. They said his Lebanese bride was detained briefly. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> subdued his abductors after several hours, reached a Syrian army checkpoint and was escorted to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, where he was turned over to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official, the sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>' mother reportedly lives in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of anti-government demonstrators marched through <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> on Monday, and opposition leaders demanded that an interim government be appointed to supervise multiparty elections. In other developments, more than 1,000 school children fasted in support of the protesters, and the military said it would shoot demonstrators spreading a report that two armed forces commanders had threatened to join the protest. Gen. <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s defense minister and armed forces chief of staff, said in a nationwide broadcast Monday night that the public and military should support the government's plan to supervise multiparty elections soon. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> said the military had allowed protesters to demonstrate freely `` to avoid possible misunderstandings amidst various attempts to discredit the armed forces by way of spreading false rumors, propaganda and exaggerations.'' Many thousands of student-led demonstrators marched through the capital, shouting demands for an interim government and multiparty democracy. At least five separate groups were counted, and estimates of the total number of protesters ranged from 10,000 to more than 100,000. More soldiers were seen on the streets Monday, but they did not interfere with the protesters, who dispersed peacefully. In their first joint statement, opposition leaders again demanded the formation of an interim government to lead the transition to democracy. Opposition leaders <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, former Defense Minister Tin Oo and <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> listed their demands in a letter to <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>. A copy was given to The Associated Press. The government did not immediately respond to the letter. None of the opposition leaders have specified who should be in the interim government, saying only it should comprise people outside the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and who are `` acceptable to all the people.'' They also have not said if they would be willing to serve in a transitional government. `` Since the government has lost the confidence of the nation, people will have no confidence in the general elections to be held by the government-appointed election supervision commission,'' it said. `` We therefore demand the immediate formation of an interim government to rebuild the economy, revive the administrative machinery, reestablish democracy and hold general elections,'' it said. President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> has rejected the call for an interim government. But on Saturday he bowed to weeks of nationwide protests and announced that the ruling party would relinquish its 26-year monopoly on power and hold the first multiparty elections since 1960. Parliament on Sunday authorized the government to amend the constitution to permit a multiparty system and hold the election within six weeks. Students, ranging in age from about 10 to 17, fasted again Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> compound, a longtime rallying point for anti-government protests. The students, many wearing school uniforms, held banners saying `` Give Us Democracy!'' and `` Give Us Interim Government!'' The fast, which last 36 hours, ended Monday night. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said demonstrators were spreading false rumors that two senior commanders threatened to attack government buildings if authorities did not agree by Tuesday to form an interim government. The threat was contained in unsigned, mimeographed leaflets distributed in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> that purportedly were issued by the navy's vice chief, Rear Adm. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Khin </PERSON>, and the air force's vice chief, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Tin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> `` This evening, false propaganda was spread through the distribution of leaflets by cars and through announcements by loudspeakers on the main streets of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> city,'' the broadcast said. `` The defense forces can no longer tolerate this and will open fire if they come across this group of people,'' it said.

 The $ 12.8 million <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> Sculpture Garden, the nation's largest urban sculpture site, was called an `` artistic triumph'' by one official in its opening ceremony. About 3,000 artists, city and national officials and visitors applauded as 10,000 pastel balloons rose from the 7.5-acre garden and a high school band played on the 375-foot-long <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hixon </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiteney </PERSON> bridge-sculpture in Saturday's ceremony. <PERSON> Claes </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldenburg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the sculptor of the garden's 59-foot-long `` <LOCATION> Spoonbridge </LOCATION> and Cherry'' fountain, declared the opening `` an epochal event. The sculpture garden is the newest addition to the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> park system's 170 facilities. It is one of the few <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sculpture gardens that is free and open to the public year round. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> director <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and Park Superintendent <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> officially opened the garden with giant scissors that snipped a red ribbon tied between the garden's entrance portals, a columnar sculpture by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> artist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Puryear </PERSON>. During the ceremony, Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said the garden was an `` artistic triumph'' that enhanced the cultural quality of life in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> `` with its unique blend of artistic vision, environmental beauty, social generosity and professional optimism.'' Artists admired each other's work and children climbed over the artist-designed benches and patted <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON>'s bronze horse, a sculpture that appears to be made of driftwood. `` Its really a neat place,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabs </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Richfield </PERSON>, adding that he was especially impressed that children `` can touch the sculpture.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Koshalek </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the garden contained an `` outstanding selection of sculptures'' and was a model for other cities.

 Police said Monday they were baffled by the disappearance of a 7-year-old girl who was discovered missing from her bedroom Saturday. Authorities were trying to determine whether <PERSON> Jaclyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowaliby </PERSON> was abducted by a relative, kidnapped, or had met with foul play. Police said it was unlikely that she ran away. <PERSON> Jaclyn </PERSON> was last seen about 11 p.m. Friday when her mother, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>, checked her bedroom. The girl's adoptive father, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowaliby </PERSON>, discovered her missing at about 8 a.m. the next morning when he checked her bedroom. Police said <PERSON> Dowaliby </PERSON> also discovered a basement window in the house was broken and the front door of the home was ajar. `` We have n't ruled out anything at this time, because we've just got a lot of unanswered questions,'' said Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bittin </PERSON> of the police force in this suburb south of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bittin </PERSON> added, `` The fact that there was nothing disturbed in the house, no signs of violent struggle, nobody heard anything, that brings to mind ... questions, <PERSON> Bittin </PERSON> said. He said the case differs from a typical kidnapping. `` They're not a wealthy family There have n't been any calls or notes asking for ransom,'' he said. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents have determined that the girl's imprisoned father had nothing to do with the disappearance. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Guess </PERSON>, the child's natural father, was questioned Sunday by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where he is in prison, and expressed shock about <PERSON> Jaclyn </PERSON>'s disappearance, <PERSON> Bittin </PERSON> said. `` He was totally shocked, he was totally unaware of anything that had happened,'' <PERSON> Bittin </PERSON> said. Based on statements from Guess, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has decided `` that he had nothing to do with it,'' the captain said. <PERSON> Bittin </PERSON> said he did not know why Guess was imprisoned. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> did not immediately return telephone calls. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents planned interviews Monday with relatives of the natural father. Also Monday, local and state police continued their foot-search in wooded areas near the girl's home. A canine unit was used to search a nearby field, but found no clues. He said there was no reason to suspect foul play `` other than the fact that we have n't been able to locate her. Unfortunately, the possibilty is always there for that ... but we do n't have any proof one way or the other.'' <PERSON> Jaclyn </PERSON> was described by police as being about 4 feet tall and weighing about 60 pounds. She has shoulder-length brown hair and blue eyes.

<HEAD>Panel Recommends No Suspension For City Councilman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 City Councilman <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> need not be suspended from office over his weapons indictment since the charge does not involve his performance in office, a special panel reported Monday to the governor. Gov. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> appointed the panel last month after <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' indictment on a felony weapons charge, which stemmed from an incident in March at <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. Security officers found a handgun in <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' briefcase as he passed through a checkpoint. The charge was later made a felony after <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was cited as a habitual violator; he has a string of traffic violations. A 1984 state law provides for the governor to appoint a three-member panel to investigate the cases of public officials under indictment. The panel recommends whether suspension from office is in order. Attorney General <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> previously said such a panel was not required in <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' case, since his indictment did not involve his official duties. But <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> disagreed. The panel, composed of <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> Councilman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Councilman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> A.J </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McClung </PERSON>, voted unanimously Monday against recommending that <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> suspend <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> said the panel found the indictment `` did not relate to or adversely impact the administration of his office'' or the rights and interests of the public. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a veteran civil rights activist, has said he routinely carries a gun for protection. He explained the airport incident by saying he had removed the gun from his car and put it in his briefcase, then forgot to leave it behind before heading for his flight. At the time, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was cited and allowed to make his plane. <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officers later arrested <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> on the felony charge.

<HEAD>Officials: War Against Mediterranean Fruit Flies In Final Stage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A $ 1 million effort to rid the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of the destructive <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> fruit fly apparently succeeded, officials say. Officials plan to intensify trapping efforts for a month more, however, and hope to declare the pest eradicated if no more wild Medflies show up by the end of October, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, chief deputy to the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> agricultural commissioner. A state quarantine barring anyone from removing home-grown produce from 62 square miles of the valley will remain in effect until eradication is declared, <PERSON> Dorthea </PERSON> <PERSON> Zadig </PERSON>, program manager of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. Six wild Medflies were discovered in the state's traps in late July, but no new flies have been found since, Ms. <PERSON> Zadig </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, pest prevention division supervisor of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said officials are optimistic. `` I think we'll be able to announce eradication by the end of October,'' he said. The attack included a one-time pesticide treatment followed by the release of millions of sterile male Medflies and imposition of a quarantine on home-grown produce. The Medfly, a severe threat to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s multibillion-dollar agricultural industry, is considered one of the most destructive crop-damaging pests because it preys on more than 250 varieties of produce, reproduces rapidly and survives in different climates, officials said. By the end of August, one complete generation of Medflies is thought to have come and gone since officials began releasing the sterile male flies, Ms. <PERSON> Zadig </PERSON> said. The sterile fly release will continue at a rate of 40 million a week for one more generation, through this month, she said.

<TEXT>
 Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> slammed into <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> on Monday with torrential rains and 115 mph winds that ripped roofs off homes and buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines. No serious injuries were immediately reported in the city of 750,000 people, which was hit by the full force of the hurricane around noon. For half an hour, the hurricane lashed the city, tearing branches from trees, blowing down fences and whipping paper through the air. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported heavy damage to <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>'s airport and aircraft parked on its fields The first shock let up as the eye of the storm moved across the city. Skies brightened, the winds died down and people waited for an hour before the second blow of the hurricane arrived. All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Flights from the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, reportedly next in the path of the hurricane, arrived in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> packed with travelers cutting short their vacations. `` People were running around in the main lobby of our hotel -LRB- on <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> -RRB- like chickens with their heads cut off,'' said one man. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> report said the hurricane was moving west at 17 mph with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph. It said <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> would receive up to 10 inches of rain that would cause flash floods and mud slides. `` Right now it's actually moving over <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that island, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerful hurricane,'' he said. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> reached <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> after skirting southern <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Hurricane warnings were issued Monday for the south coast of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Camaguey </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, while warnings were discontinued for the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. High winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> overnight, toppling trees, causing local flooding and littering streets with branches. Most of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s 2.3 million people stayed home, boarding up windows in preparation for the hurricane. The popular north coast resort area, on the other side of the mountains, was expected to receive heavy rain but not as much damage from the hurricane as the south coast, where officials urged residents to seek higher ground. <ORGANIZATION> Havana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, reported Monday that 25,000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in <LOCATION> Guantanamo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> on the nation's southeastern coast as <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s winds and rain began to brush the island In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> reported its bases at <LOCATION> Guantanamo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roads </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, had taken various precautionary steps but appeared to be safe from the brunt of the hurricane. Lt. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a spokesman, said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> station at <LOCATION> Guantanamo </LOCATION> reported that as of 2:30 p.m. EDT, the brunt of the storm appeared to be passing southeastern <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` They have reported maximum winds of 25 knots and gusts up to 50 knots,'' said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. `` But there are no reports of injuries or damage.'' The spokesman said earlier in the day, <LOCATION> Guantanamo </LOCATION> had moved to `` Condition Two,'' meaning electrical power usage was cut back to only essential uses and `` all non-essential personnel sent to their barracks.'' The storm also skirted <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> without causing any damage to military facilities, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. Sheets said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was expected next to sweep over the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, on its westward track, and in two to three days veer northwest into the southern <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Residents of the neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Caymans </ORGANIZATION>, a British dependency to the northwest, were urged to `` rush all preparatory actions.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> warned that the <ORGANIZATION> Caymans </ORGANIZATION> could expect high waters and large waves `` which may undermine buildings along the beaches.'' `` All interests in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> should continue to monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane,'' the service advised. Forecaster <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerrish </PERSON> on Sunday described <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> `` certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> for a long time.''

She said the full contents of <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>'s collection wo n't be known until it is received at <LOCATION> Wesleyan </LOCATION> and catalogued Once the material arrives, <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> will join the likes of directors <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Capra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazan </PERSON> with collections at <LOCATION> Wesleyan </LOCATION>. `` He's a unique American artist.

The Wesleyan archives, created in 1985, also includes the collection of actress <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>, as well as a collection of films, papers from the Omnibus performing arts television show, and a collection of American movie posters. <PERSON> Basinger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> has apparently saved everything stemming from his career, including from the days when he was a regular on the television show, `` Rawhide.'' She said <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>'s collection was n't the result of `` star vanity, but from a serious, professional career.'' <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that his relationship with the Museum of Modern Art began in 1980, when it showed his `` Bronco Billy'' in 1980 at the conclusion of week-long retrospective.

<TEXT>
 The conspiracy trial of former beauty queen <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> does n't begin until Wednesday, but the rush to get press credentials for the highly publicized divorce-fixing case began early Monday, very early. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a researcher for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, showed up at 2 a.m. and found two guys already on line outside the courthouse. The early birds, recent graduates from <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, were holding a place for a reporter for the magazine <ORGANIZATION> Vanity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. `` It was actually very funny,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, himself a recent <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> graduate. `` There we were in the middle of the night, three <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> grads standing around telling jokes and waiting to get in.'' Within hours they were joined by a dozen more place-holders, sketch artists, reporters and writers seeking the 19 remaining seats allotted to the news media in the tiny courtroom where the trial will be held. `` None of us slept well for two days over the weekend, worrying about it,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlinson </PERSON>, a courtroom artist for <ORGANIZATION> WNYW-TV </ORGANIZATION>, who got to the federal courthouse in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> at 4:45 a.m. The trip downtown turned into a nightmare for <PERSON> Tomlinson </PERSON>, who got stuck at an unattended subway exit that was n't supposed to open until 7 a.m. Eventually `` two subway workers came out of the dark with lanterns'' and freed him. The object of the news media anxiety is what may be one of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s most sensational criminal trials in years. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, a former Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and one-time city cultural affairs commissioner, is charged with giving a city job to the daughter of the judge presiding over her boyfriend's divorce in a bid to lighten his alimony and child support load. Jury selection is to begin Wednesday for the trial of Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>; her boyfriend, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` Andy'' <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>; and the divorce judge, former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Hortense </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>. The three are charged with mail fraud and conspiracy for an alleged scheme to fix <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s 1985 divorce. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> also is charged with obstruction of justice. Seating is limited because no large courtroom was available at the 31-story federal courthouse. `` The larger courtrooms had already been scheduled months in advance for other trials,'' explained <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirsch </PERSON>, the chief non-judicial administrator of the courthouse. Despite an informal request by reporters to find something bigger, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> elected to stay in his regular courtroom, which only seats about 50 spectators. <PERSON> Kirsch </PERSON> set aside about 30 seats for the news media: 11 for the resident courthouse press corps and the remaining 19 for artists and reporters on a first-come, first-served basis. `` The judge made a combination of such strictures that it was designed to limit all but the most determined,'' complained Daily News artist <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Papin </PERSON>, the fourth artist on line, who arrived at 6 a.m. There were seats for six artists, and <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> WPIX-TV </ORGANIZATION> was the seventh artist on line. However, because `` I got there seconds after the sixth artist and I was the last artist on line,'' officials made an exception and gave her a pass. All of the passes were handed out by 9 a.m. Out of luck, and on the growing waiting list, were such news organizations as <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> kept an 18-year dossier on the late Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> and furnished documents to President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> purporting to detail <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>'s `` pro-communist record,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday The newspaper said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had furnished it with 231 pages of files on <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, some of them heavily censored, and withheld nearly 400 pages, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted 27 months ago. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> represented <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in the state Assembly from 1956 until his election to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1964, and remained a congressman until his death in 1983. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> files cover 1953 to 1971, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said. Among other things, the files show that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> tried to block appointment of a <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> aide as <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> postmaster, kept Director <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> informed of details of <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>'s activities, and compiled unflattering information about the congressman's family, the newspaper said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said Monday he was unaware of the files and could not comment but said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has since come under new guidelines. Now, `` if a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has committed or is conspiring to commit some violation of the law, certainly we would have an investigation,'' but not otherwise, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. Assemblyman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, the congressman's brother, said he had not seen the files but called the report `` more proof of <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>'s paranoia He used to see Communists under his bed.'' The files say <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> inquired about <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>'s background in 1964 and was sent a series of documents from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> the next year. The documents referred repeatedly to <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>'s association with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, and criticized his attempt to scrap loyalty oaths for lawmakers and his opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Un-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Activities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said. Also in 1964, <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to observe the search for three missing civil rights workers later found murdered. Then-Assistant <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Cartha </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLoach </PERSON> recommended that agents on the scene receive <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> politely but tell him nothing about the investigation, the newspaper said. A December 1965 memo from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> field office recommended that, in light of <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>'s `` very questionable background,'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> oppose appointment of the congressman's administrative assistant, <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, as <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s postmaster The field office urged that damaging information on <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> be forwarded to the White House. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was appointed, however, and served as postmaster for 14 years. The dossier also cites instances in which <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> criticized statements by <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> in 1969 called the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` the most notorious liar in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> approached the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s chief <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> agent at a party in a `` very belligerent manner'' and said <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>'s statement had been `` off-base,'' the agent said in a memo to <LOCATION> Hoover </LOCATION> Also in 1969, the files quote <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> attacking as disparaging to Chinese-Americans a statement by <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> that some Chinese-Americans `` would assist Red <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in supplying needed material -LRB- for espionage -RRB- or promoting Red Chinese propaganda.'' An unnamed <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> official said in a report that <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> was `` a longtime apologist for Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' and recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> `` set him straight'' about the Communist `` menace.''

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won endorsements Monday from former national security advisers to Presidents <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> as he assembled a bipartisan team of advisers on foreign policy and defense issues. <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, the most prominent Democrat on the 13-member panel, told reporters he was proud to have served <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> but said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ rather than <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ `` can best fashion an effective bipartisan foreign policy.'' Said <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>: `` He is not a novice in that critical area of public policy on which our national survival depends.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took the occasion to accuse <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of tending to rely on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and other international bodies to resolve foreign crises. `` We can not abdicate our responsibility for leadership,'' he said. The panel also includes <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, national security adviser to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and secretary of state under <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s national security adviser. Others named to the largely Republican panel were former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, former ambassador <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, former White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>; <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON>, former secretaries of defense; Sens. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan., and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>; former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, and retired Adm. <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, former chief of naval operations. <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>'s endorsement of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` not unexpected,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, a spokesman at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign headquarters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` We will be watching to see whether Mr. <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON> will be drafting speeches for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the foreign policy of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, alluding to repeated <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> attacks on <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s tenure On Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delivered the first of three major campaign speeches this week that are intended to counter Republican allegations that he is weak on defense and naive about foreign affairs. `` The primary foreign policy objective of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration can be stated very simply: to restore respect for American leadership in a changing world,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a campaign rally in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. He accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of failed leadership in combating terrorism, drug trafficking and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficits in world trade. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has no formal advisory panel of national security experts for his campaign. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Albright </PERSON> has been his chief foreign affairs adviser for the past year. In addition to Ms. <PERSON> Albright </PERSON>, who served in the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and is a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> receives advice on those issues from Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., and a trio from the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> They are <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnesdale </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said in a statement he had `` read everything I could find on foreign and national security policy uttered by Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ which is admittedly a skimpy body of work.'' `` I am convinced that his views on national security are incompatible with a strong <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, his approach to <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations would undermine our ability to move the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> toward more responsible behavior, and his view of international affairs would keep us from shaping the new world decades of dedication have brought into view,'' <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> told the same news conference that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` is without experience in foreign affairs, and his penchant for multilateral diplomacy fails to recognize the vital role of dynamic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leadership in moving regional conflicts toward resolutions compatible with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. interests.''

<HEAD>US Lowers Forecast of Soviet Grain Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prospects for this year's grain harvest in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have deteriorated somewhat because of a drop in some yields, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The Soviet crop is now expected to produce about 205 million metric tons, a reduction of 5 million tons from projections a month ago, officials said. The lowered estimate was based primarily on early yield results released by the Soviets and on the Sept. 7 disclosure on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> television that the grain harvest would be less than expected. Reduced production estimates included barley, 47.5 million tons, down 3 million tons from the August forecast; rye, 16.5 million tons, down 1 million; and oats, 16.5 million, down 1 million. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also is expected to boost grain imports further to about 27 million tons in 1988-89, an increase of 2 million tons from indications last month but still short of the 32 million tons imported in 1987-88. `` Over the past month, numerous reports have been received of U.S.S.R. grain purchases, breaking the lull in Soviet grain buying activity that had prevailed since last spring,'' the report said. `` The bulk of the recent purchases have been coarse grains -LRB- such as corn -RRB-, although reports have also indicated wheat sales by some of the major suppliers.''

 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, on his first summit-level mission into black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, met Monday with leaders of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s Marxist government, which has blamed much of its woes on <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s nation. President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> shook hands with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> at an airfield welcoming ceremony, then took him on a tour by jeep of the nearby <LOCATION> Cahora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bassa </LOCATION> hydroelectric project before a two-hour meeting. Afterward, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said he invited <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> to visit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the two leaders issued a joint communique affirming their support for regional cooperation. They said committees would be formed to deal with issues such as trade, economic development and migrant labor. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has signed an agreement to help rehabilitate the <LOCATION> Cahora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bassa </LOCATION> project, in the northwestern province of Tete. The power line leading to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from the dam near <LOCATION> Songo </LOCATION> has been sabotaged repeatedly by guerrillas which <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> claims are aided by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s security forces. <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> gave assurances that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was not helping the rebels. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was to go to <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> later for talks Tuesday with President <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamuzu </PERSON> <PERSON> Banda </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> is the only African state that has full diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 5 million whites have established a racially segregated society and the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> were to discuss a mutual non-aggression treaty signed by their countries in 1984. The treaty lapsed in 1985 when <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> produced evidence that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> violated the agreement by continuing to assist the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION>. That guerrilla movement began an insurgency two years after <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> won independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. The civil war, combined with drought, has left millions of Mozambicans homeless and hungry. Many Western governments, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have increased aid to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and support its claim that the rebels receive covert logistical and communications aid from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> insists it no longer helps the rebels, and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was expected to attempt to persuade <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> to mute the allegations. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was accompanied on his trip by his Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>'s delegation, which left the capital of <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Songo </LOCATION> early today, included three <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers and two military commanders, according to the Mozambican news agency AIM. As part of an effort to improve its regional image, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has in the past year expanded its trade mission in <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> and pursued economic development possibilities in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. The two countries also have signed an agreement aimed at rehabilitating the <LOCATION> Cahora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bassa </LOCATION> project in <LOCATION> Tete </LOCATION> so <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> can purchase power. The rebels repeatedly have sabotaged power lines leading from <LOCATION> Cahora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bassa </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Even when their relations were badly strained, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> maintained extensive ties. Tens of thousands of Mozambicans work as miners and migrant laborers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>'s electricity is supplied by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. During his 10 years in power, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has had few chances to travel in black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In 1986, he was one of numerous dignitaries who attended the coronation of <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Mswati </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, and in 1987 he made a secret visit to South African troops fighting in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. He had hoped to visit <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, earlier this year in conjunction with peace talks on <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> allies reportedly threatened to scuttle the talks if he came.

 A minister went on trial Monday on charges of beheading a handyman and burning down his church in an alleged attempt to assume a new identity and disappear with $ 50,000 in church money. Jury selection is expected to take most of the week in the first-degree murder and arson trial of the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, who faces the death penalty if convicted. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> may take the witness stand to break his yearlong silence in the decapitation of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON>. The slaying and fire on June 15, 1987, at <ORGANIZATION> Emmanuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pentecostal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oneness </ORGANIZATION> stunned <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s parishioners. Some have stuck by him since <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON>'s body was found rolled up in a scorched carpet. `` Two days before this happened we would have given him our last dime,'' said <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 30, who with others in the 40-member congregation has been attending weekly services in a borrowed building in nearby <LOCATION> Gallatin </LOCATION>. `` I do n't feel personally betrayed. More let down than anything else.'' About half the members have stopped attending services, she said. `` I'm sad for him. I guess I'm a little bitter, but you have to keep the love of God no matter what,'' said <PERSON> Marlane </PERSON> <PERSON> McClanahan </PERSON>, 35, who has not been attending services held by the current pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> McClanahan </PERSON> and other church members said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, 43, was well-liked and respected during his nearly 20 years as their preacher. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> had befriended <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON>, who was the ex-husband of a church member and had been in trouble with the law. Police initially thought it was <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s body firefighters discovered in the carpet because <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s belt and other articles of clothing were found on the body. The head and lower part of the right arm had been severed with butcher-like precision, and <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON> initially was suspected of killing <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> until medical examiners identified the body. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, who had worked part-time as a supermarket butcher to earn extra money, showed up at his lawyer's office two days after the fire. His lawyers have since turned over to authorities a map of a marina where they said the head and arm could be found, though a search begun last week was halted Sunday after divers came up empty-handed. `` The divers ca n't see anything. They can only feel. It's zero visibiliy'' in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barkley </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Stewart </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>. A birth certificate, driver's license, post office box and the title to a motorcycle like the one seen whizzing away from the fire have turned up in the name of a man dead since 1951, court documents show. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s picture was on the driver's license that bore the dead man's name. Neither <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s lawyer nor the prosecution would discuss details the case. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> is not charged in connection with the money taken from the church. <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON>, 32, was divorced from the victim but said the two were close to a reconciliation. Mrs. <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, stopped attending church services soon after her husband's body was found. `` I loved him very much,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON> said the slaying and arrest of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> have been difficult for the 4-year-old son she and <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON> had. `` It's been real hard for him to understand,'' she said. Members of the denomination formed in the early 1930s believe in faith healing and sometimes practice such rituals as foot washing and talking in tongues. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s former parishioners are looking ahead to the Thanksgiving opening of a new church under construction on the other side of town from their old meeting place. `` He was a friend,'' said <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, 63, another church member. `` We had known him since he was a boy. Our children and he grew up together. There was n't anything ever bad about the boy. He just did good things. We're amazed that someone we've known and never knew anything bad against is guilty of this.''

<HEAD>US Holds Off Decision on Israeli Request for Diplomatic Immunity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is seeking diplomatic immunity for 47 staff members of its military procurement office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> but has been unable to win <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> consent after months of intermittent talks, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Monday. The officials said the office has been investigated for involvement in two cases of illegal export of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military technology, but they could not confirm a published report that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> oppose the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> request because of law enforcement considerations. According to the officials, who insisted on anonymity, majority sentiment at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appeared to be in support of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> request. They said that members of an Egyptian military procurement office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have been given diplomatic immunity. And they noted that an Egyptian military officer who worked at the office was arrested by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities earlier this year in an alleged plot to smuggle missile components to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The officer was freed after claiming diplomatic immunity and has since returned to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is seeking a limited form of diplomatic immunity known as consular immunity for the 47 Israelis in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. This would provide protection only for activities directly connected to a person's official functions, not for all crimes. But according to officials quoted in Monday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, this would be sufficient to shield from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosecution a foreign national suspected of involvement in the illegal export of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military technology. Responding to the Post story, <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has been trying for 18 months to get diplomatic status for dozens of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> representatives of various ministries, including defense, economics and tourism. <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said so far <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has refused because these officials are not working out of the Israeli Embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We are not only speaking about the guys in the military purchasing office,'' <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said. `` It also includes people from the ministries of tourism and economics. These people have been sent over by the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and they are not given full diplomatic status. It's a matter of principle.'' According to to <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> request poses `` legal and diplomatic'' problems about how the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government should deal with purchasing office employees suspected of seeking to smuggle American military technology out of the country. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are opposed to the Israeli request. The newspaper said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in July 1986 sought to investigate eight Israelis in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> suspected of the illegal export of machinery needed to manufacture cluster bombs. The department concluded last spring that it lacked sufficient evidence for criminal prosecution. Another case last November involved a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> company that paid fines of $ 750,000 for violating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export laws by smuggling equipment and technology to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the manufacture of chrome-plated cannon barrels. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the exact role of the Israeli purchasing office was never made clear.

<HEAD>Despite Renovation, Kids Can't See Animals At Zoo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some exhibits in the children's section of the Lincoln Park Zoo are so flawed youngsters ca n't even see the animals, despite a $ 2.5 million renovation, zoo officials said. The main problems are in the new outdoor otter and raccoon exhibits, where a natural-looking rock wall was built as a safety barrier to separate the children from the animals, said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhlir </PERSON>, director of engineering for the district. `` None of the kids can see over the boulders,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher-Yellen </PERSON>, who recently took her 3-year-old daughter to the zoo. `` I saw 20 or 30 kids climbing on those boulders,'' Ms. <PERSON> Fisher-Yellen </PERSON> said. `` No question there are sight-line problems for little kids,'' said zoo Director <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. `` I'm 6-foot-1. I can look in, but if I were 4 feet, I could n't. You just had to get down on your knees and know this is n't workable.'' Zoo officials want the architectural firm that designed the exhibits, <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Beeby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Babka </LOCATION>, to correct the problems. The architects said the plans were approved by the Park District, which owns and operates the zoo, and by the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a private, non-profit group that helped fund the renovation. Neither the architects nor the zoo knew how much the changes would cost.

<HEAD>GAO Report Says 500 Regulators Earning More Than Allowed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 500 federal savings institution regulators have been illegally exempted from government salary limits, according to a congressional report released Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, in a report for Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., said employees of three subsidiaries of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> are, in fact, federal employees and should be subject to civil service pay classifications The top civil service salary is $ 75,500 a year. The bank board, which regulates the nation's 3,000 savings associations, has set up the three subsidiaries since 1972, in two of the cases specifically to get around salary limits. Top executives of the subsidiaries are paid six-figure salaries. The Office of Regulatory Activities was created in 1986 as the Office of Regulatory Policy, Oversight and Supervision, or ORPOS, to formulate regulations and to oversee S & amp; L examiners that work for the 12 district <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>. It has 146 employees. The district banks serve as a central banking system for the savings and loan industry and are outside of the federal bureaucracy, but the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said regulatory office employees took over functions previously conducted by the board itself and should be considered part of the federal government. A second subsidiary, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, was set up in 1985 to dispose of billions in dollars of loans and foreclosed real estate from failed S & amp; Ls. It is the largest of the three with 313 employees. Its president, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, is a former head of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which manages government property, and a former political fund raiser for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He is paid $ 150,000 a year. The third entity, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>, has 52 employees and was formed in 1972 to oversee the issuance of debt to fund the bank board and the district banks. `` We believe the bank board acted improperly in creating ORPOS, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> as entities whose employees are not subject to the salary limitations,'' <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Socolar </PERSON>, special assistant to the comptroller general, said in a letter to <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>. According to bank board officials, the effects of forcing the three subsidiary agencies to abide by the salary caps is potentially devastating. Analysts in part blame the S & amp; L industry's problems on the inability of the bank board in the early 1980s to pay enough to attract experienced examiners By placing the examiners outside of salary caps, the bank board has been able to build up its staff, in part by hiring examiners away from other banking agencies. The report for <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, chairman of the federal services, post office and civil service subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is the latest blow against <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>, which has been criticized by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as both too slow and too expensive. Banking legislation approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> earlier this summer would abolish <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>, forcing the bank board's insurance fund to reassume the disposition agency's <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, a spokesman for the bank board, said agency officials believe it will take court or congressional action to enforce the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> findings. He contended that if the findings were enforced, many of the employees would be hired away by big accounting firms and financial institutions. `` We feel its important that we keep and retain these people. To lose that kind of talent, particularly in the regulatory area, would be devastating,'' he said. <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said about a dozen of the 500 employees in the three subsidiaries are paid more than the top salary within the federal civil service. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, in a statement released with the report, also complained that the three subsidiary agencies are exempt from federal conflict of interest and procurement rules. `` Something is drastically wrong. ... We have created a monstrous bureaucracy with almost no oversight by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. These officials `` do n't seem to have to comply with federal conflict of interest laws or federal salary caps. Yet they have the decision of life or death over hundreds of these institutions.''

<HEAD>Argentine Unions Hold 24-hour General Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Schools, public buildings and factories closed Monday across <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> as the 3.5-million-member organized labor movement held a 24-hour strike. The strike, set to end at midnight, was called to protest police actions at an anti-government rally Friday in front of Government House in which 113 people, including 37 policemen, were injured. Government officials said the police moved in Friday to stop fighting between rival union groups. Labor leaders denied that and accused the police of brutality. Monday's strike was the 13th organized by the General Labor Confederation since the elected government of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> was installed in December 1983, ending nearly eight years of military rule. The union federation had rejected a government request to call off the strike, and <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s centrist administration pledged over the weekend to protect anyone who wanted to work Monday. No violence was reported. Guards were posted at public buildings. Supervisors ran the subways in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> and owners of taxis and inner-city buses were encouraged to take shifts behind the wheel when most drivers failed to show up for work. The General Labor Confederation, backed by the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, organized last Friday's rally and an 8-hour general strike to protest <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s economic policies. Inflation registered 440 percent over the last 12 months, with unemployment and underemployment at a combined 14 percent, near 14-year highs. Real personal incomes have declined for three straight years. The labor federation claims that an anti-inflation plan <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> implemented last month does not allow workers' wages to keep pace with increases in the cost of living.

 The pilot of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner hijacked by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> terrorists in 1985 testified Monday that <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> took pleasure in torturing the passengers and fired the shot that killed an American sailor. Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON>, who commanded the plane during the ordeal, told the court he believed <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was the more violent of two hijackers who invaded the jetliner's cabin and later killed <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver. But under questioning by defense lawyers, <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> said he did not actually see <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> pull the trigger. In a related development in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Shiite Moslem kidnappers freed West German hostage <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> at midnight Monday after declaring that they were ending his 20-month ordeal in response to Syrian and <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> intervention, a Lebanese government official said in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A statement purporting to come from <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' kidnappers said earlier that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Hazef </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> `` guaranteed'' that the problem of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, also jailed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on terrorist charges, will be resolved. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was convicted of complicity in kidnapping <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and another West German in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to try to force the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government to free his younger brother. The other German, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, was released earlier. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is charged with murder and air piracy. He has admitted being one of the hijackers, but has denied killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. The Athens-to-Rome flight was hijacked June 14, 1985. It was flown to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed, and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> testified had testified earlier that either of two hijackers could have led <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> to a cabin door where he was shot. But after a recess, <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> told the court he had a chance to get a closer look at <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. `` I want to make an important statement,'' <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> said. `` I did say before that one of the two -LRB- hijackers -RRB- appeared to do more of the communicating and the other more of the violence.'' He said, `` It appeared that one of the hijackers -LRB- <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> -RRB- enjoyed beating the passengers more ... to inflict violence. `` Looking at this man now, I was struck that ... this is the man who I recall had stood in the forward entry way and shot <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>.'' Asked if both hijackers had dragged <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> to the doorway, <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> said: `` It could have been, but as I said before I am recalling from memory.'' `` It was my recollection that the most violent of the two men was in the companionway. I was in extreme stress and not taking notes of these details. It's only recollection,'' he added. The plane landed in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, was refueled, and flew to <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. It took on fuel and returned to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was slain and 39 other passengers were taken off the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 and held hostage. After the plane landed in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> the second time, <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> told the court, one of the hijackers talked to the airport tower in Arabic. `` I could tell the hijacker was becoming more and more agitated. He began screaming into the radio. At this time he turned toward his accomplice and screamed what appeared to be an order,'' the pilot said. `` The forward cabin door was open. I saw the other hijacker push <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> out the doorway. Then I heard a single shot,'' <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> told the court. After <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> finished his testimony, the judge asked <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> if he had anything to say. He replied through an interpreter: `` There are some things that are being lied about here.'' He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in 1987 after explosives were found in his luggage. <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> said he first realized there was trouble aboard Flight 847 when he heard banging noises from behind the cockpit door shortly after the plane took off from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. `` There was knocking and also strong kicking at the door.'' He said the co-pilot looked through a peephole in the cockpit door and exclaimed: `` We have been hijacked.'' <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> said co-pilot <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Maresca </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> saw a man brandishing `` a chrome-plated pistol.'' `` At that moment, our purser called over the intercom and said they -LRB- the passengers -RRB- were being mishandled. Not wishing them to be mishandled, I directed my flight engineer to open the door,'' the pilot testified. He said the men burst into the cockpit armed with the pistol and two hand grenades. <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> said he was not beaten, but that his flight engineer, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, was repeatedly struck with the pistol on the head and shoulders. `` Blood was coming from his head and from his shirt,'' said <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON>. He said the hijackers continued to beat the engineer and passengers even after the hijackers' demands to fly to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> were met. `` There was no reason for any of the beating because we were complying with their demands,'' <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> told the court. The pilot, who lives in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said he believed the men had been trained well for the mission and that they were familiar with the cockpit. Last week, two former hostages also told the court that the hijackers, including <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, brutally beat passengers before <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed. American <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, testified that he believed <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was the leader of the hijackers because `` he was giving the orders.'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> testified that he was also beaten by the hijackers.

<HEAD>Mortar Shells Fired at Parliament Building</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three mortar shells were fired Monday at the parliament building, deepening the crisis caused by the stalemate among Christians, Moslems and leftists in selecting a new president. Hours later, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> announced that legislators would be summoned to meet Sept. 22 for another attempt to elect a successor to Christian President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. Police said there were no casualties from three 60mm mortar shells that exploded at 6:45 a.m. around the two-story parliament building, known as <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON>. The building is in the no-man's land between predominantly Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> It was the first attack on Villa Mansour in two years. Police said one shell hit the entrance of <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> and the other two exploded near army and police checkpoints guarding approaches to the building. They said no group claimed responsibility and they did not know if the attack was linked to the electoral deadlock. Right-wing Christians and Moslem and leftist factions backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> quickly blamed the others for the shelling. Legislators had met Aug. 18 in an attempt to elect a successor to <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, whose six-year term expires Sept. 23, but some Christians boycotted the session and there was not a quorum, meaning the selection could not proceed. Under the constitution, the president can not seek a second consecutive term. The boycotting Christians opposed the main candidate, Syrian-backed former President <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>. By tradition, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s president is a Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> a Shiite Moslem. Failure to elect a new president would leave a political vacuum that many fear could reignite the civil war that has been mostly dormant for 18 months. It could not be determined if <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>'s announcement of a new electoral session indicated an agreement between Moslems and Christians on a consensus candidate. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> said the Sept. 22 session will be held in the old parliament building, in the Moslem sector's battle-scarred Place de l'Etoile. Legislators have used <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> for parliamentary sessions since they were forced out of the Place de l'Etoile in 1976, in the early days of the civil war. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> did not say if he changed the venue for the session because of Monday's mortar attack. The Syrians continue to support <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, 78, president from 1970 to 1976. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Edde </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> who has been living in self-imposed exile in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> since 1976, announced his candidacy shortly after <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> set the date for the new session. Parliament Secretary <PERSON> Ihsan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> said <PERSON> Edde </PERSON> announced his candidacy in a telephone call to <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Edde </PERSON>, 73, fled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> after three assassination attempts against him. He has been the front-runner among the two dozen presidential aspirants, including <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, in recent public opinion polls. Rightist Christians claim that <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> would turn <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> into a Syrian satellite. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, maintains 40,000 military personnel in eastern and northern provinces and west and south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>'s Moslem and leftist backers say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> prevented his election because he advocates an unconditional withdrawal by the Israelis from their self-designated `` security zone'' in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982 and established the buffer zone after withdrawing most of its army in 1985.

<HEAD>Panel Urges EPA to Focus on Preventing Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> must focus on preventing pollution instead of concentrating on cleaning up existing problems with an `` end of pipe'' strategy, a report provided Monday recommended. To help carry through such a change, the agency's research budget should be increased by about $ 375 million a year _ roughly doubled _ said a committee of the agency's <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in the report. The study was made available by agency officials Monday after an article about it appeared in The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. The committee was responding to a request for advice from <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who, the report said, `` sensed that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s immediate regulatory needs were driving its research and development efforts, while longer-term research equally important to achieving <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s overall risk reduction goals was being neglected.'' <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Alm </PERSON>, former deputy administrator of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the high-level advisory committee, said in an interview that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> was correct. `` The problem <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has is it's spending most of its R & amp; D dollars just putting out legislative fires,'' <PERSON> Alm </PERSON> said, referring to research and development money. `` One of its major problems is to look ahead, to anticipate problems.'' `` Obviously you need technical support for the regulations -LRB- but -RRB- ... that has driven virtually all the long-term research away,'' he said. The report said that in the 1970s, efforts to control automobile, industrial and wastewater pollution using `` federally mandated end-of-pipe controls were sensible, targeted, relatively efficient and reasonably cost effective.'' Though cleanups have been predicated on the notion that `` the polluter pays,'' and those controls will still be important, strategy must change, the report argued. `` For one thing, we are discovering environmental contamination in our homes _ e.g., radon _ and in the statosphere _ e.g., chlorofluorocarbons _ that are not emitted by ` pipes' in the traditional sense,'' the report said. For another thing, end-of-pipe control has too often shifted pollution from one place to another, for example, from water to air for toxic pollutants removed from sewage streams by aeration techniques. `` Whenever possible, environmental protection efforts first should be aimed at minimizing the amount of wastes or pollutants generated. Thus waste reduction at its source _ for example, through product design changes, industrial process changes or material substitution _ should be a primary objective,'' the report said. <PERSON> Alm </PERSON> said he believed many businesses would welcome a vigorous program of `` technology transfer'' led by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> _ a program to show them how their processes could be changed to generate less waste. `` The private sector has ... an incentive through liability questions,'' <PERSON> Alm </PERSON> said. To help keep the need for long-term research in view, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> should convert the position of assistant administrator for research and development from a presidential appointment to a career job, the report argued. In the 18 years for <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s existence, no one has held the job for more than three years, and `` no leader ... has stayed at the agency long enough to implement a sustained, long-term research strategy,'' it said. Ecological research should get more emphasis, having taken a back seat to research to support regulations aimed at protecting human health, the report said.

 An American engineer who was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> overpowered his captors and escaped to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Monday with the help of Syrian troops, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> radio and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. A source close to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> confirmed the American was delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, but he said the engineer was rescued by <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> troops who found where he was being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and overpowered the kidnappers. The discrepencies in the reports could not immediately be reconciled. All three reports said the engineer was abducted Sunday by unidentified gunmen in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after he married a Lebanese woman. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> refused to comment on the story, but officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> identified the engineer as <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> and said he works in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> was taken captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as he was leaving his wedding reception. They said his Lebanese bride was detained briefly. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> subdued his abductors after several hours, reached a Syrian army checkpoint and was escorted to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, where he was turned over to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official, the officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. The officials said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>' mother reportedly lives in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. According to one published report, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> is 25 and his wife, <PERSON> Samia </PERSON>, is 32. He is said to hold a black belt in karate. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, who confirmed much of the account of <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>' experience, expressed gratitude to <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> authorities for their assistance. He said the episode underscores the dangers American citizens face in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where nine Americans are held hostage. The Voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which is run by right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militias, said the bridegroom `` who excels in karate'' subdued three gunmen, who were armed with automatic rifles, disarmed them and took refuge at a Syrian army post. The Syrians then drove him to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the radio said. The gunmen intercepted the newlyweds a few hours after the wedding, the radio said. The Syrian source, who also demanded anonymity, said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and married <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Haydar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharafeddine </PERSON>, a girl, whose family lives in <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> was kidnapped after the wedding near his bride's home. After a long search, Syrian troops located the couple, freed them from the gunmen and took them to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, where Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharaa </PERSON> turned them over to <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, the source said. The Sharafeddines are a well-known Shiite Moslem family in <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION>, a stronghold of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, is an extremist <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> group that is believed to be an umbrella for various factions holding 18 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Army Suspends Deliveries of 9mm Baretta Due to Slide Mechanism
Cracking</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: SUBS 13th graf to correct Colt .45 to pistol sted of revolver</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and Italian gunmaker <PERSON> Beretta </PERSON> have reached an agreement to suspend deliveries of the military's new 9mm pistol for the next three months to deal with a problem of unexpected cracking in the gun's slide mechanism, the service said Monday. The latest halt to deliveries _ the second in nine months _ will last from September through December, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reitz </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. By January, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> expects Beretta to resume production and deliveries of the 9mm pistol after making modifications to the slide mechanism. The delay in deliveries was worked out during a meeting Aug. 17 between <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Beretta </LOCATION> officials, with the company accepting the move `` at no cost to the government,'' the spokesman said. The Army insisted on changes to the weapon's manufacture after an incident in July in which a pistol slide cracked unexpectedly during training firings and sent fragments back toward the shooter's chest. It was the fourth such cracking incident over the past year. Beretta and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> have now agreed the metal pistol slides for the gun will have to be forged using an improved heat process to ensure their strength and the guns fitted with a device to capture any slide that does crack. `` It was agreed that August production quantities would be accepted without the modified slide and components, pending formal approval of the engineering change proposal,'' said <PERSON> Reitz </PERSON>. `` Deliveries with the new slide mechanism will resume in January 1989.'' The spokesman said <PERSON> Beretta </PERSON> also had agreed to retrofit the pistols already delivered with the new mechanisms after completing its production run. The company has so far delivered more than 140,000 pistols of an order for 316,000. The Army first stopped accepting deliveries of the handgun last November because of an unexpected cracking problem with the pistol's frame. <LOCATION> Beretta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of the Italian arms maker <ORGANIZATION> Armi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beretta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, subsequently devised a manufacturing solution to that problem earlier this year and resumed production. In the meantime, though, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> had started investigating why slide bolts on the Berettas were cracking. The first such incident occurred late last year. The latest decision to halt deliveries was reported Monday by the trade publication `` Defense Week'' and subsequently confirmed by <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of Beretta declined immediate comment on the matter. <LOCATION> Beretta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, which operates a manufacturing plant in <LOCATION> Accokeek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, beat out seven competitors in 1985 for the right to provide 9mm guns to replace the military's venerable Colt .45 - caliber The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has designated the pistol the M-9, is serving as the executive buying agent for all the services and awarded Beretta an initial contract worth $ 75 million. The latest problems arise at a time when <PERSON> Beretta </PERSON> has entered a congressionally ordered competition with the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> gunmaker <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Wesson and several other interested American gunmakers to supply the next batch of 9mm pistols. The American firms had protested the 1985 award to a foreign company. The slide bolt on the Beretta is thrown backward after a shot is fired as part of the process of chambering a new round. Army officials disclosed last May that <PERSON> Beretta </PERSON> had blamed the slide failures on the use of special ammunition, but that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was not prepared to accept that explanation.

 <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, founder, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, announced Monday he wo n't run for re-election to the company's board of directors and is passing full command to his daughter The company said in a statement that <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> is expected to be elected to the posts her father holds at a board meeting Nov. 10, set to follow <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 shareholders meeting. Ms. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, 35, now is the company's president, chief operating officer and vice chairwoman. `` I think in terms of the company overall _ it is a changing of the guard, a sort of passing the reins along,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Robyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Radomski </PERSON>. `` In terms of where the company is now, it's a logical step. ... But <PERSON> Hef </PERSON> is still going to be editor-in-chief of the magazine and be involved in major strategic decisions.''

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, trying to counter Republican attacks on his defense views, made an unusual pledge of support Monday for the Stealth bomber but ran into boos from workers at a plant where engines for the airplane are manufactured. A <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> adviser said afterward he believed there was no difference between his position and that of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the bomber. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> visited the large <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> plant outside <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> after a stop in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> where he charged that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` unforgivably wrong'' in the Iran-Contra affair and questioned whether his opponent has `` the steadiness required in the Oval Office.'' Beginning a campaign week devoted largely to defense and foreign policy matters, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got cheers but also boos and chants of `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' from some in the crowd of 1,000 when he spoke inside the GE plant. He stood in front of military and commercial jet engines and referred to the Stealth bomber, the radar-evading aircraft that has been shrouded in secrecy during planning and early stages of production. `` That bomber was started by a Democratic administration; it was supported by the Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and it's going to be completed under my administration,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who was accompanied by <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' speech was not interrupted by the protesters, thanks in part to a booming amplification system that allowed him to speak easily over the shouts. Many supporters in the crowd chanted `` Duke, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'' to help drown out the dissenters. Those booing were in a minority. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' unqualified statement of support for the Stealth bomber appeared to go beyond earlier campaign statements that he supported continued research of the project. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> issues adviser <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was committed to deployment of the aircraft provided `` it is affordable and it works,'' and said that did not represent a change in position. `` He says we need it and he intends to deploy it,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. He asserted `` I do n't believe there's a difference'' between the positions of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the Stealth. Earlier in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that as vice president <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had produced only failure in combating drugs, cracking down on international terrorism and dealing with the imbalance in foreign trade. `` In each of these three areas, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has failed,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` No wonder he does n't want to debate.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s representatives agreed to a tentative schedule for two debates in recent days, half the four meetings <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had sought. The Democratic presidential candidate delivered the first of what is to be three defense and national security addresses this week to an invited audience of 200 union members and other supporters in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been stung by weeks of criticism from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Republicans, who have painted him as weak on defense issues and in opposition to a range of new weapons systems, including virtually all proposals for new land-based nuclear weapons. Press secretary <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' visit to the GE plant was aimed at showing that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` is for the Stealth bomber, despite what his opponent has said.'' In his <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> continued the tougher, more aggressive stance against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that he first displayed last week in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, although he provided few new specifics about his own national security views. He sharpened his now-familiar attack on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for keeping silent when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agreed to sell missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in exchange for the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` I do n't question <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s patriotism, even though these days he seems to be questioning mine,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Not for a minute. But does this man, a man who would encourage the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to undermine American interests and prestige by selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have the judgment and the steadiness required in the Oval Office?'' The reference to patriotism was a response to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s repeated digs at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for vetoing a state bill aimed to requiring public school teachers to lead their classes in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he was advised the bill was unconstitutional. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> bungled the patriotism line Monday, saying: `` I do n't question <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s terrorism.'' He quickly corrected himself. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> focused his criticism of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on three areas he said were crucial to national security, and heaped scorn on <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate, as unqualifed to oversee the government's anti-drug efforts as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had. `` I want to beat our foreign competitors; he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- is willing to settle for second place,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I want to crack down on terrorism; he knuckled under to the Ayatollah. I want a real war against drugs; his answer to drug kingpins like -LRB- Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> questioned why the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration proposed sharp cuts in federal aid to state and local drug agencies while imports of illicit narcotics were soaring. He demanded that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> explain why the government had friendly dealings with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, despite allegations the Panamanian leader was involved in drug trafficking, and accused the administration of `` blocking a congressional investigation into when and why and how much we paid <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` obviously does n't know what he's talking about.'' He said the Democrat `` quite obviously does n't believe that tough law enforcement provides a deterrent,'' and he reiterated the ticket's call for the death penalty for drug `` kingpins.''

<HEAD>Mayor Says He Won't Run For Fifth Term</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, a leading Hispanic politician who once was considered a potential vice presidential candidate, said Monday he's been in public service long enough and wo n't seek a fifth term. `` It's been work and it's been fun. Mostly, it's been the most engrossing and fulfilling thing I've ever done,'' said <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, 41, whose term expires next spring. `` Basically, I've been at it for 14 years _ eight years as mayor and six as council member. That's a long time to go at full throttle,'' he said. `` Our country believes that eight years in a high office should be enough to get a job done. `` Presidents serve eight years. Governors serve eight years. And eight years is a good round number for a mayor, especially this one,'' he said. Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> interviewed <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> in 1984 about possibly running on his ticket. <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> also has been mentioned frequently as a possible Cabinet-level appointee. Last year, <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> said he would not seek a statewide office because he wanted to devote time to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> projects and to his son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, who was born with a congenital heart defect and with stomach abnormalities. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION>, turned down an offer to make a keynote address to the Democratic National Convention. <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, who has met Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, was approached earlier this year by several <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> businessmen about the prospect of forming a firm to handle business investments. The mayor's salary is less than $ 5,000 and <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, with two adolescent daughters and an ill infant, had supplemented that income with lectures, columns and speaking engagements. <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> said he needs a different job because his two daughters are approaching college age and because the medical expenses for his son are sure to increase. `` Today is a little sad for me. It has to be,'' <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> said. `` But I expect to wake up tomorrow morning, ready to make the most of the next eight months, same pace, same energy, same devotion to the city until midnight of the day before the next mayor takes office.'' During his tenure, the bilingual, charismatic mayor helped attract numerous conventions and businesses to the city, including Sea World of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the largest marine life theme park in the world. <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, who won his last two elections overwhelmingly, also helped attract numerous Hispanics to the polls, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Brischetto </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` He certainly has the charisma to turn out the Hispanic vote, and I think the city contest without him is going to be a different contest,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is facing huge debts, lagging food production and a soaring infant mortality rate despite broad economic and social reforms, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief, speaking at the opening of a two-week review of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Africa Recovery Program, gave a grim prognosis for the continent. Among the signs of distress he cited: _ Infant and child mortality rates are rising, and are projected to reach 50 million in the period 1985-2000 In every other world region, infant and child mortality is rapidly decreasing. _ By the year 2010, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s debt will be more than 280 percent of its total export income _ Per capita income on the continent fell 2 percent in 1986 and 2.2 percent in 1987, and today is lower than it was in 1980 _ Agricultural production improved by 3.8 percent in 1986 but only 1.1 percent in 1987, despite agricultural policy reforms <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s report marks the midway point of the 1986-1990 Africa Recovery Program, the result of a special <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session in May 1986, the first such session to focus on one continent. The program was aimed at helping reverse <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s economic decline, but external problems have blocked substantial progress, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said. He said three key problems are <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s depressed export earnings, the cost of repaying its debt and insufficient financing. `` Every day that passes, the debt burden of African countries becomes even more excruciating,'' said <PERSON> Adebayo </PERSON> <PERSON> Adedeji </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary-general. Although <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> paid almost $ 1 billion a year to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> in loan costs in 1986 and 1987, resources fell, exports credit declined and loans from the private sector were minor, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief's report said. <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s debt burden `` has become one of the most important factors constraining recovery and development on the continent, and unless urgent action is taken, the situation will worse,'' said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s total external debt is estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> at $ 218 billion by the end of 1987, almost triple the continent's export earnings. A slump in commodity prices has further hurt <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s economy. Particulary damaging are the sluggish markets for oil, minerals, cocoa, coffee, and tea. These problems largely canceled out any gain that might have been produced by the `` courageous and commendable'' sacrifices of some African governments, such as adopting steep currency devaluations, cutting budget deficits and an turning over some public sector functions to the private sector. `` In many countries such measures involve social costs and political risks,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> noted. Most African nations have embarked on economic restructuring programs, about 30 percent of them with the backing of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most countries are giving greater priority to channeling resources to agriculture, to improving incentives for farmers, to making provision for food security and to combating drought and decertification,'' the secretary-general said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nations to continue these restructuring programs, but cautioned them to ensure that `` the most vulnerable groups in society are protected from adverse consequences.'' Donor countries should show their support for these reforms by increasing their aid, he said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> called on industrialized nations to reduce their agricultural subsidies on products competing with African commodities. `` African efforts to pursue and deepen the reform process can not be sustained indefinitely in the face of an adverse external environment and without increased support from the international community,'' the secretary-general said.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approved 18 ministers Monday in a vote of confidence for Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>'s government, but rejected three, including Revolutionary Guards Minister <PERSON> Mohsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafiqdoust </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said The two-day debate exposed the deep divisions in the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hierarchy that had largely been masked by the need for unity during the 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The veto on <PERSON> Rafiqdoust </PERSON> underscored the anger over disastrous battlefield defeats suffered by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> before it abruptly accepted a year-old <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Nations-sponsored cease-fire July 18. These setbacks had been blamed on the Revolutionary Guards. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> began observing a truce Aug. 20 and started U.N.-mediated peace talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> five days later. The parliamentary debate, which <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> announced in July, opened Sunday amid a deepening rift between hardline revolutionaries demanding economic isolationism and tight state control of the economy and rivals, such as House Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who seek to open up oil-rich <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the postwar era. Several deputies attacked hardliner <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>'s economic policies, while radical legislators loyal to the premier defended his administration. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, gave few details of Monday's session But the radio said the 11 ministers of the 21-member Cabinet who were cross-examined by the 270-member Majlis, or parliament, included Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, Oil Minister <PERSON> Alireza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON>, Heavy Industry Minister <PERSON> Behzad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabavi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rafiqdoust </PERSON>. Besides <PERSON> Rafiqdoust </PERSON>, Education and Training Minister <PERSON> Kazem </PERSON> <PERSON> Akrami </PERSON> and Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zali </PERSON> also received a no-confidence vote. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> will have to choose three new ministers to replace them. The fact that other close allies of <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> won the vote of confidence indicated that a head-on clash between radicals and conservatives over <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s postwar economic policy has been averted, at least for now. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, prime minister for seven years, warned Sunday that a vote of no confidence in his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> would seriously hamper <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s postwar recovery <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, 46, submitted his resignation to President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> on Sept. 5, saying he believed at least eight of his ministers faced no-confidence votes. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> rejected the resignation and <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the 88-year-old revolutionary patriarch, publicly rebuked <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> for making the surprise move at such a critical juncture while <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was negotiating a peace settlement with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> retracted his resignation, but complained of `` difficulties in the decision-making process in the executive,'' an apparent sideswipe at his rivals, <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s intervention put off any major political crisis in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But analysts believe the end of the war will bring profound changes in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and that <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> could be among the political casualties. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> reportedly opposed a truce. He opposes allowing foreign multinationals back into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to help with the massive task of reconstruction. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> favor a more moderate course and ending <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s self-imposed isolation. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> on Monday opened <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s 14th international trade fair, in which 36 countries were participating. Some, like <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, were taking part for the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution toppled the late, pro-Western <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said other foreign participants included the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted Commerce Minister <PERSON> Abdulhussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Vahaji </PERSON> as stressing that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> welcomes foreign technological assistance for reconstruction projects and said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> now seeks to expand commercial links with the rest of the world. Some Western analysts have estimated that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s postwar reconstruction could cost $ 40 billion.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in his first public appearance after a six-week vacation, ran into crowds complaining loudly about food shortages and living conditions Monday in the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>. The evening television news program `` Vremya'' led its evening program with a report on the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader's trip to the city, about 2,000 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had been out of public view since July 30, when he met with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Soviet officials said he was on vacation. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> asked for support for his reform policies as residents of <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> pressed close to him and complained about lack of hot water and long lines for meat, sausage and other foods. The clamor was in marked contrast to the usual orderly scenes of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visits on Soviet TV. Many of the comments and complaints were inaudible. `` The most important thing is that you believe in our politics and in the leadership that is still being formed. It's still being formed at the regional and provincial levels,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. He told the residents he was not interested in blind faith, but in reasoned trust for his policies and the people implementing them. `` We're on the right path, comrades,'' he said. `` No need to get lost. We're on the right path.'' The Soviet leader blamed both local and national officials for failing to develop social services in <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>, and reiterated that he is committed to providing each Soviet family with a separate apartment by the year 2000. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> on a special <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> plane and met with residents near the airport, and again near the city's central square, where he laid a wreath at a monument to Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> He defended his tolerance of greater debate and criticism in the Soviet press and encouragement of cooperatives outside the state-run economy. One woman complained that cooperatives, owned by the people who run them rather than by the government, charge too much for their services. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> agreed that cooperative prices are high, but told the woman that as more co-ops are formed competition will drive prices down. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has encouraged cooperatives to provide goods and services that are in short supply in the state-run economy. A man complained that under his policy of glasnost, or greater openness, the state-run press is free to attack anyone by name, whether they deserve it or not. The Soviet leader responded, `` We need openness, we need glasnost, but it has to be according to our values, according to socialism and according to people.'' No indication emerged how long <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would remain in <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>, the regional center for an area that takes in one-tenth of the entire <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> also is the site of a Soviet radar station that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says is an obstacle to arms control negotiations. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not discuss the radar site in comments distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency and shown on Soviet television.

 A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 broke a nose wheel on landing at <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Monday and skidded between two runways, and at least one passenger suffered a minor injury as he was evacuated, an airport spokesman said. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said the incident occurred shortly before 2 p.m., and that the plane was still between two runways after passengers were taken off via escape chutes. The plane was flight 225, which originated at <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and made a stop in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> before landing at <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION>. Witnesses who said they saw the plane land told KCNC-Channel 4 that the craft came in with its nose high, and that the wheel collapsed as the nose moved down at a landing angle. One passenger injured an ankle while sliding down the chute, <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said. `` The plane carried 197 passengers and 10 crew members,'' said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON>, media relations manager for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> at its <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> offices. `` All passengers were safely evacuated after the plane left the side of the runway,'' she said. Skies were overcast and the runways were wet, but the weather was not believed to be a factor in the accident, <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet observers came to this Central Asian city Monday to prepare for the first <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear test monitored by American experts, a step toward ratifying two long-pending arms treaties. Arms negotiator <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation, said it had been `` a long journey, but an even longer journey in the mind'' to reach the point at which the two superpowers are willing to share some of their most closely guarded technology in the interest of arms control. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> spoke before setting off by bus across the steppe to the Soviet test ground. An American team of up to 40 specialists has worked at the site since April, drilling a hole 2,100 feet into the earth to plant a measuring device the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government calls the most sensitive gauge of nuclear explosions. A test blast, to be detonated Wednesday, is similar to one exploded at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> test site on <LOCATION> Pahute </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, on Aug. 17. The devices are being set off to allow each side use its own testing equipment and compare the results with those of the other side to determine the strength of the blast and the accuracy of the monitoring techniques. The joint experiments are expected to lead to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification of two long-dormant treaties limiting underground nuclear explosions to 150 kilotons, still many times more powerful than the bomb that devasted <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. A kiloton is the equivalent of the explosion of 1,000 tons of TNT. Those pacts _ the Threshold Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1974 and a similar accord signed in 1976 to limit peaceful nuclear explosions _ were bypassed by President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who pressed instead for a comprehensive ban on all nuclear testing. His successor, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, shelved the unratified documents, claiming the Soviets regularly violated their limits without permitting on-site verification. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> unsuccessfully sought for 18 months to cajole the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into joining a Soviet moratorium on all nuclear tests. It abandoned the effort last February and agreed to go along with joint verification of tests as a step toward its goal of a total ban. `` No one thought even a year ago that what is about to happen could happen,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said Monday. He called the joint verification experiment `` a real triumph of confidence-building'' on both sides. Detailed results of last month's test have not yet been released. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, speaking on condition they not be identified, have expressed considerable satisfaction with the results. Reports have surfaced that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> measuring gear, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contends is more accurate than Soviet methods, showed that the American test exceeded the 150-kiloton limit. But officials said Monday they regarded that possibility as `` very, very unlikely,'' noting that even with its much-heralded accuracy the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> measuring device can be 30 percent off.

 An Ecuadorean domestic airliner crashed Monday shortly after taking off from a jungle airport, killing all seven crew members, the Civil Aviation press office said. The agency said the craft, belonging to the domestic airline TAME, was carrying no passengers when it took off from an airstrip at <LOCATION> Lago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Agrio </LOCATION>, an oil town in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle, 105 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION>.

A press statement said the plane, an <LOCATION> Electra </LOCATION> with capacity for 97 passengers, was still low in the air when it tipped sideways, plunged to the ground and burst into flames. The plane's destination was <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION>, according to the Civil Aviation office. TAME, a military-run commercial airline, serves cities within <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. It was the second air crash in less than a week in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>.

 Israeli troops shot and wounded seven Palestinians in clashes Monday, hospital officials said. The army bolstered security throughout the occupied lands to head off violence during the two-day Jewish New Year. In <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, merchants said they would set up a militia of about 25 Palestinian guards to replace the city's <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> police officers, most of whom quit on orders from underground uprising leaders, municipal secretary <PERSON> Hathem </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakri </PERSON> reported In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, troop gunfire hit three <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-agers, including a 14-year-old boy who was seriously wounded in the abdomen, acording to hospital officials. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s Jabaliya and Shati refugee camps, troops fired on stone-throwing youths, wounding four, other hospital officials reported. The army confirmed one casualty and said it was checking the others. Elsewhere, youths blockaded streets in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, set tires ablaze and hurled stones at Israeli settlers' cars, witnesses said. At least 264 Palestinians and six Israelis have died since violence began on Dec. 8 in lands <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> war. The army freed 75 Palestinians jailed without trial in a <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert prison camp. An army spokesman said it was a humanitarian gesture on the occasion of <LOCATION> Rosh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashana </LOCATION>, the Jewish New Year. That brought to 150 the number of Palestinians freed over the holiday, which began at sundown Sunday and lasts through sundown Tuesday. About 2,500 Palestinians are jailed without trial at the desert tent prison at <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION>, about five miles from the Egyptian border. <PERSON> Bakri </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>'s new Palestinian guard was the first of its kind to be set up in the occupied territories and would be financed by <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> business people, many of whom suffered break-ins after most city policemen resigned. `` The purpose is to guard markets and businesses because there have been a lot of robberies, costing merchants hundreds of thousands of dollars. We need such a body and it was formed on popular demand,'' <PERSON> Bakri </PERSON> said in an interview. He said the guards would carry knives, clubs and walkie-talkies, but that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities would not let them carry guns. Uprising leaders have ordered all Palestinians who work for the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military government in the occupied territories, including police, to quit their jobs. The army reinforced patrols and set up checkpoints on main highways throughout the occupied lands. Troops searched Palestinian cars at roadblocks outside <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Kalandia </LOCATION> refugee camp in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> reported extra troops deployed in Arab areas of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, but said no clashes occurred. In one incident, a Jewish settler fired in the air after his vehicle was stoned in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, but no one was injured, witnesses said. Dozens of supporters of the left-wing Progressive List for Peace, a mixed Arab-Jewish party that holds two seats in the 120-member Israeli parliament, demonstrated outside the northern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> to protest last week's army raid in which more than 200 <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists were arrested. Demonstrators carried placards calling on soldiers to refuse service in the occupied lands, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said. Secular Israelis meanwhile gathered throughout <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for picnics in beaches and backyards Monday to mark the Jewish New Year, while observant Jews symbolically cast off their sins by throwing the contents of their pockets into springs and streams. Mainly because of the Palestinian uprising, police deployed thousands of officers in <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> cities and urged residents to be on the lookout for suspicious objects. At the <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Gedi </PERSON> nature reserve, attendance was down markedly from last year, apparently because many Israelis shied away from the swing through the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> necessary to reach the <LOCATION> Dead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. But hotels in the northern port city of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> were fully booked, and 120,000 visitors were expected at the nearby <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> over the holiday. Tens of thousands of Israelis flocked to synagogues to listen to rams' horns, or `` shofars,'' heralding the new year 5749. <PERSON> Rosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashana </PERSON> is both a joyous and solemn holiday during which Jews begin a 10-day period of atonement for sins of the previous year. Most shops and restaurants were closed, all public transporation was halted, and the normally bustling centers of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> were deserted.

<HEAD>$10 Million Suit Claims Horror Mistress Elvira a Vampira Rip-Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Horror movie hostess <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON>, queen of the macabre on late night TV, is accused in a $ 10 million lawsuit of pirating her campy pin-up character from another sultry horror mistress. `` The character was ripped off,'' attorney <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said Monday. Ms. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> filed a lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last week on behalf of <LOCATION> Maila </LOCATION> `` Vampira'' <PERSON> Nurmi </PERSON>, who contends actress <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> `` Elvira'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> infringed upon her trademark, public reputation and ability to market her lucrative character. `` Hopefully, my client will be fairly compensated and <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> will continue with her character and share the proceeds with my client,'' Ms. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Nurmi </PERSON> created the Vampira character in the 1950s, combining sex appeal, humor and death as TV fright movie hostess, the lawsuit said. In 1981, executives at KHJ-TV asked her to revive `` The Vampira Show.'' Instead, the lawsuit contends, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Nurmi </PERSON> was eased out after turning over details pertaining to the image and persona of her character, and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> was installed as host of the syndicated `` The Elvira Show.'' `` There is no <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON>. There's only a pirated Vampira,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Nurmi </PERSON>, 65. `` <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> slavishly copied my product and made a fortune. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has been duped.'' In addition to <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, defendants include KHJ-TV; <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Panacea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Elvira </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> KHJ </ORGANIZATION> withheld comment pending receipt of the lawsuit, but <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said there was nothing indicating wrongdoing by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> He said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> denies violating the rights of Miss <PERSON> Nurmi </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is to air the upcoming movie `` <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON>.'' `` As we have not yet been served nor officially informed of this action, we decline comment at this time,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, spokesman for Miss <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, Panacea and <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON> <PERSON> Merchandising </PERSON>.

 An F-14 fighter jet crashed upside down into a hangar at a suburban airfield Monday and exploded after two crewmen ejected. The fliers and three people on the ground were injured, officals said. `` It just dropped,'' eyewitness <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Janes </PERSON> said of the plane. `` It was a sea of flame after that. ... But I did n't hear any screams for help.'' The jet from <LOCATION> Miramar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> crashed into the hangar at <LOCATION> Gillespie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> on the northern edge of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION>, 15 miles east of downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, officials said. The blaze destroyed the hangar and an attached extension, but spared a nearby restaurant. At least six cars and three or four planes parked on the ground were burned. The $ 35 million F-14, the fighter jet glamorized in the movie `` Top Gun,'' experienced mechanical problems and the two crewmen tried to guide it to the runway at <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> before bailing out, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and civilian police officials said. The jet did not carry any ordnance, they said. `` The pilot was trying to get it to hit the airport runway,'' steering clear of the residential and business areas surrounding the airfield, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McClurg </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> crewmen and three people in or near the hangar were injured, <PERSON> McClurg </PERSON> said. Lt. j.g. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Furtado </PERSON> was listed in critical condition at <ORGANIZATION> Sharp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pooley </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, trying to turn back charges of `` McCarthyism,'' scorned presidential rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> anew Monday as a liberal Democrat and `` a card-carrying member'' of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not did not directly answer <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' charge that Republicans were attacking his patriotism, using the tactics of the late-Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> Speaking to a crowd of several thousand people at a shopping center rally, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` Recently, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> accused me of McCarthyism. `` And it was suggested that when I said he is a card-carrying member of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> that that was McCarthyism; when I say he's a liberal, that it's unfair.'' `` No, he's that -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a member of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He says's he's that. He's that. I am the vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a partner in -LRB- the -RRB- administration that has turned this economy around, that has put <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> back to work, that has strengthened our national security and that has enhanced the peace.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no mention at the rally that five more members of an ethnic coalition supporting his campaign had resigned under fire. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters: `` Nobody's giving in. These people left of their own volition. We're not accusing anybody of anything. `` We're getting into a very peculiar deal where some people are accusing people. I do n't like it a bit.'' Earlier, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> challenged his opponent to say whether he supported the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on military issues ranging from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack against <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. `` If my opponent ca n't answer yes to all these important questions, then I would submit to you that he has veered outside the bipartisan mainstream, the vital consensus that has been at the heart of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s national security for many, many years,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. On the other hand, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should answer `` yes'' then `` the people are entitled to know why he flip-flopped. And, perhaps most important of all, how will we know he wo n't change his positions again.'' Returning to the campaign trail after a weekend in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hammered <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on defense and economic issues while courting Cuban-American votes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` I have just been told that my opponent is ending his so-called ` Stealth' candidacy,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, quoting his own description of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign. He commented during a tour of <ORGANIZATION> Goya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, which bills itself as the nation's largest privately owned Hispanic firm. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> still regarded the Strategic Defense Initiative as a fantasy, as he once said, and whether <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was willing to admit `` that your support for a nuclear freeze was a mistake.'' Before touring the plant in <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> raised some of the same questions in a <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, speech before a flag-waving Cuban-American audience of upwards of 1,000 people. Beginning the day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced formation of a national security advisory task force whose 13 members include former Secretaries of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretaries <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, who was national security adviser to <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, joining <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference, said that of the two candidates for president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` is not a novice in that critical area of public policy on which our national survival depends.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his Cuban-American audience: `` I take great personal pride in the fact that three of my grandchildren are half Mexican, are Hispanic. You see, my family is doubly blessed. We have both cultures in my family.'' Referring to the invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, which at the time was strengthening its ties with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and the bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` And I will really admit that I am having trouble pinning down the liberal governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> on his defense. He's all over the field. So my question of the day: Does he support the attack on <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> that has resulted in less international terror and does he support the attack on <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> that has given those people the freedom and democracy that sometimes we take for granted?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> foreign policy adviser <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supported the invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> for the purpose of rescuing students, if their lives were threatened. He said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's motivation to invade was `` clearly more than'' a desire to rescue the students. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said `` there was legitimate basis for taking some action against <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>,'' including action against terrorist camps, but not bombing the tent where <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was believed to be. `` What he does not support is the targeting of a head of state,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said.

 A huge bomb placed in a taxi blew up outside City Hall on Monday, injuring eight people who did not have enough time to flee after a telephoned warning, police said. Earlier Monday, two bombs set by guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> badly damaged the home of Sir <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloomfield </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s civil service. <PERSON> Bloomfield </PERSON>, 57, his wife and a son were not injured but were treated for shock. The blasts ripped holes in the brick house and shattered windows in neary homes. A third bomb near the house was defused by British army experts, police said. Police said that in <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION>, 35 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, demolitions experts defused a 500-pound bomb found near the Drumsill Hotel. Press Association, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic news agency, said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the blast outside <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> that shattered shop and office windows over a large area of downtown <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. The agency did not say how it obtained its information on the claim of responsibility. Police said two of the injured were in serious condition. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> had carried out a car bombing on Aug. 24 only 150 yards from the site of Monday's blast. Last month's explosion caused more than $ 6.75 million in damage. In a statement, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION> house attack in <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Down </LOCATION>, on the eastern outskirts of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, and said other civil servants in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> should resign their posts. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, said, `` This is the first time we have had a direct bomb attack on civil servants working in the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Office and it is a matter of great concern to us. It just shows the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> are now after civilians.'' The taxi bombing stirred concern that the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> might be returning to the `` commercial war'' of the 1970s that devastated the city center. The mainly Roman Catholic organization is fighting to drive the British from the Protestant-majority province and unite it with the Catholic Irish Republic. The bomb went off between two office buildings in <LOCATION> Donegall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, about 70 yards from City Hall. It was planted inside a black taxi parked in a cab rank. A police spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British practice, said that 11 minutes before the explosion a telephoned warning was made to the Irish News newspaper. The spokesman said it was very short warning time. Forty bus drivers were taking their break in a nearby cafeteria minutes before the bomb went off. `` A policeman ran in and shouted that a bomb had been planted outside,'' said a driver, who refused to give his name. `` Most of us managed to get away but some of my colleagues were hit by flying glass.'' A second driver, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said he had parked his bus and the passengers got off seconds before the bomb exploded. `` I saw at least three drivers stagger up the road injured from flying glass. One of them looked in quite a bad way and they were all suffering from shock,'' he said. `` All I can remember is the force of the blast ... I have heard explosions before but this one sounded like a really big one,'' he said. Police swiftly sealed off the area to keep hundreds of people still leaving their offices from getting near the site, as shattered windows continued to drop shards of glass onto the sidewalks. British and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> officials are scheduled to meet Tuesday under terms of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement that give the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government a consultative role in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province. The meeting was requested by Irish Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> to discuss the worsening security situation.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Six people claimed in a radio broadcast Monday that they took part in a massacre at a Roman Catholic church that left at least five dead and 77 wounded, and warned that the slaughter `` was child's play.'' The five men and one woman later appeared on <PERSON> Tele-Haiti </PERSON>, the country's only private television station. In both broadcasts the six said the bloody attack Sunday was aimed at Rev. <PERSON> Jean-Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, the church pastor and a critic of the military government. One of the men said in the Radio Metropole interview, broadcast Monday evening, that `` the people committed the massacre. `` We were after Father <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>; what you saw yesterday was child's play. In whatever parish <PERSON> Father </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> is accepted, a heap of corpses will attend that Mass,'' the man said. None of the six was identified. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Widmaier </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION>, said the group came to the station Monday afternoon and claimed participation in the massacre at the church and the stoning later Sunday of two other radio stations and the headquarters of two opposition leaders. During the television appearance, one of the men said the slaughter at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> was motivated by an internal struggle between <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> and another priest, but they did not elaborate. Two dozen men with guns and machetes burst into the church during a morning Mass in the La Saline slum and shot, stabbed and slashed terrified parishioners, witnesses said. Witnesses said at least a dozen people were killed. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> escaped unhurt and went into hiding. Doctors at the general hospital of the state university reported five bodies were in the hospital morgue and 77 parishioners were hospitalized. Among those injured were a woman and her infant _ both skewered by the same steel pike while the baby girl was in her mother's womb An operation saved mother and child. <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> was `` justly punished.'' But <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, compared it to attacks on civilians that occurred during the rule of dictator <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> `` Papa Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> and his son, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON>. `` This act is unprecedented in our history,'' <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> said. `` Even <PERSON> Papa </PERSON> <PERSON> Doc </PERSON> did not dare do such a thing _ penetrate the holy precincts of a church and, after massacring unarmed worshipers, burn it down.'' Dr. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Blot </PERSON>, who took part in surgery that saved the baby and mother, told Radio Haiti-Inter the sharpened metal rod penetrated the woman below the heart and wounded the baby. He said 10 others required emergency surgery, one for a bullet wound and nine who were stabbed by skewers, a common homemade weapon in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. The rest suffered from various injuries, having been shot, bludgeoned, trampled or slashed. Witnesses speaking on condition of anonymity said Monday they spotted <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> city hall employees among the assailants, but did not identify them. Witnesses said police and soldiers watched the attack but did nothing to stop it. <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>, a former army colonel and police chief during the 29-year <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> era, denied the charge. `` If -LRB- city -RRB- employees were involved ... I do n't see how I am concerned ... I am not an anarchist, I am not someone who preaches violence and who sends people out to die as <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> has always done,'' <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> said. `` Father <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> has always preached violence ... He who sows the wind, reaps the storm,'' <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, one of the most popular figures among the poor masses in this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation, regularly has preached against army atrocities and has led his supporters in street demonstrations. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> has been the target of several assassination attempts since Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> came to power as head of a three-man junta on Feb. 7, 1986, the day <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled into exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> mayor until <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>'s ouster, returned to that office in army-run elections in January and remained after <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ousted civilian President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> in a military coup in June. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> was head of the military under the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> regime. The mayor was a member of a firing squad in the Nov. 12, 1964, execution of two survivors of `` Young <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>,'' a group of U.S.-based anti-Duvalier activists who invaded the country. <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> personally shot and killed two group members. `` On Sunday, -LRB- the forces of law and order -RRB- stood by ... and let a massacre take place,'' <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> said. The radio reports said police and soldiers looked on from an army compound across the street as 300 assailants stoned the church. A smaller group of men armed with machetes, sticks and guns then entered the church and began attacking worshipers. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> condemned the police behavior. `` In spite of the fact that all of these attacks occurred in close proximity to various police and military installations, no actions were taken by the competent authorites to intervene while the attack were taking place,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, who lives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, denounced the incident as the work of <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s secret police. `` Brute force is the principal instrument of those who now control the country,'' <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> said from his home in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. `` It is the same killers of the Duvalier time organizing the new terror.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Says Bush Has Failed; Bush Challenges Dukakis on Military</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: UPDATES and EDITS throughout to include Bush comments on
McCarthyism charge; poll results.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> charged Monday that an unsteady <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> botched his assignments in the battle against drugs and terrorism, while the Republican nominee challenged <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to state his views on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strike against <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also scorned presidential rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> anew Monday as a liberal Democrat and `` a card-carrying member'' of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Speaking to a crowd of several thousand people at a shopping center rally in <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred to a recent charge by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had engaged in McCarthyism, a reference to the vigilante tactics of the late Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. `` Recently, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> accused me of McCarthyism,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And it was suggested that when I said he is a card-carrying member of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> that that was McCarthyism; when I say he's a liberal, that it's unfair. `` No, he's that. He says's he's that. He's that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no mention at the rally that five more members of an ethnic coalition supporting his campaign had resigned under fire. The vice president's `` <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalities </ORGANIZATION>,'' lost five of its members when they resigned Monday in the wake of charges of anti-Semitism and Holocaust revisionism among some of its officials. The controversy arose after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Jewish Week reported that some of the five had ties to anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi movements and apparent neo-fascist associations. The resignations came one day after <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appointee to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, stepped down after a published report said he tallied the number of Jewish employees at the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> while serving in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration. The most recent poll, meanwhile, puts <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a virtual dead heat among registered voters. The CNN-USA Today poll released Monday night indicates that 48 percent favor <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to 46 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The survey of 1,260 certain voters last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Gordon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> had a three-point margin of error. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, launching a three-day counteroffensive against <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> charges he would cripple American defense and foreign policy, told 200 supporters at a union hall in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` disastrously and completely and unforgivably wrong'' for not warning President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> against selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an attempt to free hostages. Later, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ran into some boos when he visited a GE plant in <LOCATION> Evendale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, that makes engines for the Stealth bomber. He told 1,000 workers that work on the radar-evading aircraft began under a Democratic administration and `` it's going to be completed in my administration, you can count on it.'' But some workers booed and chanted `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' One sign read, `` Keep your job, vote for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' unqualified statement of support for the Stealth bomber appeared to go beyond earlier campaign statements that he supported continued research on the project. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> issues adviser <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was committed to deployment of the aircraft provided `` it is affordable and it works,'' and said that represents no change in position. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would restore respect for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which he said had been undermined by Reagan-Bush failures to combat terrorism, come to grips with the trade deficit and stop `` the avalanche of drugs ... pouring across our borders.'' `` I want to beat our foreign competitors; he's willing to settle for second best. I want to crack down on terrorism; he knuckled under to the ayatollah. I want a real war on drugs; his answer to drug kingpins like -LRB- <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at a news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and later at a rally before 1,000 flag-waving Cuban-Americans in <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, cudgeled <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on defense and foreign affairs as well as the economy. `` I will really admit that I am having trouble pinning down the liberal governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> on his defense,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> demanded that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spell out whether he supported the 1986 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and the 1983 invasion `` to free <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> from its Cuban masters.'' If the answer is no, he said, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would show himself to have `` veered outside the bipartisan mainstream'' on national security issues. He also asked whether <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would admit `` that your support for a nuclear freeze was a mistake.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had his own questions for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, ranging from the Iran-Contra affair to why the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration cut funds for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and aid for state and local drug agencies while it put `` General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on its payroll.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment on drug trafficking charges. `` What kind of judgment is this?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked. `` What kind of priorities are these? ... We need better leadership from the next president.'' Earlier Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> named a panel of national security advisers including former Secretaries of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> as well as <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, who was Democrat <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s national security adviser. Introducing <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his objective was `` to shape a foreign policy built on the principles of bipartisanship ... realism, strength, dialogue and engagement.'' <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has been tested in the international arena and he has a wide-ranging grasp of international realities. He's not a novice in that critical area of foreign policy on which our national survival depends.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has opposed the MX and Midgetman missiles and has called the Strategic Defense Initiative a fantasy, although he emphasized last week he would continue basic SDI research at a reduced level. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, touring a plant and addresing a <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said that if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wins, `` his hand'll be back in your pocket'' and the Democrats will `` return us once again to those chilling days of no growth'' under <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. His counterpart, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, spent the day in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attending to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> duties.

 <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, that country's chief negotiator in deadlocked negotiations over the future of strategic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in the islands, is to meet here Tuesday with senior <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, who arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the weekend, would talk with <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs, followed by meetings with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, Deputy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> was scheduled to open a series of talks with congressional leaders, and on Friday he was to speak at a meeting in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Proposed payments of hundreds of millions of dollars a year separated the two governments when <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> in late July suspended an ongoing review in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> of future <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use of <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> air base, <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> naval station and four smaller installations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. A report from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> had insisted on a $ 1.2 billion annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payment for use of the bases after the current agreement expires in 1991. Various reports said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, now paying about $ 180 million a year, offered substantial increases that, however, fell far below the reported demand. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials also continued to object to describing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid payments to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> as compensation or rent for the bases, maintaining the arrangement was part of a defense package with many mutual advantages. They also said the breakoff of the talks was temporary. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> side called it an indefinite breakoff because of what <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> described as an inflexible <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> became well known in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> when he lived here in exile during the administration of ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> before returning to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> to join President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government.

<HEAD>Controversial School Dropout Program Revised</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE SILVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A controversial program that paid potential dropouts to go to class has been revised this year because of negative attention it generated, school officials said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> received national attention last year when it began paying problem students $ 5 a day, or $ 25 a week, to attend classes regularly, be punctual, do their homework and behave themselves. `` It was picked up by the media as ` Oh, my God, you're paying kids to go to school,''' said Principal <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nogueira </PERSON>. He said the concept was viewed as `` almost un-American.'' Critics said the program was unfair because it paid some students to achieve what were minimal requirements for the rest, and violated the ideal of education being an end in itself. Officials denied the students were being paid to study. Instead, they said they were getting `` needs-based'' subsidies for improving their academic performance and changing their behavior. National television crews came to the school, students were interviewed on the radio and newspapers reported on the program. `` There seemed to be a lot of hoopla going on about how we were doing it,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lock </PERSON>, a work placement coordinator at the school who helped draft this year's program. `` The attention being paid to it was taking away from our time rather than being with the young people.'' This year potential dropouts will be paid $ 4 a day for attending a one-hour program outside regular class hours, school officials said. During the hour, which may be before or after classes, they will receive tutoring and help with homework, get counseling on their attitude toward school, and prepare for the state high school proficiency tests. The test is required in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to receive a diploma. `` This is fairer because the student has to come in the hour before or the hour after school, which is a good commitment to make,'' <PERSON> Lock </PERSON> said. `` We think it will accomplish similar goals but not attract the type of attention the other -LRB- program -RRB- seemed to attract.'' Students will be required to complete the program requirements five days in a row to receive the all-or-nothing weekly payment. The revised program will be trimmed back considerably, with the budget slashed from $ 108,000 to $ 50,000, <PERSON> Nogueira </PERSON> said. The funding comes from a federal grant under the Job Training and Partnership Act. <PERSON> Nogueira </PERSON> said less money was budgeted because not all those eligible can be persuaded to participate. Last year, for example, only 48 of 130 targeted students took part. An analysis also found the program is not appropriate for students with especially high absentee rates or disciplinary problems, <PERSON> Lock </PERSON> said. Despite the controversy, officials said the program was a success. At the end of the school year, 70 percent of the 48 participants had passed the high school proficiency test. `` We're not suggesting this is the way for everyone to go but we do know financial incentives are part of our culture,'' <PERSON> Nogueira </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Monday ordered <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s ambassador and third secretary to leave the country because of a shooting incident involving the junior diplomat, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced. No casualties were reported officially and police gave few details about gunshots at a building in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and the arrest of Third Secretary <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. Press Association, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic news agency, quoted a witness as saying one person, who was not identified, was wounded. The Daily Mail said <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> opened fire because he believed he was being trailed by an assassination squad. It did not give attribution for its report. Foreign Office Minister <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggar </PERSON> told Cuban Ambassador <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez-Mell </PERSON> that he and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> must leave <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> by midnight Tuesday. A Vietnamese diplomat left <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> Sunday, expelled for brandishing a handgun during a demonstration earlier this month by refugees outside the Vietnamese Embassy. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> moved quickly against the Cubans. A Foreign Office statement said: `` We understand from the police that at about 4:30 p.m. -LRB- 11:30 a.m. EDT -RRB- today -LRB- Monday -RRB- an incident occurred in <LOCATION> Sussex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, W2, when a number of shots were fired by a man subsequently identified as a third secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Senor </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> has indicated to the police that he fired the shots fearing for his own safety.'' The statement reported `` Mr. <PERSON> Eggar </PERSON> said that this incident could not under any circumstances be justified. The British government would not tolerate the use of firearms by diplomats. Mr. <PERSON> Eggar </PERSON> said that the ambassador must bear the responsibility for this grave development. `` The only appropriate response was that he must insist that the ambassador and <PERSON> Senor </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> should leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> as soon as possible, but at the latest by midnight tomorrow.'' Fernandez-Mell, summoned to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Eggar </PERSON>, said before going into the meeting, `` I do n't know what happened. There was some trouble in the hall of a man's house. Some men attacked him -LRB- <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> -RRB-. But I do n't know anything about a gun. It was just a little problem.'' The ambassador made no comment when he left after a 20-minute meeting. <PERSON> Eggar </PERSON>, speaking to reporters later, said he told the ambassador `` behavior of the kind that went on this afternoon was simply not acceptable.'' Police headquarters at <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard made only a brief report. It said police were summoned when there were reports of shots being fired and when they arrived, `` a foreign male surrendered himself and a gun and he was immediately arrested. `` It is alleged he fired a number of rounds at persons nearby who immediately dispersed.'' `` On arrival at <LOCATION> Paddington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> police station the man claimed he was entitled to full diplomatic privilege and once this was established he was released,'' the police report said. Press Association and the Daily Mail gave these accounts: The newspaper said <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> drew a gun as he stepped from his car outside a building where the Cuban Embassy has an apartment in <LOCATION> Sussex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, believing men in another auto were about to open fire. `` He fired at the group, who were thought to be Arab or Hispanic,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The men scattered and the envoy fired at one as he ran near a passing bus ... The men escaped and the Cuban fled into the block of flats -LRB- apartments -RRB- ... and barricaded himself in the official ... apartment.'' It said a Diplomatic Protection Squad arrived from <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard and cordoned off the area. Two police officers negotiated with the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> diplomat from an adjacent balcony and used a mirror on a pole to look into the apartment to see if any other gunmen were inside, according to the Daily Mail. <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> fired up to five shots at a car containing four people. It quoted an unidentified witness as saying she saw the four run away, with one holding a blood-soaked handkerchief to his head. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has strict gun laws and most police officers do not carry firearms. The issue of diplomats possessing weapons became extremely sensitive after the killing of a policewoman by a gunman firing from inside the Libyan Embassy during a protest demonstration outside the embassy in April 1984. After a police siege, the embassy was closed and diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> were severed. Vietnamese Third Secretary <PERSON> Khang </PERSON> <PERSON> Than </PERSON> <PERSON> Nhan </PERSON> was expelled and left Sunday after he was accused of brandishing a gun during a demonstration by Vietnamese refugees at the Vietnamese Embassy on Sept. 4. The Vietnamese ambassador first turned over a toy gun, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said, but later returned with a real gun and apologized for the incident.

 Two Afghan warplanes were hit over <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> by missiles fired by U.S.-made Pakistani F-16s and were believed to have been destroyed, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. A ministry statement said the two planes were among six Afghan aircraft that intruded in Pakistani airspace with the aim of bombing targets here. `` Search for the wreckage is in progress for final confirmation -LRB- that the two planes were destroyed -RRB-,'' the statement said, adding that all Pakistani planes returned safely. The ministry said, `` Six Afghan aircraft on Monday violated the border of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Nawagai </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Frontier </LOCATION> province with the intent of bombing our territory.'' Nawagai is 120 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, and 12 miles from the Afghan border. `` Two <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> air force F-16 aircraft intercepted the raiders and engaged two of the Afghan aircraft with air-to-air missiles at high altitude. `` All video and electronic sensors on board the F-16s indicate positively that the two intruders were hit by missiles.'' The statement gave no further details. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> also claimed last Wednesday to have downed an intruding Afghan plane after several Afghan warplanes were engaged by Pakistani F-16s. The ministry also put the scene of the engagement then as <PERSON> Nawagai </PERSON>. But state-run Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> called the Pakistani claim `` baseless'' and `` a lie.'' It challenged <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to produce the wreckage. <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> failed to do so. If verified, the Wednesday and Monday claims would make a total of six warplanes shot down by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> since the guerrilla war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> began. Those include a Soviet-piloted Su-25 warplane which <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> shot down over its territory Aug. 4. The Soviet pilot, Col. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Vladimirovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudskoi </PERSON>, was captured, but was handed over to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on Aug. 17. Relations between <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> have suffered since late 1979, when Soviet troops marched into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to support <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s pro-Moscow government. Thousands of anti-communist guerrillas have fought the Soviet troops and Afghan forces since then. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> accuse <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of aiding the guerrillas militarily. Half of the 115,000 Soviet troops have left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by the stipulated date of Aug. 15, under U.N.-brokered <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords signed last April 14. The remaining troops are to leave by next Feb. 15. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> signed the accords as a step toward bringing peace in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Earlier Monday, guerrillas were reported to have taken two key border garrisons in southeastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in a series of communist defeats there. Guerrillas and Western diplomatic sounces said the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government moved thousands of troops to the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> to shore up defenses sagging from weeks of guerrilla onslaughts. `` Reports we have received concerning the regime's situation in -LRB- southeastern -RRB- <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> indicate that the position of the regime is deteriorating,'' said one Western diplomatic source in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> has long been seen as a key element in the insurgents' drive to capture provincial capitals as Soviet forces withdraw The guerrillas claim they overran the border garrison of <LOCATION> Spin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boldak </LOCATION> after a two-month siege last Friday, capturing many weapons and large amounts of ammunition. The following day, guerrillas claimed a similar victory farther up the border at <LOCATION> Khair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kot </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paktika </LOCATION> province, also a key supply route. The guerrillas, known as mujahedeen, or holy warriors, reject all offers for a political settlement with the communists. They have taken two provincial capitals this summer: Talogan in the north and <LOCATION> Bamyan </LOCATION> west of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. They also briefly held the key northern city of <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> before heavy Soviet aerial bombardment forced them to flee. The guerrillas also repeatedly penetrated <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s fortress-like defenses to launch a series of blistering rocket attacks in recent weeks. On Sunday, a large car bomb exploded on a main shopping street near the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Embassy, killing 10 people and wounding about 40.

<HEAD>Gold Boom Brings Money to Impoverished Area in Philippines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Six years ago, <PERSON> Macario </PERSON> <PERSON> Galero </PERSON> made a modest living by farming coconuts and operating a small food shop. Today, he is one of the `` high graders'' exploiting a gold boom in this small coastal town and has moved up the ladder of affluence. Officials estimate that as many as 20,000 people are involved in gold mining or prospecting here in <LOCATION> Camarines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION> province. More than 100,000 others work the mines in <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION> province, northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Masbate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and other areas of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Gold had been mined in Camarines Norte since before World War II, in the hills overlooking the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in this town of about 25,000 about 120 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. But in December 1952, a mine cave-in here killed 56 miners and brought a halt to large-scale mining operations. The town's source of livelihood reverted to fishing and coconuts, and many young men sought work abroad. In the early 1980s, however, the rise in the world gold prices rekindled interest in mining and triggered a `` gold rush'' here and other areas of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` I think it was a gift from God that they found gold here,'' said <PERSON> Pepito </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, the town judge. `` Because otherwise, the people would be suffering. Before gold, there was nothing but fishing.'' About six major mining corporations, including <ORGANIZATION> Benguet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Abcar-Paragon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, operate in Paracale and nearby towns. Officials at Abcar-Paragon, which employs about 300 people, declined to give details of their operation. But local engineers estimate the <LOCATION> Philippine-Australian </LOCATION> joint venture is mining about 500 tons of ore a day. In general, refiners can extract about 4.5 grams of gold from each ton of ore, for a total daily yield from the 500 tons of about 2,250 grams, or 78,75 ounces. At current world prices, that much gold could fetch around $ 34,000, depending on the quality. Mining sources believe the company's claim includes veins with an estimated richness of 14 grams per ton, making it one of the country's richest reserves. But much of the mining here is done by `` high graders'' _ independent prospectors who scour the riverbeds and sink deep shafts in the hills in hopes of a strike. Although few are getting rich by world standards, most are earning more than they would by fishing or harvesting coconuts. <PERSON> Galero </PERSON>'s operation is typical of the `` high graders.'' He owns the land and finances digging operations in return for a share of whatever the prospectors find. Startup costs, including tools, generators, refining equipment, chemicals and food, run from $ 500 to $ 1,000, mining sources said. Like other `` high graders,'' <PERSON> Galero </PERSON> declined to say how much he has earned. Much of the gold is sold on the black market to avoid taxes. Some miners say they are afraid jealous rivals will jump their claims if their profits are made public. But <PERSON> Galero </PERSON> said that in April, his crews were mining ore with a richness of 15 grams of gold per ton, a rich find. Fifteen grams would fetch about $ 226 at world prices. Some engineers say small-scale `` high graders'' in <LOCATION> Camarines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION> average up to one gram of gold a day. Miners in <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION>, a larger operation than those in <LOCATION> Camarines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION>, receive as much as $ 225 a week, more than 10 times what a farm worker normally earns in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. With his profits, <PERSON> Galero </PERSON> has been able to build a stone house in a neighborhood where others live in huts of coconut leaves. His home includes a color television set and a video, luxuries in this area. `` Certainly, it's meant more money for the people,'' said banker <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. `` We've noticed an increase in deposits, because people are directly benefited by the boom.'' At one site, atop a jungle ridge south of town, about 50 miners dig at three shafts, each 50 to 100 feet deep and about five feet square. From the base, tiny, crawl-space tunnels fan out toward hoped-for veins. Miners descend into the pits on makeshift rope pulleys, working for about an hour before returning to the surface for a respite from the heat below. Laborers on the surface haul up the ore in large sacks, then transfer it to `` milling stations,'' where the stones are ground into powder in gasoline - or diesel-powered cylindrical drums Mercury is added to the powdered ore. The gold dust then sticks to the mercury and is separated from the ground stone. Gold mining has also spawned a number of other businesses, from vendors who sell miners soft drinks and fried bananas to jewelry smiths who buy gold from middle-men and then sell finished products as far away as <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. `` Most of our inhabitants are engaged in small-scale mining nowadays,'' said Vice Mayor <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dasco </PERSON>. `` The people are employed, and the number of business establishments is increasing.'' Local residents say that so far, Paracale has been spared the ill effects the gold boom has brought to <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION>. These include a sharp increase in armed robberies, slayings and scores of deaths due to cave-ins. `` This is not yet a problem because of family ties and religiosity of the people,'' said Rev. <PERSON> Efren </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, the local Roman Catholic priest. Still, he worries about the long-term effects of people getting `` quick money.'' `` When they get money, they spend the money,'' <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said. `` It's easy money, and they do n't think about the future.''

 With the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's Contra policy battered, the Contra rebels and the Honduran government look to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to accept responsibility for the failed effort to oust the Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> Thousands of Contras and their supporters streamed across the Nicaraguan border in the past four months into base camps in the rugged, pine-covered Honduran mountains. The Honduran government looks warily at a swell of armed foreigners within its borders and worries they could become permanent refugees. `` These guys have been fighting because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has given them economic and military aid,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Honduran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, said in an interview. `` If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suddenly pulls the rug, the ethical and moral responsibility is to take them to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The Contra combatants put the blame for their exodus on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which shut off military aid at the end of February. Non-lethal funding approved a month later specified that the supplies be distributed within <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` The aid has had more negative effects to our troops than the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. The Sandinistas never forced our troops out of the country,'' Contra spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> home. The Contras, backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since their formation in 1981, seek the ouster of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolutionary war that desposed dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> and gave <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> a leftist government. The rebels claim the peace process started in March with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> has failed. They profess a willingness to return to battle but say they can not face the Soviet-supplied Sandinista army without military aid. The rebels managed last year to stalemate the seven-year war along the nation's central spine. But they apparently lacked the popular support base to obtain food and clothes. A fragile truce that started with the March peace talks remains in place. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration favors renewed military assistance, but chances remain slim <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will approve it during an election year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains vague about its plans for the Contra fighters and supporters within Honduran terrtory. Both the Contras and the Hondurans express concern about the problems here becoming lost in other election issues. Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favors renewed military aid, while <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes it. `` We do n't see it in terms of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration,'' Contra spokesman <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said. `` We consider it in terms of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We want a clear policy from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which we have not had.'' One solution that the Foreign Ministry's <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> termed as `` absolutely out of the question'' was the possibility of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> allowing the Contras to obtain legal residency. `` We can not, we will not take them as residents,'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said. `` This is a poor country. We do n't have enough for our own people.'' The numbers of Contras in eastern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> vary. Interior Minister <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colindres </PERSON> recently put the figure of fighters at 12,000, while the rebels said there were about 10,000. The civilians were said to number 5,000 to 30,000, and <PERSON> Ortez </PERSON> <PERSON> Colindres </PERSON> said as many as 300 more civilians arrive daily. Almost 40,000 legal refugees from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> live in <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nations-run </LOCATION> camps. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> estimates that up to 200,000 others, mostly Nicaraguans, are in the country illegally. `` All we can do -LRB- for the Contras and supporters -RRB- is take them to refugee camps and seek help from a third country,'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> said recently the Contras present a `` serious problem.'' The armed forces expressed their concern. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, a staunch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, became the cornerstone for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's Central American policies. Tens of thousands of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops pass through yearly for military manuevers. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> ran the Contra training and resupply programs from <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> military bases. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, in exchange, received millions of dollars in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and military aid, although for years the government officially denied the presence of the Contras. The issue recently was highlighted, apparently with the tacit consent of the Hondurans, by the Contras, who ferried groups of journalists to the remote camps to show the plight of the fighters and the civilians. <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said the Contras seek military aid and not refuge. `` The bottom card is not a green card,'' he said in reference to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration card given to resident aliens. `` We are not begging to get into a refugee camp or to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>American Companies Scramble to Get Ready for 1992 in Europe</HEAD>

 American companies are scrambling to make sure they are not shut out of the lucrative new market that will be formed in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 1992. That's when the 12 nations of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- EEC -RRB- remove the many trade barriers separating them. `` We're living through a historic period in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It is all happening. You ignore it at your peril,'' said <PERSON> Eamonn </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> affairs manager for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. `` Every aspect of doing business in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is going to change.'' In response, top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies are opening special offices, reviewing business strategies and hiring consultants to get ready for the next decade when the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> becomes a single market of 320 million consumers. `` American companies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are taking the issue very, very seriously,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> di </PERSON> <PERSON> Pretoro </PERSON>, who recently assumed his post as senior vice president for <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> affairs for <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>. Many executives say the far-reaching changes, while spurring greater competition, should lead to reduced costs and bigger sales. `` You're going to operate in a much more difficult environment,'' said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Patron </PERSON>, government affairs manager for <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` -LRB- But -RRB- if you play your cards right, you will benefit substantially.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials, though, worry that the Europeans might use their newfound togetherness to try to keep out <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other foreign competition. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingon </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview, `` What I'm afraid of ... is that when the barriers come down, the competition among themselves is going to be so great ... that there will be an instinctive protectionist push.'' European officials might decide, he said, `` all right we'll open it up internally, but we'll have to limit it externally.'' `` They insist it wo n't happen,'' he said. `` I hope they're right. Community officials dismiss concerns they will create a `` Fortress <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' in 1992. `` These fears are totally unjustified,'' <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s top trade official, said in a recent speech. The idea of the European-wide market is to reduce the barriers that keep goods, services, people and money from moving freely among the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries: <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. They would, put simply, become more like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> where people and goods, with some exceptions, can travel freely from state to state. The Europeans have drawn up a list of 285 steps that need to be taken to remove physical, technical and fiscal obstacles to unity. Their deadline for completing the task is the end of 1992. So far, 92 of the measures have been adopted. The 1992 pace has quickened dramatically since February when <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> leaders agreed on measures to solve a long-standing dispute over the trading bloc's budget. With their money woes apparently out of the way, officials have turned their attention to fashioning the single market. Many big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies with strong European ties do not expect discriminatory moves against their operations but rather believe they stand to gain when the barriers are removed. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, external affairs manager at <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, cites such statements by <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> chief executive <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> as one made in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION>: `` Companies working inside the community will continue to be welcomed. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> conducts a share of its R & amp; D -LRB- research and development -RRB- in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. For us, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is a European company.'' `` We feel zero threat,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Telegdy </PERSON>, director of government affairs for <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. `` We feel we stand to gain and have nothing to lose by the European integration,'' Dow estimates the new <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will mean savings of roughly $ 50 million annually from, among other things, lower transportation costs, product standardization and simplification of accounting procedures. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials still voice concern about Americans being kept out. Deputy Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> recently cautioned the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, `` The creation of a single market that reserves ` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for Europeans' would be bad for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and for the multilateral economic system.'' `` We would find unacceptable,'' he said in a speech in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` measures that would limit market access for third countries and discriminate against foreign companies already established or that wish to establish in the community.'' <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crossick </ORGANIZATION>, senior <ORGANIZATION> partner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> L </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belmont </ORGANIZATION>, a Brussels-based consulting firm that counts top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies among its clients, said, `` To a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> player well-prepared and integrated in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the opportunities appear to exceed the threats.'' But, he added, `` the Fortress <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> question is of serious concern. We do n't want to hype it up _ that's a danger. But it could be a serious issue.'' A key concern, analysts say, is the growing use of `` reciprocity'' in <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> discussions about how much access foreign companies will have in sectors, such as financial services, not yet covered by international trade rules. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said in recent speeches that the test of reciprocity would be used when a foreign financial institution asks permission to operate in an EEC country. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` will check on a case-by-case basis whether similar institutions from all member states are given the same treatment in the non-community country concerned.'' `` If not,'' he continued, `` the authorization procedure will be suspended until we have ensured reciprocity by negotiating with the non-community country concerned.'' <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, vice president of corporate external affairs for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said the reciprocity issue could disrupt the financial markets now operating efficiently in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` If the community tries to do a lockout,'' he said, `` they risk cutting off their noses to spite their face.'' Foreign money, he added, could be driven out of the community to offshore banking centers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials want the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> to apply a standard of national treatment to foreign firms so that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and other operations will be treated in the new market just like <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> companies. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials also are concerned the community will extend to all 12 countries limits that a few have on imports of certain products and that it will bow to protectionist demands from special interests in fashioning commercial and industrial policies. `` This could result in new and greater discrimination in the areas, for example, of right of establishment, mergers and acquisitions, government procurement, subsidies, local content requirements and standards and certification,'' said <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Television Tunes Out Campaign Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Presidential race draws closer. Flashy, computerized graphic at 11. American television viewers may not be sure how the presidential candidates differ, but so what? With a quick glance at the set, they'll know who's ahead in the polls. Television news, especially at the networks, has a fascination with the horse race, not the horses. Polls and instant analysis clobber in-depth issue reporting. `` It's easier and quicker to deliver that kind of succinct information,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> political analyst <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON>. After all, there's only so much you can do in 5 minutes, about the time the three networks spend each night on the campaign. `` What television does well is brief, telegenic episodes,'' said columnist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Will </PERSON>. `` That's why television has traditionally had difficulty delivering economic news _ because you ca n't take a picture of supply and demand.'' Television's inability _ or reluctance _ to delve into the issues is n't new. But is it more of a problem this time around? For the first time in history, more than half of all Americans depend on television as their single source of information, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. In a campaign where precise contrasts between <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may be difficult to grasp, are charts, graphs and 10-second sound bites enough? Opinion, like the electorate, is split. `` It's not even a political campaign anymore, where political issues are discussed and people analyze the issues,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, director of the media watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting. The coverage `` reduces us to mindless fans instead of active citizens.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheatley </PERSON>, executive producer of `` NBC Nightly News,'' disagrees. `` It's a long campaign, and with 4 to 6 minutes a night, you can do a lot of reporting. It adds up,'' <PERSON> Wheatley </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think there's any doubt that the viewer gets enough information and a good idea of where the candidates stand on the issues.'' Who decides how television covers the election? It's a tricky question. Television viewers exhibit increasingly shorter attention spans and, armed with remote controls, wo n't tolerate a moment of boredom. Channels magazine reported in its September issue that a majority of 18 - to 34-year-old viewers with remotes in hand watch two or more shows at once `` You could certainly argue that if voters wanted to learn more about issues, then ` The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour' would beat out <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and Rather,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON>, co-director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. `` So a more issue-oriented news presentation is available on <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>, but few people take advantage of it. The mass of the public is not that interested in issues. `` If the network research departments came up and said, ` Wait a second! There's a market for issues!' then you'd see more of that coverage.'' A recent <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> study found that in 1,338 reports on this year's primaries, the networks did almost three times as many stories on campaign strategy and tactics _ the horse race _ than it did on campaign issues _ the horses. `` For all practical purposes, voters are interested in brevity,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, an associate professor of government at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` They have always been interested in brevity, and we have this romantic notion that at some point the voters were really actively involved in the process. They were n't.'' `` Those people for whom television is 80 percent of their news do n't want the whole picture,'' said Will. `` Why are they watching television? Because they are happy with that.'' Television has traditionally been a reactive rather than a proactive or anticipatory medium. Polls are news. Strategy sessions are news. Gaffes are news. How <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan to deal with the deficit ... well, that's something else. `` Even on ` Nightline,' where we have much more time than on the evening news, we're going to have a truncated discussion,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Greenfield </LOCATION>. `` On the evening news, you've got a minute-45 to do each campaign. ... What you're going to cover is ` here's what he said' in 15 seconds. ` Here's the latest poll. Here's their strategy.' `` Given the incredible difficulty of covering coherently a complicated policy debate, it is much easier to take what appears to be a quantifiable fact ... and go to the latest poll.''

Independent economists conservatively estimate that inflation will pass 500 percent this year. Two years ago inflation was 63 percent. `` The country is shipwrecked in a sea of paper money,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirinos </PERSON>, an independent. `` This is a horrifying perspective and never known before in our history.'' Consumer prices shot up 30.9 percent in July alone. Peruvians are trying to adjust. They say they eat less, work more and worry a lot. `` Now I have to buy less chicken. I use it first for broth and then stew. It's the only way,'' said housewife <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Alegre </PERSON>, while shopping in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s working-class La <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> market. Nearby, tennis shoes costing 500 intis early last year were selling for 3,000 intis, equivalent to about $ 25 or half the minimum monthly wage. Cigarettes, often sold singly because many Peruvians can not afford entire packs, cost 10 intis each or seven times the January price. Analysts are now concerned that <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s inflation could boil into four-digit figures next year. The middle class has begun renting spare rooms, tutoring, knitting and sewing piece work and selling home-cooked food such as meat-filled `` empanadas'' in streetside stands to make ends meet. But <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s poor, the vast majority of the population, have been affected the hardest. `` The poorest paid people in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> are earning less money than at any time since records have been kept,'' The Andean Report, an economic monthly, said in July. An old man begging in the shadow of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s downtown government palace complained recently that inflation was making him poorer. `` This fills up fast but the intis are worth nothing,'' he said, jiggling the dirty plastic cup he waves to passers-by. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, manager of an appliance store, said he telephones wholesalers every day to get revised prices for the television sets, stoves and toasters he sells. But business has been good, <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> said, noting customers have pulled cash from bank accounts where the annual interest is frozen at 130 percent to buy durable goods, whose value very well could rise in an inflation. `` The only option a saver has with his money is spend it,'' said the news magazine <ORGANIZATION> Caretas </ORGANIZATION>. `` Those who do not have the ability to save will simply have to seek a second job.'' <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, 42, a married accountant with three children, said he recently began moonlighting as a curbside money trader on `` Wall Street,'' the name given by Peruvians to <PERSON> Jiron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocona </PERSON>, a narrow downtown street where thousands of people every day now buy dollars as a hedge against inflation. He said many of his competitors are also professionals seeking to supplement inflation-pinched incomes with the small but quick profits offered by the dollar trade. Analysts say <PERSON> Jiron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocona </PERSON> is also a financial barometer, and the recent stampede for dollars reflects Peruvians' waning confidence in the government's ability to improve economic conditions. In a recent survey, Peruvians rated the economy as the No. 1 problem, replacing a vicious leftist insurgency that was ranked first a year ago. President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> imposed a ceiling on foreign debt payments on taking office three years ago and then used the money owed creditors abroad to finance a consumption-based economic reactivation that pulled <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> from its worst depression of the century. But heavy government spending with an expected deficit of at least 12 percent and a growing shortage of dollar reserves to subsidize imports have plunged the nation into recession this year. Manufacturing has fallen sharply, while speculation in consumer and industrial goods is rampant. Prosperity reflected by well-stocked stores two years ago has now been replaced with repeated and prolonged shortages of medicines, auto parts and basic foods, such as milk and sugar. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a populist whose term ends in 1990, recently installed a `` war economy,'' aimed at holding down wage increases while allowing prices to rise. But economists maintain the measures are not sufficent and predict inflation will continue to soar. `` When inflation hits 500 percent, it could very easily get out of hand,'' said one leading independent economist, <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON>. `` This is my biggest concern. There will be a very high social cost and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is not a stable country.''

 <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YORK </LOCATION> _ Stringent security on the one hand and a trusting openness on the other mark the dealing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s exotic Diamond District. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> was an outsider who proved remarkably successful in that environment _ until that day when she was murdered and the $ 500,000 in diamonds she had been carrying disappeared. It's a story worthy of a movie plot.

 In <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s tradition-bound <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> was different _ a young Italian-American Catholic woman in an industry dominated by Jewish men, an outsider who went to school for the expertise more often passed down through families. But it is not <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON>'s success in the diamond business that its denizens will remember. <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON>, 33, disappeared Feb. 4 along with more than $ 500,000 in diamonds, the day after a proposed sale fell through. In June, her body was found in the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>; she had been bludgeoned to death. Only one of the six missing jewels has been recovered. `` She was just an innocent victim,'' says <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Hruska </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewelry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The lesson that has to be learned from this is that ... you have to take care of yourself, you have to take every precaution.'' Aside from <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON>'s death, there have been three other murders this year in the block of midtown bounded by 46th and 47th streets and Fifth and Sixth avenues, which is the Diamond District's heart. That's high for a business area, says a detective. A walk down 47th Street, where gold-filled windows front onto rooms crowded with jewelry-laden counters, suggests the business's inherent risk: Gems are easily portable, readily negotiable, highly valuable things Danger, says one dealer, is `` an occupational hazard.'' But some say something is wrong when a young, relatively inexperienced, unprotected woman is allowed to carry half a million dollars worth of jewels to an unknown prospective buyer. As is customary in the industry, <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> only had to sign memos to receive the diamonds on consignment from a broker with whom she'd done business before `` This was an enormous deal and way beyond <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>'s league,'' says <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON>'s friend from childhood. `` If things are n't changed it can happen again and it will happen again.''

 Born in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and raised on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> earned a two-year associate's degree in business and went to work in advertising for more than seven years. Slim, athletic, with long dark brown hair, she is remembered by friends and associates as sincere, kind, family-oriented. In 1986, she decided to go into the jewelry business. `` She was always interested in things like archaeology and gems and stones and physics,'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> started out selling what are called `` findings'' _ jewelry parts and raw metal. When her interest turned to diamonds she entered the <ORGANIZATION> Gemological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in June 1987, to learn what are known in the trade as the four C's _ color, clarity, carat weight and cut. She emerged an accredited expert in the quality of diamonds and other precious stones. She had met a broker, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischler </PERSON>, who says he became her `` mentor in the diamond business.'' He describes her as a woman of `` simple elegance,'' one who wore little makeup or jewelry. Her eye, he says, was on the top. If so, she was in the right place: Last year, 80 percent of the $ 3.4 billion in non-industrial diamonds that entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> came into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Much of the actual diamond dealing is conducted in secure offices or in bourses like the <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on West 47th Street. There, amid high-tech security and state-of-the-art business conveniences backed by three computer systems, men in long beards lean across narrow tables littered with pieces of white waxed paper. Tweezers in hand and loupe to eye, they trade tiny crystals potentially worth millions of dollars. It is a business based in trust. Deals are sealed and stones change hands on just a handshake and the words `` mazel and brucha'' _ Yiddish for `` luck and blessing.'' A date of payment is agreed upon, a memo is signed. Should one side renege, the dispute goes to the club's arbitration. Though she started out in sales, and earned money doing free-lance deals during and after her student days, <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> apparently decided she did not belong in this part of the industry. When she disappeared, she had worked several times on a free-lance basis verifying gems at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s, the auctioneers. She was also interviewing for a full-time job in diamond merchandising at <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The women who do make their living dealing in the <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> know well the rules of this exotic world, where some very Orthodox men will put a stone on the counter for them to pick up, rather than risk touching a woman to whom they are n't married. They are also well acquainted with its dangers. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Laufer </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, 35, runs the retail and wholesale jewelry exchange started by her father. Two years ago, her husband, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, 35, left the store to meet someone who owed him money. He was carrying about $ 6,000 worth of jewelry, his wife said. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>'s body was found in February 1987, in a <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> swamp. He had been shot four times, in the head and chest.

 For most of <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON>'s short time in the business, she was not confronted by the dangers. While in school, she began to do free-lance sales, first of finished jewelry, later of actual gems. As time went on, <PERSON> Fischler </PERSON> said, she began to ask for larger and more important stones for clients. She continued to free-lance after graduating in December, and on Feb. 1, <PERSON> Fischler </PERSON> says, <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> called and said she had a prospective buyer for investment-quality diamonds. At about 5:30 p.m. on Feb. 3, <PERSON> Fischler </PERSON> says, he put <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> in a taxi. She was to deliver an engagement ring to a customer at 6 p.m. and then meet a diplomat from a Third World nation who was supposedly interested in the diamonds. The meeting had been arranged through two Italian brothers who were friends of <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Fischler </PERSON> says she did n't seem overly excited. He had given her stones worth as much as $ 250,000 before. When he'd heard nothing by midnight, <PERSON> Fischler </PERSON> said, he called <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON>'s apartment and she told him the meeting had been canceled at the last minute. <PERSON> Fischler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> agreed to meet at noon the next day, when she would return the diamonds and hand over $ 3,500 from the sale of the engagement ring. She called an associate of the broker's around 11:30 a.m. and said she was on her way. She was last reported seen shortly after noon in the vestibule of her <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> building. No one has been charged in <LOCATION> Mangiameli </LOCATION>'s death or the theft of the diamonds. But authorities say the brothers, <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivalta </PERSON>, were arrested on April 11 and charged with interstate transportation of stolen property _ one of the stones _ and are suspects in <LOCATION> Mangiameli </LOCATION>'s disappearance. When <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON>'s body was found June 9, the medical examiner's office said she had not been dead for very long, `` certainly ... not months. But that estimate later was rescinded because of the water temperature and other variables, according to office spokeswoman <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Borakove </PERSON>. Now, <PERSON> Borakove </PERSON> says, `` We're still not prepared to give any information out on the timing of the death.'' The Rivaltas have been held without bail since their arrest and face trial Sept. 26 in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court. The federal complaint against the pair alleges that two weeks after <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> disappeared, <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivalta </PERSON> sold a pear-shaped diamond at a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> pawnshop for $ 14,000. An appraiser identified it as one of the six missing gems. Both brothers gave separate videotaped statements to the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> district attorney's office in March saying they did not buy diamonds shown to them on Feb. 2 by <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON>. <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> says that <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> _ who lived in the same apartment building as <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> _ described himself as an interior designer. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> <PERSON> Childers </PERSON> says that at the time of his arrest, <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON>, 33, was on probation on a burglary charge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and had been arrested several times in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, mostly for `` theft-related'' crimes. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fischler </PERSON> say they never met <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivalta </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> described to <PERSON> Fischler </PERSON> as a vice president of the brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc In an affidavit dated April 28, <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON>, 48, described himself as `` on leave of absence'' from the firm. But the company's personnel director, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacoff </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> started as a security guard in April 1984 and worked his way up to the post of clerk in the international operations department. He said he was fired Feb. 26 for failing to return from vacation. Some people in the <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> say <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> was wrong to carry diamonds to meet someone she did n't know. Yet many dealers and brokers carry jewels around, and danger is widely regarded as inevitable in a business that deals daily in some of the world's most precious objects The district contains a heavy presence of uniformed and undercover police and private security guards, but it is n't always enough. Recent deaths include that of a man who was thrown to the ground and struck his head on the sidewalk during a mugging in June. At one end of the spectrum are Colombian criminals who squirt their prey with ketchup and commit robbery while the hapless victim is trying to clean it up. `` Sometimes they end up with $ 100,000 score and sometimes they end up with someone's lunch,'' says Detective <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Midtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Precinct </LOCATION>. Then there are the Soviet emigres who work a more sophisticated con, finding it easier to set up a deal and get a foot inside the door of a jewelry business than `` the average black kid from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>,'' he says. In such an environment, it can take just one mistake to become a casualty. <PERSON> Fischler </PERSON> says <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> was `` smart, maybe a little naive and that's why she got conned. But nobody's perfect.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, danger `` is an occupational hazard in the sense that there'll always be someone who'll try and put a scam on you,'' says <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. She too carries jewels _ and takes a different route home every night. But, she says, `` you ca n't go to work every day thinking that someone is out to kill you, because then you may as well just stay in bed.''

 Scaling sheer cliffs, sometimes blindfolded, is not every executive's idea of a good time. But adventure training, which matured into a big business in the economic expansion of the 1980s, is here to stay. Outward Bound challenges managers to test themselves by taming the wilderness on five continents, and dozens of competing programs are offering variations on the adventure theme.

 In the cold pre-dawn light of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>, a dozen executives of the <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> shiver into jogging gear. They wheeze through a 20-minute run on a winding pine-forest trail, reluctantly plunge half-naked into a rushing mountain stream, and then head off to climb some rocks. It's all in a day's work at the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where hard-charging managers learn teamwork in the wild. Over the next five days, the spark-plug executives would discover gears they never knew they had. Among their daily feats, they clawed up a 70-foot cliff blindfolded and scaled a 13,000-foot peak, posing for photographs at the summit like an <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION> assault team. `` In a couple of days I'll be back in the office saying, ` Wow, did I do all that stuff?''' says <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brasiola </PERSON>, manager of Champion's international manufacturing operations. The executives were sent to Outward Bound as an experiment by Champion, one of a growing number of companies introducing adventure into management training to build camaraderie and cultivate leadership. Having come of age in the long economic expansion of the 1980s, executive training camps have themselves become a growth industry with scores of programs attracting thousands of corporate customers. No longer dismissed as a passing fad, the programs have become standard operating procedure for many companies. Part of the idea is to confound, surprise, shock and scare managers into breaching preconceived limits and thinking about new ways of doing things. The programs often are a mixture of seminars, scout camp, serious self-reflection and good-natured jokes about sore muscles. `` We'll give you just enough advance warning about what you'll do, so you wo n't spend a lot of time worrying about it,'' the Champion group was told by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bound </ORGANIZATION>'s Professional Development Program The training partly reflects a shift in what companies are seeking in a leader. They still want scrappy soldiers who are n't afraid to brawl with rivals to achieve success But they also want people with compassion, humility, vision and willingness to manage by consensus, not edict. Though its heyday arrived only recently, adventure education has been around since Outward Bound first trained <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> sailors to withstand the ordeal of German U-boat attacks in World War II. Today, the school offers courses in wilderness settings on five continents, from Himalayan mountaineering to sailing off the coast of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Outward Bound remains by far the largest adventure trainer among at least 70 competing programs. Enrollment has nearly doubled to more than 4,000 men and women annually over the past few years, according to <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, spokeswoman for Outward Bound <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> national headquarters in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. Clients range from giants like <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to entrepreneurs in the pizza business, which pay anywhere from $ 150 to more than $ 300 a day to throw people into physical challenges they've never faced before `` Most people at these events will say, ` I ca n't do that.' And most people do n't want to try because it scares the hell out of them,'' says <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamahiro </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> vice president who helped design the Colorado Outward Bound corporate program. `` It's the worst thing that can happen in life and business,'' he says. `` If you're fearful of taking risks, your whole life is limited. That, in a simplistic way, is what Outward Bound does. The wilderness is a classroom for coming face to face with conquering things you ca n't do.'' But some critics contend adventure training can be counterproductive and hurt morale, especially among workers who may be physically disabled. Others say most adventure trainers have no hard-core business acumen and do n't understand the reality of the work place. A few wonder how climbing rocks or dangling from ropes will translate into higher productivity and profits. `` My sense is that it's a beginning, a first step,'' says <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennis </PERSON>, professor of management at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. `` How do you re-create that same environment within the company? That's the real issue. Unless the environment is supportive and compatible with the kind of lessons you learn in outdoor education, it can have a backlash or even lower morale.'' Ironically, part of the backlash may be a function of the programs' popularity. They have become so ingrained in some corporate cultures, the thrill of participation seems to have worn thin. In the Champion group, for example, some participants balked at quitting cigarettes, complained about the alcohol ban and vowed to gorge themselves on steak and liquor when it was over. Others grumbled about the hard bunks in the school's <LOCATION> Leadville </LOCATION> base camp, the early-morning jogs and bone-chilling dip in the stream, which instructors cheerfully describe as an Outward Bound tradition. Still, at the end of the Champion course, many members of the group said they had enjoyed it despite blistered feet and altitude headaches from the thin mountain air. A few had second thoughts. `` It depends on the people,'' says <PERSON> Kjell </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlsen </PERSON>, 30-year-old chief of Champion's European financial operations. `` You could have a 300-pound manager who works great in the office. But if you stuck him out here, you'd kill him.'' Although accidents are rare, outdoor corporate training programs strictly enforce safety, partly because of tragedies that have befallen executives who venture into the wilderness on their own. In late July, the chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> was struck and killed by lightning while peak-climbing with his wife in <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. About a year ago, five advertising executives died in a white-water rafting accident in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> Anyone over age 45 on an Outward Bound course needs a doctor's permission to participate Climbers must wear helmets. The school's rule No 1 for peak expeditions: Quit in a thunderstorm and head below timberline.

 Many companies have found staff resistance to such programs fades when participants discover the joys of conquering physical challenges. Those feelings are carried back to the job and often have a profoundly positive impact. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruggerre </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Mentor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graphics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a computer concern in <LOCATION> Beaverton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, decided last year to enroll himself and 17 subordinates in an Outward Bound rafting expedition down the Rogue River in southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. He said his goal was to strengthen manager relationships within the rapidly expanding company. `` I legislated that we were going to do it,'' says <PERSON> Bruggerre </PERSON>, 42. `` No one else wanted to. We had people who had never slept outside before. Their idea of roughing it was checking into the Maui Hyatt Regency without a reservation.'' After a few days, the reticence disappeared. <PERSON> Bruggerre </PERSON> says the catalyst was an exercise in which everybody slid down a sheer cliff on a rope. `` When people got through that, it really lifted their confidence and experience,'' he says. There are some failures. When a large soda bottler retained Outward Bound to help it absorb managers of a newly acquired subsidiary, many participants simply followed orders from the highest-ranking member of their group, a senior vice president who was to be their new boss. `` The dynamics do n't work sometimes,'' says an Outward Bound instructor who had helped teach that course, speaking privately. `` This guy was just so autocratic, everybody else was afraid of him.'' Despite Outward Bound's pre-eminence, criticism of its rigid, spartan philosophy has helped engender the competition. Some rivals claim to offer more flexibility, soft beds instead of sleeping bags, filet mignon instead of freeze-dried soup. One example is Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adventure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, founded about six years ago by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, a 38-year-old former head of an insurance concern who had attended a 15-day Outward Bound course. Sites for Executive Adventure courses range from the <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Amelia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> resorts. About 175 companies have contracted with Executive Adventure for outdoor-based executive training, including <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Days </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and Domino's Pizza `` The physical nature of our program is such that 99 percent of the people can do what we do,'' says <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>, Executive Adventure's sales and marketing director. `` We've had groups filled with macho guys who want everything we can throw at them, including rope courses and rock climbing,'' <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> says. `` On the other hand, we have some groups who say, ` We're only going to be with you for a day, we do n't want to sweat.' That's fine, too.'' Executive Ventures Group, a Denver-based consulting concern formed by five former Outward Bound instructors, offers companies the option of sending people to its rustic <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> ranch or bringing courses to them by setting up outdoor activities on the lawn. Founded a few years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ventures </ORGANIZATION> has attracted clients that include <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cyanamid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Outward Bound officials admit their strict policies have driven potential clients elsewhere. They have turned away company executives who reject its alcohol prohibition or want to play golf in the afternoon. `` There are people who consistently come and say, ` Is n't there any way we could do Outward Bound and still stay in a resort?,''' <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> says. `` What makes us special is that it is n't an ordinary event. The one cardinal sin for Outward Bound would be if it were ordinary.'' On the other extreme, some adventure trainers pride themselves on offering even tougher programs. The most stressful appears to be Hell Camp, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affiliate of a famous Japanese management institute, <PERSON> Kanrisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Yosei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gakko </PERSON>. Based at the <ORGANIZATION> Calamigos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> conference center near <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the 13-day, $ 2,480 Hell Camp course has been described as a mix of Marine drill training and samurai warrior school for managers. Instructors require students to complete a 25-mile night hike with a misleading map, shout slogans by rote and croon a memorized song about salesmanship in a public place to crush their inhibitions. `` This is where it ties into the samurai, by promoting the most alert, highly skilled and efficient,'' says <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abass </PERSON>, a Hell Camp graduate and sales representative. `` If a person acquired these characteristics, they'd be pretty formidable. They could not be conquered.'' But despite newspaper advertisements and considerable publicity, <ORGANIZATION> Hell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> has not attracted significant corporate interest. Most students are small-business managers or independent salespeople, Ms. <PERSON> Abass </PERSON> says, acknowledging that `` our marketing is not right.'' Many corporate users of adventure-training consultants have been so pleased they've created in-house programs. Federal Express, for example, has established its own school in <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, similar to Outward Bound. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, an Outward Bound client for the past three years, has adopted some of the school's methods in its executive education center in <LOCATION> Ossining </LOCATION>, N.Y. The company still frequently sends managers to Outward Bound's three-day sailing courses on Hurricane Island, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Nevertheless, there are no significant studies yet on the long-term effects of adventure training. Some management specialists say it's too early to draw conclusions. `` There are zippo evaluations today because they're so new,'' says <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Rousseau </PERSON>, a professor of organizational behavior at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s J.L. <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. Even without proven results, supporters of these programs say they are here to stay. Moreover, they say the relatively modest cost makes them less vulnerable to corporate cutbacks in times of recession. `` In my judgment, the smarter, more visionary companies would abandon Outward Bound or a similar program only as a last-ditch measure,'' says <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and an Outward Bound alumnus. `` Better-managed companies now recognize this as an essential tool.''

 <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s first female mayor, describes herself as an `` old Jewish grandmother'' and is known to push her homemade chicken soup and cookies on visitors to her house. Despite <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s hardball ethnic politics, she refuses to be one of the boys. `` The average ethnic man does n't believe that women have anything on the ball,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON>, 70, a Democratic loyalist for 50 years and a councilwoman for 12. `` Now they're all watching me. They're watching this old Jewish grandmother and everything I do. I'm going to be suspect.'' As president of the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, next in line to succeed the mayor, she was sworn in May 6, hours after <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON>, one of the city's most popular mayors, died of a rare disease at the age of 56. She promptly announced she would report to the mayor's office by 8 a.m. every day, except Tuesdays, when `` I get my hair done.'' She was n't kidding. For 20 years, the same hairdresser has styled Mrs. <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON>'s hair every Tuesday at 6:30 a.m. at a downtown department store. One of her first acts as mayor was to demand that several neighborhoods be spruced up, saying the housewife in her saw the need for spring cleaning. `` My friends all say, ` That's enough of this old Jewish grandmother bit.' But it's a fact,'' she says. `` I am a grandmother and I am a housewife, too. I ca n't say I'm a 35-year-old hotshot. This is what I am and I just feel that I should acknowledge it right at the start.'' She also acknowledges holding some old-world superstitions. Last January, for example, with city hall abuzz about <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON>'s ill-health and the forthcoming council president selection, Mrs. <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON> said that amid the political intrigue she was concerned about `` <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> nan horre,'' or `` the evil eye'' as loosely translated from Yiddish. `` I fear for a black cat and I do n't walk under a ladder,'' she says. `` The old folks believed in the evil eye, and while I do n't altogether believe it, I do n't altogether not believe it. Mrs. <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON> said some aides feel she would command more respect if more people would just call her mayor. `` I'm <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> to everybody,'' she says. `` Nobody says ` mayor' and nobody says ` Mrs.''' Government by Jewish grandmother may be an asset, says <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Duquesne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor of urban history and a specialist on <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> politics. `` She's projecting this image that she has of this sort of kindly old lady, but I think that underneath there is a kind of toughness that occasionally surfaces,'' he says. But Councilwoman <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Madoff </PERSON>, one of Mrs. <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON>'s most vocal critics and a political opponent, says the mayor's image hurts women and the city. On a recent talk show, Mrs. <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON> said that if she ever met British industrialist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON>, who was launching a hostile bid for Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, she would `` scratch his eyes out.'' `` What does it do for the image of women when she says, ` I'm going to scratch his eyes out?' Mrs. <PERSON> Madoff </PERSON> asks. `` She went on and ranted and raved. She set the women's movement back 50 years.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON> later said she was joking when she made the remark, but Mrs. <PERSON> Madoff </PERSON> says the incident was just one of many gaffes made by the mayor. The mayor chose the theme `` Sophie's Choice'' for an anti-litter campaign, saying the slogan was just a catch phrase when critics familiar with the novel and the movie of the same name said the theme was in poor taste. The book told the story of a Polish woman forced by <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> to choose which of her two children would be killed. Mrs. <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON> says bringing cable television to the city was her greatest achievement as a councilwoman. Mrs. <PERSON> Madoff </PERSON> says the mayor accomplished little else and rose through the ranks mostly because she followed party dictates without question. The mayor's supporters say Mrs. <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON>'s loyalty to her constituents is her strength. `` She goes out of her way to help a lot of people,'' says <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s Register of <LOCATION> Wills </LOCATION>. `` No matter what anyone calls about in her office, she works on every little thing that people ask her to do.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Madoff </PERSON> announced Sept. 6 that she would run for mayor. Mrs. <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON> will be mayor until <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON>'s term expires in January 1990 and she expects to enter the race, although she has not yet made a formal announcement. Mrs. <PERSON> Madoff </PERSON>, 60, says the similarity between their last names has benefited both at election time. `` She gets elected and I get elected on each other's votes,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Madoff </PERSON> says. `` Every time I'm not running, people say, ` Honey, I voted for you.''' As mayor, Mrs. <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON> has adopted <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON>'s top priorities of cutting the city's 4 percent wage tax and advancing <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s transformation from a steelmaking center to a corporate and service-oriented city She says it has been difficult to follow <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON>, a friend and a political mentor. `` He was such a popular mayor,'' she says. `` People expect me to be just like him and that's almost impossible. I'm hoping that when I walk out of here I'll leave behind the same kind of city that <PERSON> Caliguiri </PERSON> left.'' The mayor and her husband, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, have been married more than 40 years and have a daughter, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, who has two children. The youngest of four children of <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> immigrants, the former <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> grew up in a tenement in the city's <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> during the Depression. When she was 16 she graduated from high school and got a job, taking free college courses at night `` wherever and whenever'' she could. About that time, she joined the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, along with Mrs. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON> later worked in the <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> office, and then in the county court as a tipstaff, an investigator and an assistant chief clerk. She also served as president of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Democratic Federation of Women. She won a seat on the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 in a special election and was re-elected in 1977, 1981 and 1985, leading the ballot the last two times.

 The children all suffer from one handicap or another, but their compassion is unimpaired. Their friend is dying. That was all they needed to know to want to make his remaining days more livable, and it is a question who inspires whom the most.

 Deep in thought, the dying man gazes across the green fields behind his trailer house. The only sounds are those of summer birds and several puppies yapping in a nearby pen, ignoring the pair of black bears pacing in their steel enclosure. Immobile in his wheelchair, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Aria </PERSON> takes a deep breath, causing the weakened muscles of his neck to bulge slightly. It takes all his strength just to talk, so he chooses his words carefully. Aria, a 38-year-old former animal trainer, is dying of ALS _ amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly called <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>'s Disease. `` Even if I feel completely down in the morning, when I see the kids I'm animated. A load has been lifted off me,'' he says in strained, slurred speech, a smile covering his face. The children Aria speaks of are 300 handicapped students at <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vocation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, 16 miles south of this rural community in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The 7th - through 12th-graders, explained <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Maready </PERSON>, have learning disabilities, emotional problems, hearing impairment or are mentally handicapped What began as a student Christmas project in 1985 to help the needy, <PERSON> Maready </PERSON> says, became a bond between these afflicted children and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Aria </PERSON>. When they learned that Aria was paralyzed from the neck down and dying and that he and his wife, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON>, and their 8-year-old daughter, Amber, existed on $ 575 a month Social Security benefits, they made a decision. `` After that Christmas, it was the kids' decision to keep it going,'' <PERSON> Maready </PERSON> recalls. `` They turned it into an adoption.'' Through cake and candy sales, car washes, auctions and fund-raising, the handicapped children have provided Aria with a motorized wheelchair and an electric page-turner to help him read. When they learned of Aria's love for nature, they laid pebble trails for his wheelchair through his family's 10 acres of greenery. Then they bought lumber and built a ramp so he could manipulate his wheelchair in and out of his trailer house. Last year they built an outside bathroom and shower, making it easier for his wife to help Aria bathe. `` He's one of my friends,'' said one of the providers, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellzey </PERSON>, 18, a senior from <LOCATION> Bartow </LOCATION> who visited <LOCATION> Aria </LOCATION> on vacation. `` I feel I've done something real good for somebody when I help him.'' Another way she helps is by writing a newsletter to keep <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> students informed of Aria's activities. `` He gives us so much in return by letting these kids be part of his life,'' <PERSON> Maready </PERSON> says. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> teaches the kids that they have something to give the world.'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and <PERSON> Janice </PERSON>, both from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, were high school sweethearts. In her senior year at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> took an independent study course at <ORGANIZATION> Ringling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Barnum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s Circus's clown school in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION> Though joining the circus was never an original goal, she soon became a featured performer. After college, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, an athletic 210-pounder, joined her and took up training wild animals _ bears, elephants, leopards, lions. They were married in 1974. In 1978, Mrs. Aria's brother, <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, left his job as a schoolteacher and the three of them formed their own act, using North American black bears, and went on tour. In 1983, <PERSON> Aria </PERSON> began to experience an occasional slurring of speech. Then, the strength in his hands deteriorated. `` That December, they told us <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> had a motor neuron disease causing the muscles to atrophy,'' his wife says. `` There's no known cause or cure.'' The following year paralysis consumed Aria's body and their circus careers came to an end. With two favorite bears and a number of dogs from their act, they moved here. <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> lives in a small trailer in back, works in the area as a stage artist and helps support the Aria family. Mrs. Aria provides constant care. To visitors, they appear as young lovers. `` We were so right to run away and join the circus,'' she reflects. `` It was a romantic kind of thing to do.'' Amber, their daughter, studied art and sculpture in college and a couple of years ago persuaded her father to take up painting. She had seen him use a pencil held in his mouth to change television stations. `` If you can do that, why not try painting?'' she asked. So far, he has illustrated two calendars, which provide a little extra income. Aria is well aware that ALS is usually terminal after five years. `` Right now, I'm living on borrowed time,'' he said with equanimity, `` but I have my wife, daughter, brother-in-law _ and the kids. `` Those children reinforce me. They give me more things to be thankful for.'' Aria pauses to find new energy for a personal observation. `` Life threw me a curve ball. I think I ought to stand in the batter's box and try to hit it.''

 Wolves get a bad rap, says a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> woman who owns three of the animals, but do n't get any ideas about keeping one in your house.

 Her friends call her `` the wolf woman.'' She's an animal rights activist with a taste for adventure and a yen to be a centerfold. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Warrick </PERSON>, who now publishes her own magazine devoted to her favorite canines, cringes every time she hears nursery rhymes like `` The Three Little Pigs,'' `` Little Red Riding Hood'' and `` <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> and the Wolf.'' Such tales, she says, wrongly portray wolves as ravenous beasts that prey on little children, as in a passage from the famous <ORGANIZATION> Grimm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> fairy tale: `` When she got to the wood, she met a wolf; but Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked animal he was ... `` The wolf thought: ` This tender little creature will be a plump morsel.''' `` Kids are raised fearing wolves and they grow up not caring if they are killed,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Warrick </PERSON>, who owns three wolves and this year began publishing a magazine called `` Wolves and Related Canids.'' Not all popular wolf stories put the animal in a bad light, Ms. <PERSON> Warrick </PERSON> says, citing the Disney films `` Never Cry Wolf'' and `` The Adventures of <PERSON> Natty </PERSON> <PERSON> Gann </PERSON>.'' But the animals have traditionally had a bad reputation. They were virtually wiped out in the early part of this century in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and only now are being reintroduced into the wild. However, Ms. <PERSON> Warrick </PERSON> describes them as basically timid, opportunistic animals that go for the easiest kill. `` I'd be more afraid of a pit bull or a German shepherd,'' she says. Ms. <PERSON> Warrick </PERSON>, 33, became interested in wild animals at an early age. `` I've always been into exotics,'' she says. `` My parents always encouraged that sort of thing and we had pet rattlesnakes and raccoons _ even an 8-foot python.'' She is no stranger to adventure. Besides nursing exotic reptiles and other wildlife back to health, she started an advertising agency, was an investment counselor, performed in professional roller-skating shows and was a sky diver until a near-fatal accident. She also was chosen recently as one of 100 contestants in <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>'s 35th anniversary Playmate search. Ms. <PERSON> Warrick </PERSON> hopes to win the $ 35,000 in prize money, which she says will go toward her efforts in behalf of wolves. Seven years ago, Ms. <PERSON> Warrick </PERSON>, who lives in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and now sells 3-D computer graphic systems to the aerospace industry, was given her first wolf cub. `` That's when I realized just how intelligent they are,'' she says, noting that a wolf's brain is 30 percent larger than that of a similar-sized dog. She got around a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law that prohibits people from keeping purebred wolves as pets by registering them as dogs. But wolves, she says, are not for everyone. In fact, Ms. <PERSON> Warrick </PERSON> uses the magazine to discourage people from attempting to raise wolves at home. Too often, they get into the wrong hands and either end up put to sleep or in a wolf sanctuary. `` They do n't make good pets. They are a pack animal and will not become your house pet,'' she says. `` If they accept you, you become a part of their pack and must abide by pack rules.'' Ms. <PERSON> Warrick </PERSON>'s three Alaskan tundra wolves, Awesome, <PERSON> Nova </PERSON> and Tundra, are kept in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> because her <LOCATION> Woodland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home has too little space for them. The wolves must be kept outdoors. In the wild, they dig dens, clearing away twigs, rocks and other obstacles to protect their cubs. `` In a house, they'll automatically think it's their den and they'll pull up the carpeting and drapes to make it safe,'' Ms. <PERSON> Warrick </PERSON> says. `` You ca n't yell at them or strike them because you'll lose your bond. A dog comes back for more, but a wolf wo n't.'' The magazine, which averages 65 pages, is published every other month from Ms. <PERSON> Warrick </PERSON>'s home. It evolved from hundreds of documents sent to her from wolf biologists in such places as <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. A frequent contributor, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mech </PERSON>, is spending the summer on <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ellesmere </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> studying arctic wolves. `` It became such a waste to <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> it all for the wolf owners I know, that I decided to start the magazine,'' she says. Breeders and dog food manufacturers advertise, and so far she has broken even by doing the editing, typesetting, layout and some writing herself. `` Wolves and Related Canids'' has 500 subscribers and continues to grow. Ms. <PERSON> Warrick </PERSON> estimates there are at least 500 wolf or hybrid wolf-dog owners in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> alone. Articles on reintroducing wolves into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, veterinary advice, features on wolf owners and lesser-known canids make up the bulk of the magazine. Each issue also contains a complete listing of wolf and wildlife organizations. From 1901 to 1930, the wolf population in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was virtually wiped out. Ranchers called it predator control because wolves were attacking their livestock. But <PERSON> Warrick </PERSON> says hunters and trappers competed with the wolves for other predators, virtually eliminating the wolf's basic food source. `` Wolves only kill diseased or weak animals,'' she says. `` They're too cowardly and not strong enough to kill the strong and virile. It's a major misconception.'' For wolf cubs to be raised in captivity, they must be placed with owners before they are 10 days old. Ms. <PERSON> Warrick </PERSON>, who briefly studied veterinary medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Davis </ORGANIZATION> and took an animal keeper course at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION>, bottle-fed her charges goat's milk every three hours when they were infants. They now eat about five pounds of raw meat daily. `` They are so loving,'' she says. `` When I go into their pen, I'm overcome with licks and jumps. They knock me down and walk all over me.''

 Many research groups are looking at the health effects of smoking.

 When smoker professors returned to their offices two years ago for the fall semester at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>, they discovered they had become overnight victims of a coup d'ashtray. The school's own Institute for the Study of Smoking Behavior and Policy had struck. Those who chose to puff away inside the buildings now were forced to retreat to a small room, a smokers' purgatory with glass walls and hard chairs. The small, wiry man behind it all, Professor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Schelling </PERSON>, himself a reformed smoker, was remorseful about the smoking section. But not for long. `` I thought it was cruel and unusual punishment, but a student said, ` Do n't be hasty. Because of it I gave up smoking and so did my friend.''' Everyone knows smoking tobacco is unhealthy. But the way in which a habit once considered sophisticated was transformed into a taboo is the kind of social change <PERSON> Schelling </PERSON>, as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Smoking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, wants to understand and harness. <PERSON> Schelling </PERSON>'s mission? `` I want to help smokers,'' he says. By this he means persuading the 55 million <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> smokers to stop. `` The original emphasis was on what can we find out about the problem of quitting that will help people quit when they want to,'' says the 67-year-old economist and self-taught behaviorist. `` Now we're focusing more on policy issues.'' <PERSON> Schelling </PERSON> made a prediction: `` Smoking will disappear, slowly. In 50 years people will still be smoking, but much less.'' While other research groups examine the health effects of smoking, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s is thought to be the only one considering the deeper meaning of the habit. `` There is n't anything like it anywhere else in the world,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Nightingale </PERSON>, adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, a major institute sponsor. The idea of such an institute was born about six years ago, when <PERSON> Schelling </PERSON> expressed fascination with the cessation of smoking since World War II by scores of middle-class, middle-aged men. He promoted meetings on the subject, convincing <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bok </PERSON> among others that a more ambitious effort was needed to make any difference. Since it opened four years ago, this small, obscure research center at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> already has reached into more distant halls than the smoke-free ones under its roof. Operating as a continuing forum, the institute is host to a study group of 20 to 40 interested health, government and psychological professionals who meet monthly to discuss and exchange the latest research. In addition, at any given time some 15 assorted physicians, psychiatrists, students of government policy, health workers, sociologists and the like attached to the institute conduct independent research. This could be anything from writing a social history of smoking to studies on the effectiveness of hypnosis in breaking tobacco addiction. The work of the institute is so compelling, for smokers especially, that when a psychologist was running a study of smokers at a Veterans Adminstration hospital, she asked that its name not be published in a newspaper story about the institute. Publishing the name in the past caused a rush of volunteers that inundated the hospital. The purpose of the institute, on an annual budget of $ 600,000, is to prompt outside research and then disseminate the results. In the words of Executive Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinney </PERSON>, a former three-pack-a-day smoker and one-time chief of the federal office of Smoking and Health: `` We set out to be a convenor and stimulator.'' Some results: _ Snuffing out much of the smoking culture in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military in 1986 by contributing to then-Defense Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>'s decision to order aggressive anti-smoking efforts, from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to boot camp _ Helping persuade <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 to keep the 16-cent federal excise tax on cigarettes instead of halving it as planned _ Assisting foreign countries trying to resist <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tobacco companies eager for new markets _ Finding in a study that found teen-agers, unlike adults, can start and stop smoking many times, thus prompting health educators to shift their approach from prevention to intervention _ Prompting smoking restrictions in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> government office buildings and vehicles, after a chat <PERSON> Schelling </PERSON> had with Gov <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> get-together. _ Investigating life in a nearly smoke-free world through pollsters who work in a laboratory in the city of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, which last year instituted one of the country's toughest anti-smoking laws Once upon a time smoking was considered stylish. Tobacco companies even claimed it offered health benefits. `` What we've seen in this country is just about the most remarkable voluntary change in behavior anywhere,'' <PERSON> Schelling </PERSON> says. Institute researchers have tried to fathom this change and smoking behavior especially. They are asking, for instance, why some people never smoke and why others do despite knowing the risks. And why is it that most people who try to quit can, but hard-core smokers ca n't part from cigarettes no matter how hard they try? The institute is also eager to know how to prevent teen-agers from taking up smoking since there is evidence that smoking is seldom begun past the age of 20. According to institute figures, there has been a steady decline in smoking since the 1950s. In 1949, 44 percent of adults smoked. In 1986, the latest available figures, the proportion of adult smokers was 26.5 percent, institute figures show. Among people still smoking, most try to stop. Just four years ago, only a dozen major corporations restricted smoking to avert fires and contamination of their products. Today more than half the Fortune 500 companies limit smoking on the job. Chief among the influences on this sea change is that after decades of concern about the life-shortening effects of smoking, the office of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surgeon general in 1964 made the risks official when it linked smoking to lung disease. Since then, Americans have become more self-conscious about their health, taking up exercise and improving their diets with the gusto of the Old World explorers searching for the Fountain of Youth. It is not only concern for personal health that is crushing the national smoking habit. Peer pressure has a lot to do with it. `` There is some moral opprobrium, the temperance notion that if you have to smoke, you have to suffer,'' <PERSON> Schelling </PERSON> says.

 <PERSON> Tamayo </PERSON> <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON>, a former topless dancer who became a stand-up comic with a raunchy routine, is being seen more and more on network television since she cleaned up her act. <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON>, perhaps the only female Japanese comedian delivering punch lines in English, will appear on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Comedy Store 15th Year Class Reunion'' on Oct. 13 and she was cast in `` Elysian Fields,'' a CBS drama pilot that has yet to air. The 29-year-old <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> native takes to the stage at the Dunes Hotel here clad in a purple-striped kimono, blue and gold obi sash and gold sandals. In soft, Japanese-accented English, she introduces herself and tells the audience that her name translates as `` <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>.'' Like much of her humor, the joke is partially true. Her first name does mean `` Pearl.'' She then moves to the end of World War II and startles the audience by saying, `` Thank you very much for dropping bomb.'' Otherwise, she says, there would have been no more <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> and she probably never would have been born. `` We really appreciate it,'' she says, smiling at the audience. `` But please do n't do it again.'' Later, backstage, <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON> explains that she believes that the atomic bombs detonated on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> saved many Japanese and American lives by averting a bloody land invasion. While her routine is mostly rid of the profanity that spiced her act at comedy clubs around <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and later on the <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION>, she has drawn occasional criticism that her material is racist, which she denies. `` I'm against this prejudice thing,'' she says, adding that she wants to teach Americans to laugh with Japanese people instead of at them. Onstage, she recounts the tale of her `` legendary'' grandfather, the only surviving kamikaze pilot, `` Chicken'' <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON>. When the audience seems uncomfortable laughing at the war jokes, she defuses the situation by saying, `` Some people are looking at me and thinking, ` We should have killed them all.''' <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON>, who now resides in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, says she picked up her sense of humor from her roller coaster life that initially took her from star high school pupil to college dropout to bar singer to tour guide. She then moved to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and ended up as an admittedly incompetent nanny for a wealthy family. The household eventually fired <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON>, but took such pity on her they gave her free room and board. After that, it was on to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where within three months she was in a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Fried Chicken commercial. Soon, however, she found herself wondering where her next meal would come from. So the 22-year-old woman took a job as a topless dancer in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. A visit to the Comedy Store several years later persuaded her to change stages. `` After three years of dancing naked, I wanted to move on to a better thing,'' she says. She became obsessed with becoming a comedian but she was ill-prepared to make a living by delivering laughs. `` I did n't even know stand-up comedy existed,'' she says. `` I did n't know what a punch line was.'' But she says she knew she loved to make people laugh. <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON> began at the bottom of the comedy profession, working for free at comedy clubs in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, delivering a crude act which mostly consisted of `` cussing for three minutes with my heavy, heavy accent. I was horrible.'' At least, she recalls, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> liked it and had her deliver the routine on the Playboy Channel. Over the years, <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON> honed her act into a more sophisticated routine peppered with comments on such current topics as the trade friction between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Today, the cursing barrage is gone, but ethnic groups, including Asians, Jews and blacks, are targets of <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON>'s humor. For example, she tells her audiences that Americans are getting shorter because they eat so much sushi and a diet among Japanese of burgers and fried chicken is making them taller. `` One day we can play basketball together,'' goes the punch line. In addition to learning to play basketball, Japanese are becoming more civilized, she says. `` You know hara-kiri? We finally realized it's stupid _ after 800 years.''

 Pianist-arranger <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, one of the members of the original cast back for a revival of `` Ai n't Misbehavin','' thinks the Fats <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> musical is even better than when it opened 10 years ago And that original production was good enough to lead to successful Broadway revues of music by <PERSON> Eubie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> -LRB- `` Eubie'' -RRB- and <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> -LRB- `` Sophisticated Ladies'' -RRB-. Other members of the original Broadway cast _ <PERSON> Nell </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Armelia </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charlaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON> _ are at the Ambassador Theater, again singing songs that the late composer-pianist-singer <PERSON> Fats </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> made into hits. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> sits in for <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> at the upright piano. `` There have been many extraordinarily good casts,'' <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> says. `` But none of them generate the kind of electricity that this group does. This show has taken on a deeper dimension. I do n't know if that's visible to everybody. The singers are doing the same thing they did before and as great as it was, it seems to be better now. I think I'm playing better now. `` What we were attempting, and I think we do, is to capture, be custodians of and illuminate the spirit of <PERSON> Fats </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> says. `` We're not just giving lip service to songs like ` T'ain' t Nobody's Biz-ness If I Do' and his saying, ` One never know, do one It's for fun.'' One song, `` Black and Blue,'' is n't intended to be funny, but sometimes the audience laughs as the song begins. The laughter trails off as they realize it's serious. `` All of a sudden, <ORGANIZATION> Fats </ORGANIZATION>, who's telling everybody your feet's too big and this man is fat and greasy and being the buffoon _ for which he got a lot of flack in his lifetime _ decides to create a very strong protest song,'' <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> says. `` People have been having such a good time they ca n't believe right away he's not kidding.'' `` Ai n't Misbehavin''' has been touring, drawing audiences steadily over 10 years, with different casts. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Oxley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> McDaniels </PERSON>, who've done the show often, currently play piano on Tuesday nights and Wednesday matinees, when <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> is off. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> confesses that he really does n't play like <PERSON> Fats </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON>, `` except in certain things.'' `` I use some of his stride piano idioms,'' he says. `` Stride is ` oom pah,' a rhythmic background effect, like a band. Fats was exuberant and he showed it in his percussiveness. He was able to do stride with his left hand and play other stuff up in the right hand. `` In the late 1930s and early 1940s the art of stride piano playing, and boogie-woogie, were incredible. I can tell you they are very difficult to do.'' <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> was hired as arranger when `` Ai n't Misbehavin''' started as a musical revue at the off-Broadway <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` The orchestra is built around the piano,'' he says. `` Fats never had a band. He called it Fats <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> and his rhythm. He used a drummer, bassist and sometimes a guitarist.'' Later, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> reluctantly agreed to play on-stage piano as well. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Juilliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> graduate, decided early in life to concentrate on arranging instead of composing or performing. He was intimidated by the great jazz pianists then working. `` I always tell people I was frightened by <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatum </PERSON> at an early age,'' he says. `` Then <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> came along.'' He composed the music for an off-Broadway musical comedy, `` Crystal Tree.'' `` I'm not a bad composer,'' he says, `` but that's something you ca n't do offhand You have to do it every day; it's not a part-time job. When he arranges, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> says, he starts with pinning down what is to be communicated. `` When I get a job like ` Miss <ORGANIZATION> Teen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>' for TV, I do n't need to go into that depth. I just generally do because that's how I got brought up. When I get these gigs, I work twice as hard as anybody else.'' <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> recently arranged two albums, of Dixieland and <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON> music, for the Canadian Brass. `` There is nothing in those two hours of music that is improvised and they say Dixieland should be improvised. `` I think I was successful. It's the essence of what Dixieland might have been if they'd all had the technique these boys have got. I strive for that _ the essence _ a lot.''

 Despite sagging oil revenues, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is pushing ahead with Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s dream of piping fresh water from deep under the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> to the shores of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and other thirsty coastal areas. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> maintains his Great Manmade River Project will transform a nation that is 95 percent desert into a `` Garden of Eden'' abloom in fruits, vegetables and grain. One underpinning of the project is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology, reportedly in place before January 1986, when the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration ordered <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies to stop doing business in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> on grounds that Libyans were behind terrorism aimed at Americans and other Westerners. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, riding in a beat-up Range Rover behind Bedouins on horses, came here Aug. 26, 1986, to inaugurate the factory that makes the concrete-and-steel pipes for the `` river.'' Since then, about 280 miles of the planned 12,500-mile pipeline have been laid in a trench cut through sand and underlying rock. The first stage, estimated to cost $ 4.5 billion, calls for 1,180 miles of pipeline to carry half a billion gallons of fresh water daily from wells in east central <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to a reservoir at <LOCATION> Ajdabiya </LOCATION> near the coast on the Gulf of <PERSON> Sidra </PERSON> for distribution to areas near <LOCATION> Sirte </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION>. In 1986, officials predicted the first stage would be completed in 1989. But factory manager <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaouda </PERSON> estimated recently it would be finished in 1991. The South Korean construction company <ORGANIZATION> Dong-Ah </ORGANIZATION> is cranking out the pipes and digging through the desert to lay them down. <PERSON> Jaouda </PERSON> said the Koreans' inexperience with desert terrain and weather caused the delay. `` It's not -LRB- a problem of -RRB- financing,'' said <PERSON> Jaouda </PERSON>. With current lower market prices, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s oil revenue is sharply down from the boom years of the late 1970s and early'80s. In 1980, oil revenue was $ 22 billion; by 1987, it had plunged to $ 6.6 billion. Diplomatic and business sources in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> say <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has cut back drastically on such projects as highway, school and hospital construction and is concentrating its resources on its oil industry, the military and the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manmade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` Every single Libyan is waiting for water,'' <PERSON> Jaouda </PERSON> said, leading a tour for foreign journalists flown on a government plane from <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION> to see the project. The pipeline's first part slices through bleak terrain, broken only occasionally by brush and date palms near oases, where camels and goats graze. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> comes to the desert frequently to check on progress, <PERSON> Jaouda </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> order against American operations in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> caused a few hectic months without consultants but did not delay the project, <PERSON> Jaouda </PERSON> claimed. The firm of Root and <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, turned over its duties to its subsidiary in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and Britons and Canadians have taken the place of the estimated 300 Americans who were working on the project, <PERSON> Jaouda </PERSON> said. He added that the first water to flow will irrigate 247,000 acres of farmland near the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s second largest city Other stages call for water to be tapped from wells in central west <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and be delivered to <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and for a pipeline to connect the Libyan capital, <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> Sirte </LOCATION>. Eventually a pipeline is to run out to wells in <LOCATION> Kufra </LOCATION>, deep in the south, and the final phase will pipe water as far east as <LOCATION> Tobruk </LOCATION>, near the border with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jaouda </PERSON> declined to give even the roughest estimate for completion of the entire project but that contracts will be awarded for stage two by the end of this year, a few months behind an earlier timetable. Businessmen and technicians here, including those who have worked on irrigation projects, express doubts that the project will guarantee that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> can grow all it needs to eat. They cite the competing demands by major cities, where most of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s population lives, for more and better drinking water. They predict political pressures will dictate that more and more water transported by the pipeline will be diverted from agricultural to urban use. They also say that the project is counting on enthusiastic cooperation from farmers to see that the irrigated land is most efficiently farmed. But they add that state cooperative farms generally yield much less than possible because the workers wo n't make any more profit if they work harder or better As an example, a European construction executive, who is directing a small-scale irrigation project in the desert, said the project failed because the farmers preferred to put in their extra work into private lands, not the state-run irrigated fields. <PERSON> Jaouda </PERSON> said water from the project will be used for both state and private lands. He estimated that the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manmade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>'s water, pumped up from natural wells 1,150 feet below the ground, will last 50 years. The pipe segments, each weighing 72 tons, and measuring 23 feet long and 13 feet in diameter, will probably outlast the water, he said.

 A businesswoman trying to crack the so-called glass ceiling may find a useful tool in a new book that lists the 50 companies that, in the authors' view, give women the best opportunity for advancement. Here's a report on how the list was compiled.

 It's not a book an unreconstructed male chauvinist will run out and buy, unless perhaps he's a CEO. It's written by women for women, working women, a guide to the companies where they are most likely to succeed Two avowed feminists, one a psychologist and business consultant, the other a journalist and author, spent almost three years in their quest to find the best <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies for women. They came up with a list of 50. `` It is possible that we missed a great company,'' says the journalist, <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Dusky </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sag </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, `` but I doubt it.'' The researchers sent letters to 76 executive recruiters, 72 professional women's groups and 15 researchers and asked for nominations. They came up with over 200 nominations. Some companies appeared on every list. Dusky and co-author Dr. <PERSON> Baila </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitz </PERSON>, a psychologist who practices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Teaneck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, then sent out a six-page questionnaire to the companies and requested permission for an on-site visit to interview female employees. They followed that up with private telephone interviews with the women, who were allowed to remain anonymous if what they had to say might jeopardize their jobs. The result is `` The Best Companies for Women,'' published this summer by <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster. It lists the 50 best companies, representing 22 industries, and gives profiles of each. The authors offer specific pros and cons, be it maternity leave benefits or the whereabouts of the much-discussed glass ceiling that women can only look through. `` We found that often those with terrific benefits for maternity leave had a glass ceiling so low that you could n't stand up straight without bumping into it,'' <PERSON> Dusky </PERSON> says. `` We also found that the attitude of the CEO had a great deal to do with the way the company treated women.'' In addition, the authors list 60 additional companies worth considering by women in the job market, but which they did not profile, for various reasons. `` Some companies that maybe should have been on the list refused to see us, because there was some dirt going on,'' <PERSON> Dusky </PERSON> says. One company who turned them down cold despite recommendations was found to be in the midst of a sexual harassment suit. In one of the anecdotes in the book, which reflect the slow progress of the women's movement in the workplace, <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, who got her engineering degree from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> in 1976, tells how she had no trouble setting up a job interview. But she was appalled that the interviewer did not want to know about her engineering skills. Instead they talked about the climate, the prices of apartments in the city and how long it would take to establish a credit line to buy a car. `` They must have wanted me for some quota,'' she told Dusky. Only <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> threw a transistor circuit at her and told her to analyze it. So she took that job. Nonetheless, she did get a chance to look at the recruiter's summary. It read: `` Pretty good for a girl.'' She is still there, has been promoted about every two years, and is currently a research and development laboratory manager. The authors point out that working in an engineering company is really working in a man's world and there is a lot to overcome, but with a little humor, the women say it can be done. Wall Street, the authors note, has been notoriously tough on women and the only Wall Street entry is <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>. That's because of one man, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutfreund </PERSON>, the CEO `` If he gets interested in an account, he does n't care if you're a zebra or someone from a small area of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, you're the person he'll call if anything gets screwed up or he's got an idea he wants you to think about,'' said one woman who wished to remain anonymous `` And if you need to find him, you just walk over to his desk, you do n't have to go through a secretary. He is colorblind and sex blind. He's not interested in you personally, he's only interested in what you are doing to make money from your accounts.'' Essentially, they say, the old boy networks are too entrenched and women rise for the first eight or nine years and then are told it's time to face reality. That's the end of the trail as far as upward mobility. As determined by the authors, the top 50, in alphabetical order, are: <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> @ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Barrios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bidermann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>; Children's Television Workshop; Citizens and Southern; <ORGANIZATION> Cognos </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Conran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>; The <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Drake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION>; Grey Advertising; <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>; Hallmark; <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Hewitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>; Home Box Office; <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carmel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cashways </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Pitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bowes </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Recognition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Restaurant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>; The <ORGANIZATION> Rowland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster; <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Syntex </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> West Direct.

<TEXT>
 The clatter of freight trains has replaced the crackle of gunfire and the whoosh of combat jets in this town on the Soviet border. Criss-crossing the rolling grasslands of Inner <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, the trains provide noisy testimony to improving relations between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. While officials in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> still haggle over political matters, businessmen in <LOCATION> Manzhouli </LOCATION> and dozens of other towns along the 5,000-mile border are eagerly cementing closer economic ties. `` The Russians are very easy to deal with,'' said <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chengbin </PERSON>, a businessman from a state-run firm that sold $ 31.4 million in meat to the Soviets in the first six months of this year. `` They're like the Americans, they do n't worry too much about prices.'' `` Now's the time to get in on the trade,'' said <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Wei </PERSON>, a private businessman in <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION>, provincial capital of <LOCATION> Heilongjiang </LOCATION>. `` In the next couple of years it will explode. The Soviets do n't have enough things and they like Chinese goods. In <LOCATION> Manzhouli </LOCATION>, connected to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> by rail since 1901, Soviet trucks, chemical fertilizer, wood, steel, iron ore, electrical generators and bulldozers cram freight cars, moving south into the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> heartland. Soviet railway workers and trade delegations walk freely around the town of 30,000, dotted with traditional Russian houses, their log-cabin walls painted yellow and blue. `` It's fascinating to be here,'' said <PERSON> Andrev </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedernikov </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> railway worker, as he strolled down <PERSON> Sino-Soviet </PERSON> <PERSON> Road </PERSON>, the town's main street. `` <LOCATION> Manzhouli </LOCATION> is like a small museum of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> 50 years ago.'' Across the border in <LOCATION> Zabaikalsk </LOCATION>, freight cars packed with Chinese meats, fruit, vegetables, grains, television sets, radios and thermos bottles fill the station. `` You think there are many trains here?'' said <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Evdokimov </PERSON>, another railway worker, as he looked out over <LOCATION> Manzhouli </LOCATION>'s cluttered freight yard. `` <LOCATION> Zabaikalsk </LOCATION> is even busier.'' Chinese press reports say that in the first six months of this year, trade between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> reached $ 1.3 billion, a 32 percent jump when compared to the same period last year. But Chinese businessmen said the real amount could rival <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which hit $ 10 billion last year. Indeed, on Aug. 29, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported that combined trade in the border provinces of <LOCATION> Heilongjiang </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION> had hit $ 707 million in the first half of 1988, or about 800 percent above their total for all of 1987. After two decades of tense relations, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> started trading again in the early 1980s. It began with barter. This year, it expanded to include purchases with currency from a third country, usually American dollars, and the export of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> labor to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In a further twist, Chinese officials in <LOCATION> Heilongjiang </LOCATION> said privately they expect Soviet technical advisers to return soon to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` In the 1950s, we traded because we were friends,'' said <PERSON> Xing </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenzhao </PERSON>, an official in <LOCATION> Heilongjiang </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now, we do it because we need to. That is a healthy development.'' Chinese officials say labor export could become the most important part of Sino-Soviet trade. Several said that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> could easily supply the manpower to develop <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. In its report Aug. 29, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said about 10,000 Chinese workers were expected to head to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> over the next year for construction and farming. Labor export began in July when more than 100 Chinese construction workers went to <LOCATION> Zabaikalsk </LOCATION> to build a gymnasium, several dormitories and a dining hall. Earlier in the year, 77 Chinese peasants were given 1,071 acres to grow cucumbers and watermelons in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> across the border from <LOCATION> Suifenhe </LOCATION>, another important trading post. `` We gave the Russians half and then sold them the rest,'' said a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION> who worked on the contract. `` We're looking at it as a model for future deals It makes perfect sense because we have a huge work force and they have a lot of land.'' For their part, Soviet officials in <LOCATION> Manzhouli </LOCATION> said they were interested in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for its consumer goods and food. `` Our agriculture and our light industry are weak,'' said a Soviet businessman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for us is like a big supermarket. Their stuff is generally good and inexpensive.'' In the early 1950s, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent thousands of Soviet technical advisers to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to help set up factories. But relations soured in the late 1950s as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> embraced a development model that emphasized people over machines, radically different from the Soviet plan. By 1962, all Soviet advisers had left <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Several years later, as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> moved farther left in its Cultural Revolution, firefights broke out periodically along the border. In 1969, Soviet and Chinese troops fought pitched battles on <LOCATION> Damansky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, or Zhenbao in Chinese, on the <LOCATION> Ussuri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Clashes spread to Inner <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>. `` At night, gunshots would echo all around the valley,'' said Wen He, a 59-year-old railroad worker, who sent his three sons south for a year to protect them. `` In the daytime, their jets and ours would fly above the town. We were all scared.'' Ties began improving slowly in the late 1970s, after <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> took power and instituted a series of reforms to open <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the West. They have improved further since <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> became Soviet Communist Party chief in 1985 and began to reform his country. `` Now all you hear at night in <LOCATION> Manzhouli </LOCATION> are train whistles,'' said <PERSON> Guan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancheng </PERSON>, a 54-year-old coal miner, as he strolled to his house on a bluff overlooking the hills of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. `` It is very peaceful.'' Economic relations have not proceeded without glitches. The Chinese complain that the Soviets give them only their worst timber and charge that Soviet business practices are not flexible enough. The Soviets accuse the Chinese of trying to cheat them. They also complain that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s poor railways and road network are hampering trade growth. Soviet officials have provided some help to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> transportation system, floating <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> a $ 180-million loan earlier this year to recommence work on a railway to connect <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s far west to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Both countries have moved to further relax trade restrictions. As of Aug. 13, the two countries dropped visa requirements for businessmen. More border trading posts have opened. And in July, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> announced that local governments _ not only those in border provinces _ would be allowed to cut deals with their Soviet counterparts. `` From that point on it's been very busy in <LOCATION> Manzhouli </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Xue </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiyuan </PERSON>, vice chairman of <LOCATION> Manzhouli </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everyone is coming here to talk to the Soviets. Our hotels are packed. We're a hot spot, which is kind of odd for such a little town.''

 At the Crying Deer Restaurant on <LOCATION> Sino-Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, chef <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaomin </PERSON> cracks a toothless grin and runs to the back to grab two plates of his famous salad. `` Soviet friends, you've returned,'' he shouts. `` Soviet friends, we welcome you.'' <PERSON> Andrev </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedernikov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Evdokimov </PERSON>, railway workers in this town on the Soviet border, have come back for another meal. Down the street, at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, members of the Soviet Friendship Delegation from <LOCATION> Zabaikalsk </LOCATION> dance the night away with their counterparts from the <ORGANIZATION> Manzhouli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sino-Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friendship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. At the close of the evening, under revolving green and red disco lights, <PERSON> Xue </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiyuan </PERSON>, a Chinese trade official, waxes melodramatic. `` Two great nations are becoming friends again,'' he says. `` Two peoples are moving closer together.'' On train No. 390, heading east from <LOCATION> Manzhouli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shamrett </LOCATION>, 48, and her son, <PERSON> Kostya </PERSON>, 19, are off to see relatives in <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION>, the provincial capital of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heilongjiang </LOCATION> province. `` We come from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>,'' announces Mrs. <PERSON> Shamrett </PERSON> in rusty Chinese, learned in the five years she spent in <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION> as a youngster. `` It's been more than 30 years since I saw my brother.'' `` I hope to learn about kung-fu,'' said her son. `` It's becoming very popular back home.'' Just as trade has blossomed between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, so have contacts between Chinese and Soviets. Since last year, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has allowed Soviets to return to its border provinces to visit relatives who stayed after relations between the two countries deteriorated in the late 1950s. The Soviets have done the same for Chinese with family in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Both countries also have dropped visa requirements for businessmen. <PERSON> Vedernikov </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Evdokimov </PERSON>, 29, who work on Soviet freight trains between <LOCATION> Manzhouli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zabaikalsk </LOCATION>, studied Chinese for five years at the <ORGANIZATION> Chita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pedagological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, about 180 miles from the Chinese border. Now they handle freight and mail, which have both increased markedly as trade between the countries rises. `` I had a choice between a job as a teacher or work on this train,'' said <PERSON> Evdokimov </PERSON>, speaking a mixture of Chinese and English. `` The job is boring, but I wanted to see <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It fascinates me strongly.'' <PERSON> Vedernikov </PERSON> hopes to parlay his excellent Chinese into a job as a businessmen. `` I was trained to be a translator, but when I finished school in 1980 things were still bad between our countries so there were no jobs. Now there's much possibility,'' he said. The two men said they were impressed at the economic growth in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, especially at the relative abundance of vegetables and consumer goods. They also noted the increasing number of private businesses, of which the Crying Deer is one. `` Private or cooperative businesses in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are just beginning, but here they've been going on for about five years now,'' said <PERSON> Vedernikov </PERSON>. `` I think they can teach us very much.'' Sun, a 61-year-old former member of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s famed <ORGANIZATION> Eighth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Route </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and regarded as the best chef in town, agrees. `` I say open the borders wide and we'll show them how to make money,'' he said. `` That would be a twist.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Sweet Hearts Dance''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Television sitcoms have always known about it. Presidential politicians have embraced it. Now the movies are redisovering the potent appeal of The Family. `` Sweet Hearts Dance'' is the latest variation on the family theme, and it is an unexpected winner. No movie has so touched the heart since `` Terms of Endearment.'' Of course, you might expect `` Sweet Hearts Dance'' to be impressive when you note that the writer is <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. His play and movie of `` On Golden Pond'' were exquisite depictions of the joys and sorrows of old age. Now he focuses on a younger generation of marrieds and about-to-be marrieds, contributing an equal portion of humanity and understanding. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> have been married long enough for boredom to have set in. She tolerates his macho pastimes, he largely ignores her womanly longings. He is a builder, and their life in a <LOCATION> Norman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rockwellian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> town is comfortable, familiar and dull. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s best buddy is <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>. He is a school principal, a bit dull but by no means dumb. A devout bachelor, he is attracted to the new teacher in town, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, but is wary of commitment. The story is told in seasons, each framed like an old-time calendar. The seasons change, as do the relationships of the four characters. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, rankling under his loss of freedom, finally moves out of the family house. After a <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> vacation with his lodge members, the four lives are sorted out, more or less. A synopsis makes it seem that not much happens in `` Sweet Hearts Dance.'' But it is constantly engrossing, tender without excess sentiment, and often hilarious. Amazingly, the film is the first feature directed by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON>, a television veteran who has a bright future in films. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s script and <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON>'s direction give the four stars equal opportunity to shine. With her wise, wondering eyes, <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON> is the ideal portrayer of the 1980s woman. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is a revelation, displaying none of his `` Miami Vice'' schtick. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> is ideal for the role as the intelligent innocent, and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> -LRB- `` Big'' -RRB- registers again as a bright screen presence. `` Sweet Hearts Dance'' has so many moments to cherish that it should probably be seen twice for full appreciation. The Tri-Star release was produced by <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lourie </PERSON>. The rating is R, mostly for language. Running time: 101 minutes.

 `` Cop'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>; VHS, $ 89.95; Beta, $ 29.95; Rated R -RRB- Sgt. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> is the kind of cop who wears his profession on his chest in big red letters. He's a COP. He makes his own rules and breaks others and he does n't care who he has to whack in order to rid the world of bad guys and scum. All this makes Sgt. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> -RRB- infinitely more dangerous than <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> the Ripper. He's a married man who thinks nothing of giving a hooker a whirl, and a father who tells his small daughter bedtime stories about his violent escapades. In the understatement of the video year, his wife tells him he's a very sick man, and she takes the kid and leaves him. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> does n't have time to brood about crimes of the heart; he's hot on the heels of a serial killer. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> is the one man who thinks a serial killer is involved in the obscene murder of a young woman. He's convinced she is the 15th victim of the same murderer and becomes obsessed in the hunt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Durning </PERSON> puts in a good performance as <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>' buddy and superior, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haid </PERSON> of TV's `` Hill Street Blues'' is fine as a sleazy, homosexual cop on the take. But <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>'s feminist poet, the killer's secret love object, sets the women's movement back 50 years. She's a whimpering idiot who chainsmokes her way into a dangerous situation. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, who co-produced the movie with director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, is in just about every scene. With his squirrelly look and staccato sentences, he's fairly convincing as a cop about to implode. Much of the plot is predictable, and uneven editing leaves major holes in the story. The R rating is well deserved for a screenful of blood and guts. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editor </ORGANIZATION>.

 `` batteries not included'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> Home Video; VHS-Beta, $ 89.95; Rated PG -RRB- One more whimsical fantasy from the <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> factory _ maybe one too many. <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronyn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Tandy </PERSON> head a cast of oddly assorted characters holding out against a ruthless developer who wants to buy them out of their crumbling <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> tenement so he can build a skyscraper. When they say no, the creep hires a thug to destroy the place. Enter the cutest little creatures from outer space you ever saw _ flying saucers with eyes, arms and legs who reproduce, eat pieces of coffee pots and frying pans, and _ most important _ fix things. Things like broken windows, watches, doors and, eventually, the entire building. They also fix broken hearts and minds, sparking a romance between two of the characters, helping Cronyn and <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> patch up their marriage, and rehabilitating a washed-up prize fighter who has n't done anything in years but watch TV commercials. The special effects are fun for a while, and kids will put up with the ridiculous plot, but grownups are likely to gag on the treacly sentimentality. There's also a fair amount of bashing and burning, which could prove upsetting for very young children. _ By <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Folk Songs, Children's Melodies, <ORGANIZATION> Jazz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tunes </ORGANIZATION>, And Others ...'' -LRB- Antilles-New Directions -RRB- _ <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbaniak </PERSON> <PERSON> Not </PERSON> at all the hodgepodge of styles suggested by the title, <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbaniak </PERSON>'s `` Folk Songs, Children's Melodies, <ORGANIZATION> Jazz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tunes </ORGANIZATION>, And Others ...'' is amazing, wild and beautiful music that should not be missed. <PERSON> Urbaniak </PERSON> is a Polish-born violinist who has recorded in many styles. This collection, 10 duets with pianist <PERSON> Vladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Sendecki </PERSON>, is hard to pin a label on, but it sure sounds good. The album gets off to a manic, joyful start with two songs that kick like a pair of size 20 boots. By the time `` Munchkins'' and `` Toy's Corner'' are over, listeners might find themselves gasping for air and begging for a break in the action. <PERSON> Urbaniak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sendecki </PERSON> deliver that in `` September's,'' a meditative piece that leads off a series of slower, more relaxed songs that are always compelling. But on `` Waltz,'' the second song on Side 2, it's off to the races again as the pace picks up before winding down with the jazzy finale called `` Montag.'' <PERSON> Urbaniak </PERSON>'s music usually is heavily into electronics, but this album is all acoustic. And there's never a dull moment. _ By <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Greatest Hits'' -LRB- RCA -RRB- _ The Judds On the back cover of this, their obligatory greatest-hits album, <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wynonna </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> tell us about `` the four shortest years of our lives,'' since they shopped their homemade demos around and landed themselves a record deal. No, it does n't seem like four years, but it has been. And this `` best-of'' package stands as testimony to the fact that The <ORGANIZATION> Judds </ORGANIZATION>, the much publicized red-headed mother-daughter duo, can no longer be taken as a novelty act or a curiosity. <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wynonna </PERSON> have made a harmonious place for themselves in 1980s country music. Nine of the 10 selections here have been released before on <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judds </ORGANIZATION>' three studio albums. The big hits are present and accounted for: `` Why Not Me,'' `` Mama He's Crazy,'' `` Girls Night Out.'' `` Why Not Me'' opens the collection and sets the tone; it's a proud, no-nonsense song sung by two proud, no-nonsense women. The <ORGANIZATION> Judds </ORGANIZATION> know who they are, and they know what they want _ love, happiness, respect. The lone new track is their current hit, `` Give a Little Love,'' which continues their proud tradition with a bluesy, soulful approach. Like most greatest-hits packages, The <ORGANIZATION> Judds </ORGANIZATION> give old fans all their favorites in one place, while giving the uninitiated a freshman course in Judds 101. One minor complaint: They should have included their 1987 country cover of `` Do n't Be Cruel.'' <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>, wherever he is these days, would have been proud. _ By <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Open All Night'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Elektra </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Satellites When the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Satellites get their sentence in rock history books, it will surely mention `` Keep Your Hands to Yourself,'' the hard-rocking tale of sexual frustration that brightened radio airwaves in 1986. Trouble is, that was on their debut album. `` Open All Night'' is the Satellites' second album and, predictably, lightning does n't strike twice The good news about `` Open All Night'' is that the Satellites did n't tear out their hair trying to rewrite their hit. They also do n't pretend to be anything other than what they are, a raunchy guitar army trying to fill a void left by the absence of the Rolling Stones. The bad news is the cupboard is nearly bare. For all the inspired bashing and banging, only a few songs truly stand out. There are two cover tunes on Side 1, which usually signals a lack of inspiration. Both <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' `` Whole Lotta Shakin''' and the Beatles' `` Do n't Pass Me By'' are given typical raucous workouts But it's daunting _ and maybe dangerous _ to try and top the Killer, and there are reasons why `` Do n't Pass Me By'' is one of the most obscure Beatle songs `` Sheila'' is the standout tune on the album, and that's an original. The rockers tend to blur together on the second side, until the record ends strongly with the bluesy `` Hand to Mouth,'' featuring excellent guitar by <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> and the piano of guest <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> McLagan </PERSON>. Along with assorted girlfriends and roadies, the band thanks on the album cover `` Mr. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>.'' That says about as much as you need to know about the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Satellites' music _ By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<HEAD>Star Watch: On the Road From Drugs and Alcohol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> has this fantasy about his opening remarks at the press conference to announce his candidacy for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>: `` I want to tell you right off that: 1. I am a Jew; 2. I am a recovering alcoholic; 3. I was arrested on narcotic charges, 4. I have been in therapy. Now gim me a break!'' No, <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> is not prepared to declare his candidacy yet _ maybe in the next century. `` By that time I'll be 53 years old, and I'll probably be giving up acting,'' he said. `` I've always had two major interests in my life outside of acting. One is politics, the other is teaching. So if I do n't go into politics, I'll probably become a teacher.'' There's little chance of a change of profession right away. Not with his film career once again at a peak after near-extinction. The <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> story is one of the most remarkable comebacks in recent times. His lowest point was the day after he was arrested. `` I told my wife, ` Well, it's over. I guess I'll have to find something else to do,''' he said. It happened in October 1982. Driving down <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> <PERSON> Canyon </PERSON>, he lost control of his <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> and crashed into a palm tree, flipping the car over. Police found two vials of cocaine and 31 tablets of the narcotic Percodan in the car. As with most first-time offenders, he entered a drug rehabilitation program to avoid prosecution. The drug bust almost sank a career that had already been foundering. ` I had nothing but flops for four years,'' he admitted. `` It's pretty hard to rise above something like that. His mishaps included `` The Big Fix,'' `` The Competition,'' `` Whose Life Is It Anyway?'' and `` The Buddy System.'' On the last film, his behavior seemed erratic, and word circulated that <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> was a bad risk. `` That might have been the end, except that <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON> happened to see me in a play in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, ` Total Abandon,''' said <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON>. `` He insisted on casting me in ` Down and Out in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>.''' The comedy proved a hit for <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s Touchstone Pictures, and <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> appeared in two more successes for the company, `` The Tin Men'' and `` Stakeout.'' His new film is `` Moon Over Parador,'' reuniting with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON>. In the Universal Pictures movie, <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> plays a hustling <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> actor forced to impersonate a recently deceased Latin American dictator. It is a tour de force for him, made under rugged conditions in the historic <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Ouro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Preto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION>. Co-starring with <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> was required to address 8,000 Brazilians as the Latin dictator. `` That did n't bother me,'' he said. `` I've addressed large crowds before, though on other occasions the people understood what I was saying.'' Now 40, he has been an actor most of his life. He was born in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, but his lawyer-father moved the family to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> was 7. The boy grew up among the children of the rich and famous in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. He was 9 when he announced he intended to become an actor, and he occasionally acted in plays and films during his teens. <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> makes no claims to a `` lost childhood.'' `` During all that time I was a son, a brother, a student, as well as an actor,'' he said. `` I had a fairly normal boyhood.'' He lasted only a year at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fernando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> before pursuing a career in earnest. In 1973, he attracted notice as <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Face </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> in `` <PERSON> Dillinger </PERSON>,'' then he joined the now-legendary cast of `` American Graffiti.'' Two other blockbusters of the 1970s followed: `` Jaws'' and `` Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'' The climax of the <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> career came with the Academy Award he received as best actor for `` The Goodbye Girl.'' Then he began the downhill race, accelerated by bad decisions, alcohol and drugs. <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> was interviewed at a location that symbolizes his return to grace. He occupies a suite of offices at <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, where he is developing film projects. He expects to continue the arrangement with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, which has taken over <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION>. Understandably, <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> is weary of reliving his downfall for reporters. `` Recently I ran into <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, who asked to interview me for her show,'' he said. `` I told her, ` Look, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, there is only one <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> story at the moment, and I have already told that story in Parade magazine, <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> Today, etc. Until there is another <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> story, I'd rather wait.' `` You know what she said? ` I have to agree with you.'''

<HEAD>The Artists: Faded, Scarred Rothko Murals on Display</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The late abstract expressionist <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON> said he was less interested in color and form than in expressing human emotions. Now, as <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> displays a colossal series of Rothko murals, the consequences of the artist's philosophy _ as well as years of neglect _ have become clear. The three murals, some 500 square feet of oil and acrylic on canvas, have badly faded in the sunlight during the 16 years they hung in a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> dining room, so much so that they actually have changed color. They also suffered rips, scratches and splatters caused by bumping chairs and spilled food. On one panel is scrawled the name <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> The </PERSON> institution for years was criticized for what was believed to be its mishandling of the paintings, particularly from devotees of the so-called <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> of modern artists, co-founded by <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON> before World War II. A new study conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> scholars has turned up two prime culprits: the artist and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON> contributed to the demise of the works by using a highly unstable paint _ lithol red _ to form the background of all three murals. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> made matters worse by failing to protect the canvases from sunlight and careless visitors. `` <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> has gotten so much bad press about the <PERSON> Rothkos </PERSON> that we did n't feel it would matter if we said again, ` they're in tough shape,''' said <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>, head conservator at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. The color used by <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON> has a reputation as a `` fugitive pigment'' and its fleeting existence on <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON>'s canvas explains why. The artist apparently had no idea in 1962 when he completed the paintings that the color was susceptible to fading. His attitude toward the subject was revealed in a conversation related by <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, head conservator of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in the late 1960s: `` I said, ` What kind of paint do you use?''' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> recalled in a telephone interview. `` He said, ` I use oil paint and if I run out I go downstairs to the Woolworths and buy whatever's there.' He should have known better.'' The five-and-dime paint was n't up to the conditions in the sun-filled penthouse suite in Harvard Square that housed the murals from 1963 until 1979 when, scratched, scuffed and faded, they were removed to a vault. A wine-dark crimson, chosen in honor of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, formed the background color of the murals. On two panels, the color faded to a dull, denim blue _ nearly <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> blue. And to make matters worse, the color faded unevenly, ruining the intended uniformity of background that made the room vibrate with color. `` It was like walking into a medieval cathedral at sunset,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who helped unroll and mount the paintings when they arrived at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. The paintings are on display at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Sackler </PERSON> museum through Oct. 2. They are arranged in the same configuration as their original setting in the university's <ORGANIZATION> Holyoke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> but are now far from any direct sunlight. `` If -LRB- <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON> -RRB- could see the extent to which these particular color relations had been so drastically altered he would most likely disown the paintings,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> associate art Professor <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Chave </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON> expert. `` I think they're relics, basically. They're artifacts.'' The paintings still have value, in <LOCATION> Chave </LOCATION>'s view, much the way <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON>'s `` The Last Supper'' can move a viewer despite extensive deterioration. `` They were allowed to be exposed to an incredible amount of light in their original installation and that's why they faded so drastically,'' <PERSON> Chave </PERSON> said. `` No one was doing anything about it. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> really did not pay attention to what was happening.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON>, former director of the Fogg and one of those directly involved in promoting <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON>'s donation of the murals to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, places most of the blame on the artist. `` <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON> was passionate to create a room, but he had not the slightest idea what was involved,'' <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> officials, he said, were loathe to `` question the quality of his technique. ... We were certainly unprepared for the speed with which they went.'' <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON> was contacted once about the fading of the murals, <PERSON> Chave </PERSON> said. He rejected a proposal to varnish the canvases to protect them. In 1970, at age 67, <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON> committed suicide, 57 years after he came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. After his death, confusion and controversy over control of <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON>'s estate complicated any decision about the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> paintings. Since then, another, even larger set of murals at the <LOCATION> Rothko </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> has had to undergo treatment because a chemical used in their varnish reacted with the atmosphere to create white splotches on black paint. But <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON>, former conservator of the <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON> foundation, said <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON> is only one of many modern artists whose works have fallen victim to decay. `` Because of the emphasis on this it does look like <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON>'s the only bad boy in town,'' <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Kooning </PERSON> used mayonnaise on his paintings. Longevity is low on the totem pole.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Like the title of her current hit single, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> says she still believes stardom will be hers. `` I believe in myself, but I know it takes time,'' says the 21-year-old singer, whose first hit single, `` I Still Believe'' has climbed the charts to the Top 40. She recently talked about her career in an interview at the offices of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. She compared herself to a long list of contemporary artists, including <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, before actually calling herself a `` young <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Summer </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> has been heavily influenced by rhythm and blues and Latin sounds, and she likes her music to have those elements. However, she does n't like to be compared to other young artists such as <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> or <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. She says they're too `` pure.'' She prefers being thought of as sexier. `` I'm a romantic,'' <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> said. Her self-titled LP contains the popular love ballad, `` I Still Believe,'' as well as more upbeat tracks, including the hit `` What You See Is What You Get.'' Most of these danceable tunes portray love and happiness, with one pop tune that warns against drunken driving. Born <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, she took the last name <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> because `` that's what I've always wanted to be, a star.'' She started singing in choirs in grammar and junior high school. `` They always had choirs that you could join as a hobby, so I took singing because I felt it was fun,'' she said. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> dropped out of high school to put out her first album, `` I Want Your Love,'' on Mirage Records. She later realized a lot more than singing was involved in the music business and that there was a lot more to life than singing, so she went back to school to get her diploma. Her first big break came when she appeared in the movie `` Beat Street,'' a 1984 dance film, as an auditioning singer. She also co-wrote the songs `` Shadows of the Night'' and `` Vicious Beat'' for the movie's soundtrack. Her other appearances were with an all-girl breakdancing group called The Dynamic Dolls. They once performed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for President and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Though her father, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, who sang with the pop group Spiral Staircase, was in the music business, he was n't her main influence. `` My father did n't influence me, my mother influenced me,'' <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> said. `` She always told me I would be successful and if I wanted to do something I could do it. My father? I was happy that he was my dad and he had a record out, but I wanted to show him that I could do just as he could so he would be proud of me. Now I'm doing it for me.'' <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> spends a lot of time on the road touring. After meetings with managers, voice lessons and family visits to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, she enjoys returning to the tranquility of her new home in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where she's writing songs for an upcoming album. What's does <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> see in her future? `` I want to be married by 24 and have a baby by 25,'' said the singer, who already has names picked out for the five children she wants. `` They'll be my audience in case there's not enough of one. I want to be like my mom, who had seven. It's like camp.'' Another movie apperance is n't on her agenda, though. `` I've been asked to do movies but have n't taken anyone up on their offer because I'm so into my music right now,'' she said. `` I'm trying to concentrate on my shows and do a good performance so people can enjoy me and say, ` I'm going to go out and buy that album.''' Asked about doing television, <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> perked up and said with a big smile, `` I want to do the Cosby Show. I want to meet <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: The Big Picture of the Auto Industry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As the story of maverick automaker <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> is being discovered by movie-goers in the acclaimed <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas-Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON> movie `` Tucker,'' dozens of writers continue to labor quietly on the big picture of automobile history. Books on the rich development of the industry and its cultural impact remain largely left to small publishing houses and university presses. Five recent publications are worth reading. Here are thumbnail sketches of them:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flink </PERSON>'s `` The Automobile Age'' -LRB- The <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, $ 25 -RRB- is thick with colorful detail on the industry, its leaders and the automobile as an icon. He focuses on all the highlights, such as the days when <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s Model T democratized the industry by making cars affordable for millions of Americans. He then steers us through the emergence of stylized cars at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> under the direction of <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and the legendary <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, head of the Styling Section, when <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> outsold <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> in every year from 1931 to 1970 with the exception of 1935 and 1945. There also are low points: the modern Japanese invasion; <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> turning down <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> for free after World War II, and how under German direction it became by 1972 the best-selling car in the history of the automobile industry. <PERSON> Flink </PERSON> blends observations of cultural historians to show the many changes wrought by the car culture: the disappearance of corner grocers and the emergence of the supermarket; the proliferation of fast-food joints; the increased ability of millions to vacation at far-flung spots; the emergence of entrepreneurs who had an eye on the road, such as <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who turned an idea into an empire on short order. He looks at the car as an emancipator of women, as destroyer of close relationships with neighbors, as a modifier of architecture. <PERSON> Flink </PERSON> is a professor of comparative culture at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, and affiliated with its <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. He also is the author of `` The Car Culture,'' and `` America Adopts the Automobile.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 The history of the car industry gets a coffee-table presentation in <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyne </PERSON>'s `` Power Behind the Wheel: Creativity and the Evolution of the Automobile'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Stewart </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tabori </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, $ 35 -RRB-. <PERSON> Boyne </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Space Museum of the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, parlays his experience into an attractive book. The book is complemented by archival pictures and especially by the work of collaborator <PERSON> Lucinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a specialist in automobile photography. Whether <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> is focusing her camera on the door of a <ORGANIZATION> Duesenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SJ </ORGANIZATION>, the lights of a Lincoln or the fine points of a <ORGANIZATION> Pierce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arrow </ORGANIZATION>, the result enhances, and sometimes overshadows, <LOCATION> Boyne </LOCATION>'s history The author augments some of the technical history with such colorful items as a letter the outlaw <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> to tell him that the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> V8 was his preferred business car.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Those hidden personalities behind the wheel get full attention in `` Driving Passion: The Psychology of the Car'' -LRB- <PERSON> Faber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Faber </PERSON>, $ 16.95 -RRB-. British authors <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Collett </PERSON> explore the car as a part of the home we take to the road. They see the car as a weapon, one that can kill and turn even the most affable people into hostile aggressors when encountering a tailgater or undimmed headlights, `` the automotive equivalent of the hostile stare.'' They see the automobile as sanctuary; as a provider of the sensual delight of speed; as a courtship vehicle, and as a statement of status. They get right down to the color of cars, citing studies that show people who have a high desire to achieve are more likely to be found in a brown, black or gray car, and to speed. Those operating at a more casual pace are likely to be found sitting in a red or yellow vehicle. In the recondite asides can be found the identity of the millionth victim of an automobile accident and the owner of the first vanity license plate, A1, issued in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1903 and said to be worth around $ 100,000. But it's the thought that counts here. The authors look behind 1950s design, for example, to tell us how the ubiquitous fins of the era grew from a fascination with fighter planes. They eventually caught on as the main design motif of the day and were embellished with snarling grilles `` clearly intended as a subliminal form of threat display,'' and moldings attached to the bumpers that were `` patently erotic.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Young ``Upstart'' Gives Old Pro a Break</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH DUNHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 By the time <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> have finished touring together, the younger performer may be sorry he coaxed the country music legend out of retirement. At a recent date at the Concord Pavilion, <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> took the stage after <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON> played several numbers and charged an otherwise nonplussed audience, prompting this review by <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Selvin </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chronicle </LOCATION>: `` Giving Buck <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> a guest spot on his current tour gave the old pro a chance to blast out of retirement like a detonating grenade and show the young upstart to be the bogus dilettante he is.'' Ouch. Lucky for <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON> that scores of reviews since he came on the scene three years ago have been a tad more adoring. Many say he is the best of the `` neo-traditionalists,'' a growing group of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> recording artists who have returned to the roots of country, shunning the easy-listening trend of the 1970s. But the `` young upstart'' prefers a straightforward description of his art. `` It's hillbilly music. But a lot of people did n't like that term,'' said <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON>, taking a break from the tour to promote his third album, `` Buenos Noches From a Lonely Room.'' The tour includes 10 dates with <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. `` Neo-traditionalist is kind of a trite, fast-food term,'' he said. `` They said the term -LRB- hillbilly -RRB- will alienate somebody. But I realized a long time ago that I'm not going to please everybody.'' Performing with <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON> is living out a childhood fantasy. The former `` Hee Haw'' star's effect on <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON>'s music is evident on all three of the younger performer's albums, culminating in their joint effort, `` Streets of <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>.'' Besides being musical partners, the two have come to be close pals, <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON> said. `` Our friendship is what's important, and if it's fun, we'll do it for a little while,'' he said. `` Things are n't fun more than a little while.'' Like <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Haggard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON> has a reputation as a country music rebel, turning his back on the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> establishment. He cuts his albums in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. A concept born in <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Haggard </PERSON> made their first recordings, spurning the traditional country music structure has become a tradition in itself. Despite his straight-faced stage persona, the 32-year-old <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON> always surprises reporters with his sunny demeanor. He seems humble, articulate and polite, in contrast to early reports of his penchant for loose-lipped brashness. `` I've had to learn some political lessons in the past few years,'' <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON> said. `` But if I was to go into the specifics, I would n't be adhering to the lessons I've learned. `` I was and am outspoken. I was perhaps naive in expressing myself in such a candid way. People were reacting on a very personal level about it and not accepting it for what it was _ just an opinion.'' In the early'80s he became known as a man with a chip on his shoulder, complaining to and about the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> establishment. He said young listeners could n't get a feel for real country music by listening to the current radio fare. Like his earlier albums, `` Buenos Noches'' sticks to the roots. <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON> has been playing much of the album's material for years. In fact, only two of the songs are new compositions, including the title track and `` What I Do n't Know.'' `` I think this album is a little deeper emotional statement,'' <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON> said. `` The public's view of me _ I have to remember all the time _ is 20 songs old. My view of myself is ancient at this point. I've been with my music since I was a child.'' For 11 years, he worked the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> club circuit. The roots of his success, he said, lie in his affiliation with wizard guitarist <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, whom he met while both were still struggling. `` He was on the club scene playing guitar. I was camping in the laundry room of his place at one point,'' <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON> said. `` He believed in what I was doing musically. That moral support was very important.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who plays on the current tour, has produced all of <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON>'s albums and is gaining a reputation as a producer for other recording artists. The first two <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON> albums, `` Guitars, Cadillacs Etc.'' and `` Hillbilly Deluxe,'' went gold. Although he now owns a house in the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and two vintage <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> convertibles, one a gift from <LOCATION> Owens </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON> is quick to point out that it was n't too long ago that he was hauling for a storage company and driving air-freight trucks. `` My memory's not failed me. I worked and starved for 12 years of my life, when I could n't afford but one room.''

<HEAD>U.S. Troops To Get New Insect Repellent</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s going to war against the insect repellent that troops have been using for two decades. `` The old one melted plastic watch crystals and eyeglass frames and left an oily feeling on their skin,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who helped coordinate the new version. `` Generally, they just did n't like it.'' It also smelled so bad that `` there was a feeling, particularly in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, that an enemy could smell you if you were wearing it,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The new repellent, which looks like hand cream and comes in a green plastic tube, will be in the hands of servicemen by next summer. It was developed in a $ 4.3 million effort directed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Material </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Activity </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Detrick </LOCATION>, and was prompted in part by a 1983 survey. Forty-five percent of the 1,542 soldiers questioned seldom or ever used the repellent issued since the 1960s, and 62 percent said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> needed a better one. Fifty-four percent used commercial repellents because they smelled better, felt better on their skin and lasted longer. The old version was 75 percent diethyltoluamide, commonly called deet, and 25 percent alcohol, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. The new product, 35 percent deet and with no alcohol, has a milder odor. It protects for up to 12 hours, vs. four hours with the old version and does n't wash or wear off as easily The new repellent has been tested in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. It protects against disease-carrying arthropods, such as mosquitos, chiggers, fleas, biting flies, deer flies and stable flies. The insects can carry diseases such as malaria, scrub typhus, lyme disease, dengue fever, sand fly fever and Rift Valley Fever. It still will melt and cloud some `` cheap plastic items, if you let it set for a while,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. `` But it's not as bad as the old product that would make a hole in the plastic.''

<TEXT>
 From the first dry hole to `` Big <PERSON> Bertha </PERSON>,'' the world's most productive drill bit, the records, trivia and history that give the `` oil bidness'' its unique, colorful character have been chronicled by an industry trade journal. `` Drilling Magazine,'' updating a list it first ran five years ago, is giving its 20,000 readers _ primarily well-site operators _ some targets to shoot for and records to brag about. `` It's sort of the oil industry's Guinness Book,'' says Editor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Killalea </PERSON>, who compiled the facts appearing in the current issue of the bi-monthly magazine. `` I'm very much interested in the curiosity and the oddball. While penetration rates and footage distances are incredible, they do n't grip the imagination.'' So besides records like the deepest, first and most productive well, the magazine's list includes such items as how the term `` derrick'' got its name, where the first dry hole was drilled and the strangest well blowout. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil industry is generally given a birth year of 1859 with the discovery of crude in <LOCATION> Venango </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, on land owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Watson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Brewer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The well generally is known as the Drake Discovery Well, so named for <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Seneca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haven </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, the well owner. But what's less well-known is the first dry hole, in neighboring <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. It also carries the distinction of the world's second oil well, started four days after the Drake Well More dubious, it's the first well in which oil tools got stuck. Magazine editors also have decided the strangest well blowout occurred in April 1, 1984, in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pinto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, when the Mitchell Lease No. 1 well blew and was shut quickly as a safety precaution. The next day, however, an explosion two miles away was blamed on the shut well. Apparently pressure built up and traveled along a layer of rock and salt 250 feet underground until surfacing two miles away. The term `` derrick,'' by the way, is named after a famous English hangman who skillfully practiced his trade around 1600. He was so notorious that his name was applied to anything that was hoisted or lifted. And in oil, a derrick is the structure that lifts pipe in and out of the hole. New entries to the record book include: _ The deepest water-depth oil discovery in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>: a 13,600-foot hole in 3,560 feet of water 55 miles east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> delta _ The deepest water-depth drilling in the world: 7,520 feet, <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, Nov. 5, 1987 The hole reached 17,430 feet before the drillship was moved Feb. 16, 1988. _ The most productive drill bit: `` Big <PERSON> Bertha </PERSON>,'' a 17 -LCB- - inch bit manufactured by Houston-based Hycalog, drilled 18,016 feet in 16 runs in five <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> wells with no repair between The bit, used in 1987 and this year, made more holes in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> than any other single bit. And its mark of going through more than 30,000 cubic feet of rock could make it the most productive single drill bit of all time. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state deep-drilling marks on the books include a well of 20,335 feet in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, set in 1979; 22,712 in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, reached in 1987; <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s 25,703 feet in 1980; 29,670 feet in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in 1982; and 31,441 feet in 1974 in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, which used to be the world's deepest and may be again. A 40,000-foot well being drilled in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, cited five years ago as the world's deepest, since then has caved in, according to unidentified sources quoted by Drilling Magazine. `` Glasnost or no glasnost, it's not the easiest thing to find out,'' <PERSON> Killalea </PERSON> says. `` I ultimately did discover that the well caved in a year and a half ago. So they do n't have that claim -LRB- of the world's deepest -RRB- any more.'' <PERSON> Killalea </PERSON> says he called the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for confirmation and was told to send a letter. `` They were very nice and told me they would get back to me,'' he says. `` I'm waiting to hear from them.''

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus fell 3.9 percent in August over a year ago and 31 percent from the previous month, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday. The surplus in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s international trade fell to $ 4.94 billion from $ 5.15 billion in August 1987 and $ 7.16 billion in July. In July the surplus had ended a streak of 15 consecutive months of declines to grow by 3.1 percent over the previous year's level. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> declined by 12.7 percent in August over the previous year to $ 3.25 billion, the ministry said. `` Looking at the overall trend, the volume and value of imports are growing and cutting into -LRB- <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s -RRB- surplus. The government is also stimulating domestic demand'' in an attempt to curtail its overseas trade surplus, said a <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Imports surged by 27.3 percent on a dollar basis from the previous year's level to a record $ 15.86 billion for August, the ministry said. Exports rose 18.2 percent in August from the previous year's figure to $ 20.80 billion, but declined 10.2 percent from $ 23.15 billion in July In measuring exports, officials pegged the dollar at 133.13 yen, compared with 150.83 yen one year earlier and 131.31 yen in July, while imports were determined at an exchange rate of 133.12 yen to the dollar, in contrast with 150.83 yen in August 1987 and 131.40 yen last month. The ministry said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> declined in part because of major hikes in imports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food in August. Imports of fish soared by 105.3 percent, while those of meat rose by 99.6 percent, the ministry reported. Imports of nonferrous metals also increased, growing by 140.4 percent over the previous year, it said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> measures its trade on a customs-clearance basis, which includes freight and insurance costs in imports but not in exports. If those costs were included in both categories, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus would be higher.

 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it hopes President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoes the textile and apparel trade bill sanctioned by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week. European External Relations Commissioner <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said that the bill, if signed into law, would `` inevitably lead to the collapse'' of the Multifiber Agreement, which regulates world trade in textiles. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> also claimed it would `` seriously jeopardize'' the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> round of international trade negotiations in which trade representatives are attempting to improve the global trade system, including easing trade barriers between countries. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved draft legislation Friday that would put limits on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports of textiles, apparel and shoes.

 The stock market held steady in slow trading today, unable to break its recent stalemate. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials inched ahead .18 to 2,068.99 in the first half hour of trading. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 371 up, 470 down and 488 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 13.99 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Activity, which has been sluggish for some time now, was further restrained by the observance of <LOCATION> Rosh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashana </LOCATION>, the Jewish New Year. Analysts said there was little in the news to stir up much enthusiasm for stocks. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is due to report Wednesday on the merchandise trade balance for July. Many observers believe, however, that the figures are unlikely to stir the market out of its recent torpor unless they contain some big surprise. <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> tumbled 6 -RCB- to 79. The company's <PERSON> G.D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> subsidiary was ordered to pay $ 8.75 million in damages in a major case involving its Copper-7 intrauterine device.

<HEAD>Automakers Play It Safe With 1989 Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The song remains the same in advertising for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers in the 1989 model year, with the exception of a little fine tuning. Only the Oldsmobile division of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has created a new campaign for 1989. In previous years, companies experimented with new themes such as patriotism or comparisons. For 1989, they're playing it safe, using standard themes to push their automobiles. The crew of engineers in <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Built for the Human Race'' ads have been eliminated in favor of scenes of cars, for example. `` At the very least, with consistency, you're creating something people can identify you with,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Healey </PERSON>, director of media and advertising for J.D. <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Agoura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Companies also are playing it safe by hiring the real thing to sing their commercial jingles instead of `` soundalike'' musicians A Federal appeals court ruled in June that singer and actress <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> could proceed with a $ 10 million lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and its ad agency, <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubicam </ORGANIZATION>, for intentionally imitating her vocal style after she turned down an offer to do the jingle herself. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> division hired soul singer <PERSON> Aretha </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> to belt out a new rendition of its `` Heartbeat'' theme song. Oldsmobile is turning its advertising focus on younger viewers after research showed its image was that of a stodgy family car. `` Our product was getting younger, and it was time for our image to catch up,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Christell </PERSON>, Oldsmobile general marketing manager. `` We needed to drive that message home.'' Slated to appear in Oldsmobile spots are actress <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> and her daughter; actor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatner </PERSON> and his daughter, and singer <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> Avalon </PERSON> and his son. At Mercury, the tag line is changing from `` The Shape You Want To Be In'' to `` Where Comfort and Control Are One,'' with golfer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicklaus </PERSON> teeing off this month as spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is replacing its year-old tag of `` It's Got ta Be A Dodge'' with `` The New Spirit of Dodge.'' While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carmakers are wooing the younger crowd, foreign car makers have their sights set on the older generation. `` The demographics are changing from the baby boom to the senior boom,'' said <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Rubin </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postaer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> firm that represents <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We're tilting more toward that -LRB- older -RRB- group. While its ads wo n't change dramatically, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> promotions will appear in publications such as `` 50 Plus'' magazine and on television shows such as `` Murder, She Wrote.'' <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> television ads will continue to feature the voice of actor <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Travanti </PERSON>, and the sights and sounds of actor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> still will be used in <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> ads.

 Publishing giant <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, target of unwanted takeover offers for four months, said today that it will be bought by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a cash deal that values the company at $ 2.36 billion. The announcement came after reports surfaced that <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> officials had negotiated this weekend with <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>, a private partnership that has helped other large companies thwart unwelcome takeovers. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> specializes in leveraged buyouts, in which a company is acquired through mostly borrowed money repaid from the target company's profits or asset sales. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> said in a brief announcement that <PERSON> Kolhberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> had formed a subsidiary to begin a tender offer of $ 85 cash per share for up to 26.1 million shares of the company, or 94 percent of the total. The offer values the company's 27.76 million shares at about $ 2.36 billion. The announcement was the latest twist in a takeover battle waged since May for <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>, a large New York-based publishing concern and leading supplier of college textbooks. The company owns other operations that range from the <ORGANIZATION> Berlitz </ORGANIZATION> foreign language training program to <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> clerical schools. A group headed by British publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> had been attempting to buy <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> and last week offered to raise its $ 80-a-share offer to $ 84 a share. A group headed by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> has offered $ 75 a share. The company had spurned offers from both and sought to restructure itself to thwart a takeover by selling the information division. The Bass group, which owns about 9.2 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>'s shares, had successfully challenged the move in court, but the company said today that because of the planned acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> it is scrapping the restructuring plan Rumors that <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> had enlisted the help of <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> helped boost the price of the company's stock Friday by $ 3.62 -LCB- to $ 83.87 -LCB- in composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. In early trading today <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> rose to $ 84.62 -LCB-.

<TEXT>
 Winnebagos, those behemoths of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s wide-open spaces, were launched in the home of the compact car on Monday with the blessings of the Japanese government. With a logo suggesting <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s forested mountains and blue lakes, the venture announced between <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Winnebago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, had the glitz of professional marketing. <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> coined the slogan Mobilie _ mobile plus `` ie,'' the word for home in Japanese _ to try to sell the 122 million Japanese on the American concept of family-style recreational vehicles as a way to enjoy their country's scenery. The Japanese government is seeking to cut <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s $ 60 billion annual trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by encouraging more imports of American goods into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Lauding the linkup were <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON>, the powerful Japanese minister of international trade and industry. <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON>, one of the top political figures in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, came to the lavish party <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> threw at a former imperial mansion, and he drew a public pledge from company President <PERSON> Shinroku </PERSON> <PERSON> Morohashi </PERSON> to go all-out to sell Winnebagos. `` If a Japanese trading house like <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> starts a full-fledged program, it will succeed without fail,'' <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON> said, asking <PERSON> Morohashi </PERSON> to shake hands with <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> and `` pledge to make an all-out effort to succeed.'' With a smile, <PERSON> Morohashi </PERSON> obliged. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> commented: `` With <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> marketing this product, I predict that this will be an immediate success.'' The commerce secretary is here leading executives of 25 U.S. consumer-products companies on a mission to penetrate the big but difficult Japanese market. Their slogan is `` Market <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best,'' and the products include jewelry, pet foods, furniture, sailboats, power boats and sporting goods. The party for <PERSON> Winnebago </PERSON> was the centerpiece of the weeklong mission, and the guests included members of the Diet, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s parliament, as well as <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> government officials <PERSON> Morohashi </PERSON> said his company regarded the motor home as `` one of the great achievements'' of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry and predicted it will be a success as more leisure time encourages the Japanese to do more things outdoors. `` The market is very promising for the future,'' he said. Only in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> could such a symbol of American gigantism be launched in a room where the decor included bonsai _ the purposely stunted trees that are a symbol of the miniaturism of this country of small cars and narrow roads. Gasoline costs almost $ 3.50 a gallon in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and previous attempts to market Japanese-made camper vans have fizzled because of the expense of fuel and lack of campgrounds for them. But <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is richer now, and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> says legislation will encourage the spread of campgrounds. Winnebago Vice President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Boman </PERSON>, who had four of his smaller RV models on display outside the mansion, said the 30-year-old company now exports only 0.5 percent of the 12,000 to 14,000 units produced annually. <PERSON> Boman </PERSON> hoped the <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> marketing will help increase exports to about 10 percent of production, all of which takes place in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has learned much from the Japanese, especially in motor manufacturing,'' he said. `` Now we hope to share with the Japanese people what we learned in our own experience in the leisure industry.'' The governor, who grew up in <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Winnebago </PERSON> is headquartered, expressed delight at the opening to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s market `` This is a very major step forward by American industry and we are very proud that a company based in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> is leading the way here in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said. As the party ended <PERSON> Boman </PERSON> was asked how he felt to have such lavish promotion and government backing. `` It's a great relationship,'' he said, `` and this has been a fantastic trip.''

 The next time you hear your congressman defend trade protection through quotas, higher tariffs or `` buy <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' programs, you might consider asking him the cost. It is through this sort of question that patriotic fervor, which some people think does n't cost a cent, confronts the individual budgets of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> households. Good or bad, trade protection is costly, forcing up the prices of domestic and imported goods by amounts that might surprise most people. By one estimate, it costs every man, woman and child in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> an average of $ 270 a year. That estimate, by economist <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hufbauer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, is based on his calculation of a total cost per year of $ 65 billion, or nearly double the tab as recently as 1980. How could that be, ask Americans who believe that the American economy is as remarkably open to foreigners as foreign markets are closed to Americans? <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, who studied the matter for the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, concluded that it is n't so, that `` contrary to popular belief, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has become more protectionist over the last decade.'' He says that 35 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufactured goods were protected by some form of trade barrier in 1986, compared with just 8 percent in 1975. The result, he says, is that Americans are paying through the nose. In addition to raiding consuumers' pockets, he says trade barriers invite other countries to retaliate against American industries. He cites two incidents as examples: _ When the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed tariffs on Canadian cedar in 1986, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> responded with restrictions on American computers and grains _ When the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> placed restrictions on $ 50 million worth of Chinese textiles in 1983, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> canceled <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wheat contracts worth $ 699 million The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains tariffs in excess of 20 percent on light trucks, ceramic tile, cedar shingles, fruit juice, footwear and clothing, among other goods. In some instances, quotas are added to tariffs. There are service restrictions as well. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> notes that the domestic air travel market is reserved for domestic airlines, and that only U.S.-registered ships are allowed to carry passengers and cargo between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports In fact, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 ranked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as no better than average in its amount of protected trade. The cost of trade protection is often obscured by other issues, mainly the preservation of jobs. But <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> cites a study made last year that shows more jobs were lost than created by protection of the textile industry. That study shows protectionist measures did indeed save about 46,000 textile jobs _ at an alleged cost of $ 220,000 each _ but that 52,440 jobs were destroyed in retailing, transportation and other import-dependent areas. Such examples, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> indicates, are among the more publicized. But, he observes, hidden away in various regulatory areas are many lesser known limitations that inexorably add to the cost of living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In insurance, for example, a common barrier forces foreign firms to pay higher state fees for licenses. Some state regulations require these companies to invest premiums within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. What it amounts to, says <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, is that before politicians try to raise trade barriers they should consider the costs of those already on the books, including the net cost of jobs lost.

 Share prices finished slightly higher Monday in sluggish trading on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with the market lacking a motivating force to spur it into action. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 6.2 points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,744.6 at the close of trading. The index rose as much as 9.3 points in early trading, but then fell back to show a gain of just 3.8 points just before the 11:30 a.m. -LRB- local time -RRB- release of British reports on producer prices and retail sales in August. The figures were in line with market expectations and did n't alter share prices. Volume was light, with just 213.2 million shares changing hands, down from 380.6 million on Friday. Some market watchers said traders were awaiting several key economic reports from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> later this week. Others said the market remained stalled due to a lack of interest in committing funds to the market. `` It's a stalemate,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Larkum </PERSON>, stocks analyst at <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, adding that `` there's an intellectual feeling that the market is cheap but a gut feeling that prices are going down.''

 Undermined by weakening oil prices, gold fell sharply Monday in volatile European trading. Gold finished $ 7.55 an ounce lower in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> after plunging $ 11.50 an ounce in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, where trading ended early because of a holiday. The dollar was mixed at the end of extremely quiet trading as market players sat on their positions before the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for July from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Zurich traders said the plunge in gold prices, which began in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Friday, caught them completely by surprise. `` I hate to admit it, but we're tending weaker, psychologically, if not fundamentally,'' said one <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> trader. Weaker prices for oil and other commodities have calmed fears of inflation. That has dampened demand for gold, which investors historically have used as a hedge against inflation. But traders said trading activity was limited, although they reported good demand at lower prices around $ 417. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, financial activity was expected to be muted through Tuesday because of <PERSON> Rosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashana </PERSON>, the Jewish new year holiday, and traders said they anticipated the lull would keep the market a bit thinner than usual. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 419.25 a troy ounce, compared with $ 426.80 bid late Friday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold was quoted at $ 418 when the market closed early, down from $ 429.50 late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 5.60 to close at $ 419.18. Silver bullion also fell sharply on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 6.41 a troy ounce, compared with $ 6.63 Friday. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar inched up earlier in the day for no particular reason, but was knocked back by intervention by the West German central bank when it rose above 1.8500 marks. Dealers said they expect the dollar to stay in its current range until the July trade report Wednesday. `` We have a serious case of the trade figure scenario,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Deacon </PERSON>, senior dealer at EBC-Amro bank in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. In recent months, foreign exchange trading has stalled in the days before a trade balance report. Market expectations are for a monthly trade gap of between $ 11 billion and $ 12 billion, compared with $ 12.54 billion in June. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6958 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.6980 late Friday Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Friday: 1.8453 West German marks, down from 1.8490; 1.5535 Swiss francs, down from 1.5620; 6.2775 French francs, down from 6.2865; 2.0817 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0835; 1,378.50 Italian lire, down from 1,379.50; 1.2395 Canadian dollars, unchanged. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar edged up 0.47 yen to close at 133.42 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 133.50 yen.

Traders generally expected the government to again reduce its corn and soybean harvest projections because of drought damage to the crops, analysts said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday accepted a sweetened $ 561.2 million buyout offer from its once-hostile suitor <ORGANIZATION> Mark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, ending a brief battle for the auto parts maker. Under the agreement, which was approved unanimously by <PERSON> Armtek </PERSON>'s board of directors, the <ORGANIZATION> Mark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IV </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> MIV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 46 a share for all 12.2 million common shares outstanding, $ 2 a share higher than its previous offer `` It's a great price,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeScenza </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Before this takeover fight began, the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION> stock -RRB- price was in the low $ 30s. `` It's being taken over at a price 50 percent above what the market valued the stock at.'' The bidding for <PERSON> Armtek </PERSON> began earlier this summer with a $ 40-a-share offer from Mark IV. It was raised to $ 44 a share on Aug. 17. Neither Armtek Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> nor any of the company's board members would comment on the merger, according to <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. Merger talks had been anything but friendly. After Mark IV made its first offer, the board directed company officials to explore all options, including recapitalization and possible third-party buyers. Mark IV filed suit against <PERSON> Armtek </PERSON> at the end of last month charging Armtek misued a variety of anti-takeover measures. Armtek had accused <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON> of violating disclosure requirements of federal securities laws. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said all legal action will be dropped as a result of the merger agreement. Formerly the <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, New Haven-based Armtek makes plastics and specialty chemicals used in the automotive and other industries and employs 8,000 people worldwide.

<HEAD>Developing Countries Reported Turning to Private Sector</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Most of the Third World is turning from state industries to private enterprise as a source of growth, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, private sector affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. The Washington-based lending institution in its 1988 report described this as `` a historic change'' in the global investment climate, and said it offers `` good prospects for accelerated and sustainable growth'' in developing countries. `` In most developing countries ... governments have come to rely ever more on private enterprise as an ` engine of growth','' said the <ORGANIZATION> IFC </ORGANIZATION> report.

 The stock market showed little movement in a listless session Monday, unable to break its recent stalemate. Some blue chip issues attracted buyers, but the rest of the market sagged. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 3.56 points to 2,072.37. But declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 606 up, 788 down and 536 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 114.88 million shares, down from 141.54 million Friday and the lightest total since a 108.72 million-share day on Aug. 30. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 133.85 million shares. The pace of activity, which has been sluggish for some time now, was further restrained by the observance of <LOCATION> Rosh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashana </LOCATION>, the Jewish New Year. Analysts said there was little in the news to stir up much enthusiasm for stocks. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is due to report Wednesday on the merchandise trade balance for July. Many observers believe, however, that the figures are unlikely to stir the market out of its recent torpor unless they contain some big surprise.

<HEAD>Dollar Eases in New York, Gold Hardly Changed After Plunging in

<TEXT>
 The dollar weakened marginally Monday in light trading, reflecting what money brokers called their reluctance to speculate in advance of the government's market-jolting monthly trade deficit reports. Gold ended barely changed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after a wild day in which precious metals prices tracked the volatile oil market. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> quoted gold at $ 421.35 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EDT, down 10 cents from Friday. Currency traders said the dollar's behavior typified a pattern that has emerged in days just prior to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s merchandise trade deficit reports, which have the potential of setting off sharp selloffs or rallies in the financial markets The July deficit figures are due Wednesday. `` The dollar stayed in a narrow range today and essentially went nowhere,'' said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Yannalfo </PERSON>, senior foreign exchange trader at <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> commodities futures concern. `` Everybody's waiting for that trade number. The consensus among foreign-exchange houses is for a July deficit of between $ 11 billion and $ 12 billion, compared with $ 12.54 billion in June. But the unpredictability of these numbers has made many traders reluctant to take risky positions in dollars until after the report is issued. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar edged up 0.47 yen to close at 133.42 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 133.50 yen. By the time trading concluded in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar weakened to 133.35 yen, off from 133.61 yen Friday. The dollar gained against the British pound in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where sterling was quoted at $ 1.6958 vs. $ 1.6980 Friday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound strengthened a bit to $ 1.6974, more expensive than the $ 1.6970 price Friday. Other late-dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> vs. levels late Friday included: 1.8465 West German marks, down from 1.8493; 1.5540 Swiss francs, down from 1.5617; 1.2367 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2396; 6.2815 French francs, down from 6.2890; and 1,378.85 Italian lire, down from 1,382.125. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Friday: 1.8453 West German marks, down from 1.8490; 1.5535 Swiss francs, down from 1.5620; 6.2775 French francs, down from 6.2865; 2.0817 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0835; 1,378.50 Italian lire, down from 1,379.50; and 1.2395 Canadian dolars, unchanged. Traders were more active in the gold market, which has weakened recently because of speculation about a renewed oil-price war. Prices plunged in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but rebounded in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, tracking the path of energy futures. Cheaper energy prices could partly erase the effects of inflation, historically a key reason that investors buy gold. `` For the last couple of weeks, the price of gold and precious metals have been following the oil market,'' said <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagelhout </PERSON>, a marketing analyst at <ORGANIZATION> A-Mark </ORGANIZATION> precious metals, a large trading concern in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Oil went down under $ 13 a barrel and rallied back up over $ 14. Gold did the same thing. The market has not stabilized.'' On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold for current delivery closed at $ 421.20, unchanged from Friday, when prices closed sharply lower. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold plunged to $ 419.25, down from $ 426.80 late Friday; in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold fell to $ 418, down from $ 429.50 Friday; and in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> gold fell to $ 419.18 from $ 424.78 Friday. Silver followed a similar pattern, ending largely unchanged in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after plunging abroad. Silver eased .3 cent to $ 6.437 a troy ounce on the Comex. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, silver fell to $ 6.41, down from $ 6.63 Friday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which holds just less than a fourth of the fast-growing minivan market with its <ORGANIZATION> Aerostar </ORGANIZATION>, announced plans Monday to join with <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to make a minivan in northeastern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The project, which is to deliver the new vehicles to showroom floors in three years, will involve a $ 1 billion <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> investment, about 90 percent of which is to be spent at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s van plant in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, company vice chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> said at a news conference. The factory, which paints and assembles bodies for <ORGANIZATION> Econoline </ORGANIZATION> and Club Wagon vans, will double in size to 2.2 million square feet and will employ another 1,300 people, bringing total employment to nearly 2,800. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisenhelder </PERSON> said the company first would draw employees from a pool of laid-off <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> workers before hiring people new to the company. Preparation of the plant site will begin later this month or early October, <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Arakawa </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> director, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s investment in the venture would be small by comparison to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s. `` Our basic responsibility is development so our investment is going to be rather small,'' <PERSON> Arakawa </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Arakawa </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> will take over the design and engineering of the new multi-purpose vehicle and supply parts provided by its manufacturing subsidiary, the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> will assemble and provide most of the components of the new minivan About 75 percent of the components in the new vehicle will be made in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> said. The venture would be the third formed by the two companies. In 1969, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> joined with <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transmission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sold its share to <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 More recently, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> agreed to market versions of each other's utility vehicles in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> a year ago began assembly of two cars at a plant in <LOCATION> Flat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> owns 25 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>. The newest project, <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> said, `` will give us an additional vehicle in a market niche that has grown from 5 percent -LRB- of the total truck market -RRB- in 1984 to 12 percent in 1987 and is projected at 18 -LRB- percent -RRB- to 19 percent for the 1993 model year.'' <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> said only styling work has been completed so far on the new minivan, which is expected to be in production in the fall of 1991 for the 1992 model year. About 130,000 of the vehicles are expected to be produced annually, a relatively small number considering the size of the work force. The new minivan will be a more passenger-oriented vehicle than the minivan that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sells now _ the <ORGANIZATION> Aerostar </ORGANIZATION>, which has cargo and trailer-hauling capabilities. The Aerostar held 22 percent of the compact van market during the first eight months of this year. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> also produce minivans along with <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>. But the imports hold just 4 percent of the minivan market. `` I think it's a great deal for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>,'' said auto analyst <PERSON> Maryann </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Furman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Selz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mager </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deietz </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Birney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has a marvelous way of working with Japanese partners to find products that are of mutual interest and mutual benefit to both parties. `` That's something <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has never been able to do ...'' she added. `` Chrysler is still struggling to find its way with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>.''

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Expected To Drop On New Harvest Forecast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The government's new crop-production estimates, only slightly lower than predictions made a month ago, surprised many grain market analysts and should trigger a drop in corn and soybean futures prices, experts said Monday. Grain and soybean futures settled mixed Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in light trading ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report. Soybeans were lower, wheat was higher and corn futures were mixed. On other markets, energy futures finished higher in a volatile session; precious metals were lower; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated slightly. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimated 1988 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn production at 4.46 billion bushels, compared with its August estimate of 4.48 billion bushels. The agency pegged the soybean crop at 1.47 bilion bushels, virtually unchanged from last month. And the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> predicted a wheat harvest of 1.81 billion bushels, compared with August's estimate of 1.82 billion. Although the numbers reflect severe drought damage and represent sharp reductions from last year's harvest _ 37 percent less corn, 23 percent fewer soybeans and 14 percent less wheat _ they were more optimistic than the market had anticipated and so were expected to exert downward pressure on prices, especially in soybeans and corn. `` I think corn will be down 3 to 4 cents, beans 10 cents or so, maybe even more,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Other traders said soybean futures prices could drop as much as 20 cents a bushel at Tuesday's opening. <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, vice president of grain futures trading with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said spot-market sales of corn and soybeans linked to the advancing harvest already were weakening the futures markets. `` Between the numbers and the harvest, it probably means the market's not going higher in the short run,'' she said. `` We may just move sideways for a while. We wo n't go higher, we wo n't go lower, we'll trade in a range.'' For the wheat market, which has shown some vigor recently on expectations of rising export demand, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report also had some bullish news. The government reduced its projection for 1988-89 Soviet grain production by 5 million metric tons to 205 million and raised its projected Soviet grain imports estimate to 27 million metric tons from 25 million. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also reduced its projection for the Canadian wheat harvest by 2.6 million metric tons to 15.4 million. But <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said wheat prices still could decline Tuesday in sympathy with corn and soybeans. Wheat settled 1 cent to 2 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 4.02 \ a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with September at $ 2.86 a bushel; oats were 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher with September at $ 2.61 a bushel; soybeans were 11 -LCB- cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with September at $ 8.70 -LCB- a Crude oil futures touched two-year lows below $ 14 a barrel on selling tied to the glut of oil caused by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> overproduction, then rallied late in the session to finish well above Friday's closing levels. <PERSON> Shahrokh </PERSON> <PERSON> Nikkah </PERSON>, vice president in charge of energy futures at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, attributed the dramatic turnaround on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to two announcements from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, a major <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member. He said <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> asked its fellow members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> and also non-OPEC oil producers to show some restraint in their production. The Saudis also formally denied a rumor that they opposed calling a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s pricing committee to discuss the overproduction problem, he said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 26 cents to 38 cents higher with October at $ 14.49 a barrel; heating oil was .56 cent to .81 cent higher with October at 41.68 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .56 cent to 1.10 cents higher with October at 42.62 cents a gallon. Precious metals futures finished slighty lower on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange but well above the day's lows Gold settled 30 cents to $ 1.60 lower with October at $ 422.80 a troy ounce; silver was .30 cent to 1.2 cents lower with September at $ 6.437 a troy ounce. Livestock and meat futures were narrowly mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .60 cent lower to .12 cent higher with October at 69.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .10 cent higher with September at 79.65 cents a pound; hogs were .13 cent lower to .20 cent higher with October at 37.92 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent lower to .10 cent higher with February at 47.27 cents a pound. The contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock index on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> settled .60 point lower at 266.15.

<HEAD>Son of Carl's Jr. Hamburger Founder Ordered to Pay $10,500</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The son of the founder of the <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>'s Jr. hamburger chain was ordered Monday to repay $ 10,500 as part of a federal insider trading suit against him and 15 other relatives and company officers. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> was ordered to give up the amount he avoided in losses by acting on inside information to sell debt securities in <ORGANIZATION> Carl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Karcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. In ordering the penalty, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON> declined to impose treble damages, as had been requested by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which filed the insider-trading civil suit. The judge issued a permanent injunction barring <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> from future insider trades. The case continues against other defendants, including <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>'s Jr. founder <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>, his brother, and various of their spouses and children The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> case holds that <PERSON> Karchers </PERSON>, their in-laws and one non-family official of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> hamburger chain acted on confidential, advance notice of an unfavorable earnings report to sell securities and avoid potential losses in October 1984. They are accused of avoiding losses totaling $ 300,000, and treble damages could bring a total judgment against them to over $ 1 million. The attorney for <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> claimed that Monday's ruling represented a partial victory for his client, who maintained he did n't know he had broken any laws by selling <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> debentures in October 1984. In refusing to impose treble damages, the judge in essence found <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> had n't committed an egregious violation of securities law, the attorney said. `` It indicates to me that the judge concluded that he was not a willful violator of the law,'' <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said. `` We're disappointed the court found there was a violation because -LRB- <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> -RRB- did believe he had the right to sell.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> will attempt to find the buyer of the securities and give him the money assessed <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said. The defendant, who was a vice president of Anaheim-based <ORGANIZATION> Karcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> at the time of the trades, presently operates a string of 16 <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>'s Jr. franchises in the <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, areas The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> case, filed in April, revolves around trading irregularities uncovered in random computer checks by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>. It shook many in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where the elder <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>, who appears in folksy commercials for the 450-outlet hamburger chain, is regarded as an American success story and social benefactor. The 1984 losses were attributed by some to a business downturn following the Olympic Games, and have since been reversed. The company made a $ 16 million profit on sales of $ 369 million in 1987. In Monday's case, <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> did n't contest the facts of the case: That he put in an order to his broker to sell 75 debentures, a form of corporate debt, the morning of Oct. 19. That afternoon, after being told by a company official such a sale was improper because it was based on an unreleased earnings report, he ordered the sale stopped. But 50 of the debentures had been sold. Named in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> civil suit, in addition to <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> and his father, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>, are the elder <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer the <ORGANIZATION> Karcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> DeShano </PERSON>, a vice president.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced price increases Monday for some of its personal computers, external drives, monitors, printers and expansion kits. The price hikes result from rising component costs and changing global market conditions, according to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesenberg </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president of sales and marketing. `` To continue fulfilling the increasingly high demand for our products, we are required to pursue more costly channels for dynamic random access memory -LRB- DRAM -RRB- acquisition, thereby increasing the component costs of our products,'' <PERSON> Boesenberg </PERSON> said. The two biggest price jumps, at 29 percent each, are in the Macintosh II, increasing to $ 4,869 from $ 3,769, and the LaserWriter IINT Controller Card, up to $ 2,699 from $ 2,099. The Apple IIGS rises 15 percent to $ 1,149 from $ 999. The price of the Macintosh Plus remains unchanged at $ 1,799. Company spokeswoman <PERSON> Carleen </PERSON> <PERSON> LeVasseur </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s dramatic growth during the past year has forced the company to place orders for DRAMs with new vendors and to trade at premium prices on the spot market. This has proven more expensive for the company than purchasing components from <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s traditional sources, she said, noting the shortage of DRAMs is expected to continue well into the next year.

 <ORGANIZATION> Vestar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it has agreed to acquire Celestial Seasonings, a leading specialty herbal tea company, in a management buyout from <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed and completion of the buyout is expected by early November. An earlier agreement by the Illinois-based <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> to sell Celestial to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has been abandoned. `` In view of continuing uncertainties that have delayed the sale of the assets of Celestial Seasonings to <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lipton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the agreement between <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> has been terminated,'' <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> said in a statement from its headquarters in <LOCATION> Glenview </LOCATION>, Ill. The new deal was a victory for R.C. <ORGANIZATION> Bigelow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, another maker of herbal teas, which filed a federal lawsuit in June seeking to block <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON>'s acquisition of Celestial Seasonings. <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, maintained that the merger would violate antitrust laws by uniting the nation's two largest sellers of herbal tea. New owners of the company will include <ORGANIZATION> Vestar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> private investment firm, and members of <ORGANIZATION> Celestial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seasonings </ORGANIZATION>' management, including <PERSON> Barnet </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinblum </PERSON>, who will continue as president and chief executive officer and assume responsibilities of chairman of the board when the transaction is completed. Celestial virtually created the herbal tea business in the 1970s and today its sales account for more than half of the market with their Sleepytime, <PERSON> Lemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinger </PERSON>, Mandarin Orange and other herbal teas. <ORGANIZATION> Vestar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> is a private investment firm specializing in organizing and investing its capital in management leveraged buyouts and recapitalizations. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is providing financing for the transaction.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> asked a federal court Monday to hold <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in contempt for failing to hire enough blacks and women as pilots. In a motion filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the commission charged that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> has failed to abide by a 1976 consent decree in which the airline agreed to hire qualified minority and women pilots at double the rate at which they applied for the jobs in relation to white males. For example, according to <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> officials, if <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> had 100 qualified applicants for 10 jobs and 10 of the applicants were women or blacks, at least two of the 10 new people hired would have to be women or blacks under the consent decree. Based on data provided by the company, the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> received more than 32,500 applications for entry-level pilot positions between 1985 and 1987. Among the 1,400 pilots hired, 75 were blacks or other minorities and 59 were women _ a ratio smaller than the share of blacks and women in the pool of applicants, the commission said. The motion also alleges that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> established a selection criteria that was not approved by the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> and then used some of the criteria selectively to benefit white males. `` We feel that some of the interviewing and evaluation standards were subjective and were applied subjectively,'' said <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the commission. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, said the airline has met <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> minority and women hiring targets for several categories of workers. Minorities now comprise 22 percent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s total work force and 14.8 percent of its management positions, he said. However, <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> acknowledged that with the exception of June this year, the airline has not met the consent agreement's goals in putting women and blacks in pilot seats. `` We're in tremendous competition with every other major airline that has the same objective in trying to attract -LRB- minority and women -RRB- pilots,'' he said. `` There's more demand than supply. Nonetheless, we are making progress and taking some steps to make more progress in the future.'' Among those steps, <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> listed recent affiliations with <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> aimed specifically at recruiting women and blacks into <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s pilot ranks and the planned development of a company scholarship program. In addition to the contempt citation, the commission is seeking court-ordered relief that includes job offers, back pay and retroactive seniority for as many as 3,000 women and blacks who it says were denied employment due to discrimination. The case dates back to 1973, when <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> was sued by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on charges of employment discrimination in violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it lost $ 30.5 million in its first fiscal quarter due to a one-time pre-tax restructuring charge of $ 16.6 million and poor sales of mainframe computers. `` Although our semiconductor operations experienced strong demand and modest growth in the seasonally slow first quarter, pressures on the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> continue to affect the company's operating performance,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sporck </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer. The company's stock closed down 25 cents a share at $ 9.12 -LCB- on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> before the earnings report was released. For the three months ended Aug. 28, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 30.5 million, or 31 cents per share, on sales of $ 649.4 million, compared with earnings of $ 13.5 million, or 10 cents per share, on sales of $ 517.6 million for the same period a year earlier. <PERSON> Sporck </PERSON> said sales of mainframe computers were hurt by both slowing of demand and continued pricing pressure. The computers are made by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> to the specifications of National's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> unit `` The outlook for the semiconductor group is strong,'' <PERSON> Sporck </PERSON> said. `` We anticipate continued growth in components sales for the second quarter.''

<TEXT>
 Prices for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 cars and trucks will increase an average of 2.6 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>'s subcompact Excel will go up 2.8 percent over comparably equipped 1988 models, the companies said Monday. The No. 2 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker and the South Korean car producer said in separate statements that higher material and labor costs contributed to the price changes. Some of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s sticker price increases for the'89 model year are caused by additional standard equipment on some models, company spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupp </PERSON> said. For example, the Mustang LX convertible which sold for $ 13,702 during the 1988 model year will sell for $ 14,140 in the 1989 model year. <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> said some equipment listed as optional on the 1988 models will be standard on 1989 models. The company said the largest percentage jump, more than 5 percent, was in the price of its 1989 Crown Victoria standard station wagon. Its 1988 price of $ 15,311 will jump to $ 16,208 in 1989, a combination of higher pricing and optional equipment becoming standard, <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> said. Meantime, <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> said the 1989 suggested retail prices for the Excel will range from $ 5,499 for the three-door hatchback to $ 6,949 for the five-door GL hatchback, up $ 104 and $ 204 respectively.

The settlement is conditional upon final court orders approving the settlement and the <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s order confirming <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION>'s plan of reorganization, the release said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> has urged regulators not to approve a rival commodities exchange's electronic network for 24-hour global trading of financial futures and options, on the grounds the system could lead to abuse and would be hard to operate. The <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> sent a 51-page letter dated Sept. 6 to the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> urging the commission to turn down the electronic venture, planned by the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. The 12 -LCB- - year deal, which requires government approval, calls for the <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> network to begin operating next summer It would link investors in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> via an electronic system for trading futures and options contracts on currency futures, including the British pound, the West German mark, the Swiss franc, the Japanese yen and Eurodollar time deposits.

CBOT President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> raised a number of issues in the letter to the commission, ranging from the way contracts are normally traded in the pit to the possibility of fraud. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> proposal marks a complete departure from the centralized, open outcry markets which ensure the sort of honest and efficient price discovery which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has mandated,'' <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> wrote in the letter. `` In effect, <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> is an off-exchange market. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> proposal is inherently susceptible to manipulation, prearranged trading and other abuses,'' his letter said. `` Moreover, the <ORGANIZATION> CME </ORGANIZATION>'s application is incomplete because it fails to address a variety of compliance, enforcement and liability issues including the applicability of foreign laws to the operation of <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> terminals located abroad. `` Finally, a host of unresolved financial and operational concerns, particularly in the wake of the October stock market decline, render final action on this unprecedented proposal altogether inappropriate,'' <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> wrote. <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION>, the news and market information concern, will provide the technical expertise for <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>. The Mercantile Exchange, a pioneer in the creation of financial futures and options, will provide the main market for the system.

<HEAD>General Mills Reports Record First-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it nearly quadrupled its first quarter net earnings compared with the same period last year, due largely to profits on the sale of its <ORGANIZATION> Talbots </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> clothing outlets. General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> reported net income of $ 289.9 million, or $ 3.53 per share, in the three months ended Aug. 28, compared with net income of $ 77.2 million, or 87 cents per share, in the first quarter of 1987. The 1988 figures included a $ 199.1 million gain from discontinued operations. The sales of <ORGANIZATION> Talbots </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, completed during the first quarter, generated an after-tax profit of $ 220.6 million, the company said. The gain was reduced by establishment of a $ 21.5 million reserve for the disposition of the company's <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s cafeterias and other adjustments to previously discontinued operations. General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said it plans to dispose of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s 100-unit chain during fiscal 1989. First-quarter sales rose 11 percent, to $ 1.38 billion from $ 1.24 billion, the company said. It attributed the sales increase largely to a more than 5 percent volume gain in consumer foods and expansion of restaurants by 69 company-operated units since the end of the first quarter of 1987.

 Drought and hot weather nibbled at the nation's corn and soybean crops last month, but new <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates showed Monday that most of the damage had already been done in June and July. Officials held to an earlier prediction that consumer food prices will go up an average of only 3 percent to 5 percent this year, with about 1 percent of the rise caused by drought. A further increase is expected in 1989. The department estimated the corn harvest, which is under way, at a five-year low of 4.46 billion bushels, down 37 percent from 7.06 billion bushels harvested in 1987. The new crop projections, based on Sept. 1 surveys, were down by less than 1 percent from the forecast a month ago. In May and June, before the drought tightened its grip, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projected the corn harvest at 7.3 billion bushels, based on trends and an assumption of normal weather. Those projections were revised downward in July to 5.2 billion bushels, assuming farmers got normal weather the remainder of the season. In August the forecast was lowered to 4.48 billion bushels, the smallest harvest since 1983, when drought and federal acreage curbs reduced output to 4.17 billion bushels. The soybean harvest was estimated at a 12-year low of 1.47 billion bushels, down 23 percent from 1.9 billion bushels produced last year but virtually unchanged from the August forecast. Estimates last spring called for about 1.88 billion bushels, and the July projection was 1.65 billion bushels. Production of all wheat was projected at 1.81 billion bushels, down 14 percent from 2.1 billion produced in 1987 and 1 percent below the August forecast. In May and June, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> forecast this year's wheat output would be up slightly. The July projection was 1.84 billion bushels, and the August forecast was 1.82 billion bushels. Cotton production was estimated at 14.7 million bales, slightly below the 1987 harvest and 2 percent below the August forecast. The crop was projected at 13.7 million bales in July. Corn is the largest and most important crop grown by American farmers and, as a feed ingredient, is essential to the production of meat, poultry and dairy products. Soybeans, which provide high-protein meal and quality vegetable oil used in food processing, also are vital to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food production. No new estimate of winter wheat production was included. Last month's forecast, which was carried forward into the September report, was 1.55 billion bushels, down 1 percent from last year. New estimates for spring planted wheat included durum, 49.2 million bushels, down 47 percent from 1987 production and the smallest harvest since 1961. The new estimate was also down 10 percent from August. Other spring wheat was estimated at 206 million bushels, down 54 percent from last year and 3 percent below the August forecast. Cotton production was estimated at 14.7 million bales, down 2 percent from August but only slightly below the 1987 crop. The crop was projected at 13.7 million bales in July. Overall, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crop production this year is expected to drop to 88 percent of a 1977 base used as a comparison. That would be the lowest since 1983. Crop production last year averaged 106 percent of the base year. The record was 117 percent reached in 1985, 1982 and 1981. Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Ewen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the department's chief economist, said total grain production this year is expected to drop to 191 million metric tons, down 31 percent from 1987 output. Total supplies of grain for 1988-89, which include inventories at the beginning of the season, are forecast at 366 million tons, down 24 percent from last year. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told a news conference that `` crop development now has progressed to the point where production can be forecast with a reasonable degree of confidence.'' The corn yield, for example, was estimated at 78.5 bushels per harvested acre, down from 119.4 bushels last year, the largest drought-induced reduction in yield on record, he said. From 1965 to 1987, the September estimate overstated corn production on nine occasions and understated it on 14 occasions, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. In the case of soybeans, the September estimate overshot final production in 12 years and understated it in 11. On the brighter side, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said rainfall in the last month `` has improved the conditions of pastures and ranges, although more precipitation is needed to restore them to normal.''
