<HEAD>House Speaker Takes No Position On Pay Raise Question</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who normally has strong influence over the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agenda, says he will `` neither encourage nor prevent a vote'' on a 50 percent pay raise proposed for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, judges and top executive branch officials. While <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> declined to take a stand Friday on the politically risky pay plan, he said lawmakers would ban speaking fees and certain other outside income for themselves if the proposal were enacted. The large pay raise was recommended by a presidential commission and endorsed Thursday by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who will formally send the proposal to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with his budget plan on Monday. `` We must ensure that the door to service remains open to Americans who must work to support their families, educate their children and save for their retirement,'' the president wrote <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in a letter explaining his position. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also proposed an end to the often-criticized outside income system for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The raise will become law automatically unless each house of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejects it by Feb. 8 _ 30 days after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget submission. `` I think that the speaker -LRB- House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> -RRB- is committed to making sure there is no vote,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, who has proposed legislation requiring <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to vote on any pay raise, while delaying enactment until the next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said Friday, `` I will neither encourage nor prevent a vote. Regular procedure will be followed.'' Regular procedure normally means legislation would go to a committee, be the subject of hearings, and return to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor after committee approval. Such a process normally takes far longer than 30 days. Referring to outside income for lawmakers, called honoraria, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, `` If the pay raise takes effect, there will be a ban on speaking fees and certain other forms of outside income-earning limitations are being drafted in bipartisan consultations.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, has promised a vote. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, called the pay raise preposterous and said he had asked <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders to schedule an early vote on a resolution of disapproval. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> chose not to modify the presidential commission's recommendation that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and federal district judges, who now make $ 89,500 a year, be paid $ 135,000 The speaker's annual salary would go from $ 115,000 to $ 175,000, and that of majority and minority leaders from $ 99,500 to $ 155,000. Top executive-branch officials such as Cabinet members would get raises from their current $ 99,500 a year to $ 155,000. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal would raise a president's annual pay to about $ 350,000 from the current $ 200,000, where it has stood since 1969. However, such a hike would not take effect until 1993 because of a constitutional prohibition on raising a president's pay during his term. President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday he supported <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision, but may take another look at the issue when he becomes president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes office Jan. 20. Asked by reporters if the nation could afford the big pay increase at a time when it is grappling with huge budget deficits, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` Well, I do n't know whether we can afford anything than to get this deficit under control.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has a personal stake in his recommendation because his pension would rise by 56 percent if the pay raise is approved. The pension is tied to Cabinet salaries. The pension increase from $ 99,500 to $ 155,000 annually also would apply to former <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the three former presidents should refuse the increase. A White House press spokesman, <PERSON> B.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, said the taxpayer union figures were accurate, but had no comment on the call for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to refuse the increase. `` The president was not aware of that when he approved the pay raise,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know whether it would have changed his decision, the other factors being so overwhelming.''

<HEAD>Report: Budget Will Include Boost For AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal funding for AIDS programs would expand by 30 percent while <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid would be restrained under a health and human services budget the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration will submit to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, a published report said. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in its Saturday editions reported that the $ 424.4 billion budget for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> amounts to $ 22.8 billion more than the department got in 1988. More than half of the budget, $ 260 billion, would be spent on Social Security, which would receive $ 13 billion more than is now spent to cover an increase in recipients and a 3.6 percent cost-of-living boost, the Times said. The proposed expenditures are subject to revision by President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after Jan. 20 and by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he would not make cuts in Social Security, which goes to more than 40 million Americans. For AIDS, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration recommended spending $ 2.5 billion, including $ 1.6 billion for research, education and prevention and $ 925 million for treatment and other assistance for AIDS victims. The administration proposed $ 106.1 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, an increase of $ 10 billion, but still $ 3.5 billion less than would have occurred under current law. It proposed $ 36 billion for Medicaid, a boost of nearly $ 2 billion but $ 2 billion less than under current law, the Times said. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> is the health insurance program for 31 million older Americans and 3 million other disabled persons and Medicaid is a federal-state health program for the poor.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Filed against New Political Asylum Process</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Central American immigrants filed suit against the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, demanding that the agency once again let them travel to their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destinations to apply for asylum. The lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, seeks to reverse INS rules of Dec. 16 that made it impossible for most asylum-seekers to leave south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or work while waiting 30 days for approval or denial of their claims. `` It would allow the asylum applicant to have the interview and the adjudication of the asylum claim heard and decided by the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office nearest their intended residence in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, who heads the national <ORGANIZATION> Immigrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. A hearing has been set for 9 a.m. Monday on their motion for a temporary restraining order. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> declined comment on the lawsuit because they had not seen it. Most Central Americans enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally in the <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> area of the lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, the nearest land point to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Officials with the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> said nine personnel were added Friday, bringing the total of <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> asylum adjudicators to 16, and will speed up processing and eliminate a backlog. The lawsuit accuses the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> of imposing a policy change without allowing public comment; of denying aliens access to the asylum process and access to counsel; and improperly restricting the right to work. It cites the case of a 69-year-old Nicaraguan woman who said she slept outside the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> for three nights to keep her place in line, then was told she needed a fingerprint card. She said she then walked four miles to the <ORGANIZATION> Harlingen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to obtain the prints, then returned to the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office where she again slept outside to keep her place. Before Dec. 16, asylum-seekers in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> were allowed to travel to their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destinations to apply for asylum, often <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials said they adopted the new procedure in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> to reduce huge case backlogs in those cities and to curb abuses of the system that delayed processing for legitimate asylum cases. They also said the new procedure apparently has begun to deter frivolous claims, with the more than 2,000 claims a week in early December reduced to about 1,000 a week since Dec. 16. Those who previously would have traveled out of the area are staying in places such as the condemned Amber Motel in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, on the border 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, and a squalid, makeshift campsite where several hundred people have carved out spaces in the brush.

<HEAD>South African Granite Scrapped For Bus Tunnel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The city's transit and sewage authority is giving up $ 480,000 of granite it bought for a downtown bus tunnel because the stone came from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the agency announced. `` It would violate the spirit of our policy and would be an affront to the community'' to use the granite, executive <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Thursday. The granite _ enough to cover 24,000 square feet _ is sitting in supply yards in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, where it was cut. `` We're going to have to eat the cost,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalberer </PERSON>, superintendent of the $ 430 million tunnel project. <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> hopes to sell the granite for scrap to recoup some of the cost, he added. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Royer </PERSON> agreed with the decision. `` This could be a serious affront and embarrassment for lots of people,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> banned the purchase of South African goods because of that country's policy of racial segregation, or apartheid, after a county councilman and city councilman protested the use of South African steel in tunnel work in 1987.

 The first man since the Vietnam War to get through eight years of draft eligibility without being called to arms said something was missing from his 26th birthday celebration. `` I'm proud within myself about it. I wish I had an award or something though. That would have been nice. Maybe a plaque to hang on the wall,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, the first 18-year-old to sign up and be processed by the Selective Service System after draft registration was revived in 1981, turned 26 on Friday. That made him too old to be called up even if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president reactivate the draft, according to <ORGANIZATION> Selective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I did n't have to go active and I'm glad about that,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` But if it was God's will I would have gone. It's a blessing to be a soldier for this country.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he had no idea he was the first man in the country to register when he did so. He said he just followed the law and signed up. `` I was n't worried about being drafted when I was 18. I do n't think I even thought about it, but if it had happened it would have just happened When I turned 21 I got more worried about it,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. The draft was stopped in 1973 after the end of the Vietnam War, but registration was revived on Jan. 5, 1981.

<HEAD>Airlines Asked To Replace Rivets On Older 727s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government is recommending that airlines replace tens of thousands of rivets on more than 600 older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 passenger jets. In a proposed directive issued Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> also urged the carriers to adopt special inspection procedures until the rivet work is done. The repairs are not expected to disrupt air service because most of the work will be done on a timetable that could stretch over as long as four years, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The proposed directive is the result of increasing concern about cracking on older commercial jetliners. It is similar to an order issued last October for older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s. A final order will not be issued until after a brief period to allow public and industry comment. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> estimated the repairs and extra inspections of 623 older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s will cost the airlines $ 35.7 million. In a separate action Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> broadened a previous directive for special inspections of older <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> DC-9s to include any aircraft with at least 45,000 landings. Last November, the agency told airlines to conduct repetitive inspections using the electronic `` eddy current'' method of all DC-9s that have had more than 55,000 landings because of concern about possible cracks in the fuselage skin. But the agency said since then it has discovered cracks on more than 20 aircraft that had between 45,000 and 52,000 landings, prompting the special precautions for the additional aircraft. The agency said 476 DC-9s belonging to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air carriers would be affected by the new directive. Under the order, airlines must conduct repetitive eddy current inspections of the fuselage skin as well as an area just over the wings on the DC-9s. The inspections must be conducted at least every 5,800 landings. The proposed directive on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s requires that airlines over the next four years replace from 3,300 to 4,150 rivets on each plane, depending on the model of 727 involved. It said the `` countersunk'' rivets now on the planes is believed to cause cracking under some circumstances, while the substitute `` button-head'' is less likely to do so. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said cracks on both the 727 and 737 aircraft have been traced to a `` cold bonding'' process that was used in the earlier models of the plane to bind sheets of fuselage skin together. That method was discontinued in later models. The agency said it plans to order eddy current testing and increased visual testing of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 on a regular basis until the rivets can be changed. Last October, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ordered thousands of rivets replaced on older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s to help guard against cracking. There have been a number of incidents during the past year in which large cracks developed on older aircraft.

<DATELINE>MILLEDGEVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Inmates at the Youthful Correctional Offender Institution rioted for about two hours Friday, but corrections officers and police tactical units stayed on overnight, authorities said. Three inmates and one corrections officer were injured in the uprising and there was `` minimal damage'' to the lockup said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said she did not know what set off the disturbance or how many inmates were involved. Despite the name of the facility, the average age of the 970 inmates at the prison is 24, according to Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said the injured officer, who was not identified, broke his hand, apparently by slipping and falling. The injury, she said, `` was not in contact with an inmate.'' She did not have details of the inmates' injuries. Five tactical units of 18 officers each were called in to help stop the uprising, which began about 4:45 p.m., apparently in sympathy with a disturbance at a nearby state prison earlier this week. The riot, which broke out around 4:45 p.m. with inmates damaging and breaking property, Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said. The crowd control officers used tear gas to halt the uprising in the Kemper Building, one of three units comprising the lockup, Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said. `` When they did -LRB- use tear gas -RRB-, they immediately began to quiet down. It then spilled over into the <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- a second unit -RRB-,'' she said. Tear gas was not used in the second unit, because the situation there was not as severe, Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said. `` There was no damage done. It was mostly a lot of yelling, a lot of cussing,'' she said. Because the tear gas spread beyond the Kemper Building, about 100 inmates could not be returned immediately to their cells, and were held in a yard until the gas clears, Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said. Two tactical units from <LOCATION> Milledgeville </LOCATION>, in central <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> about 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>, and one from <LOCATION> Reidsville </LOCATION> remained on the scene, Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said, adding that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> would begin an internal investigation into the disturbance. If the inmates who were responsible are identified, they would be segregated from the rest of the prison population and would face administrative charges, she said. Friday's uprising marked the second disturbance at a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> prison this week. On Tuesday, inmates rioted at <ORGANIZATION> Rivers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Milledgeville </LOCATION>, an incident officials called the most serious in the state in 10 years. More than 900 inmates participated in the earlier incident, with three officers and three inmates injured and $ 300,000 in damage reported.

 The Hard Rock Cafe is going to try again to persuade a city commission to allow a `` walk of fame'' on the sidewalks surrounding the French Quarter rock' n' roll eatery, a spokeswoman said. `` They plan to resubmit their proposal, and for the moment have pledged that the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> side be dedicated to native <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> musicians such as Fats Domino,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutson </PERSON> in a news release Friday.

<TEXT>
 Leading senators are demanding Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> explain why the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration refused to release classified information deemed important to the Iran-Contra case against <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's position on the secrecy question contributed to a move by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> earlier this week to have two key charges against North dropped. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> on Friday strongly defended the administration's refusal to allow the release of more classified material in the North case, saying that dropping the conspiracy and theft counts is `` hardly'' going to provide `` a precedent in every case. The attorney general said the question is whether it is more important `` to go ahead with a particular criminal prosecution'' as opposed to `` what harm might come to the country's long-term interests'' by exposing sensitive information. An interagency intelligence group in the administration refused to permit the release of additional classified material which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said must be disclosed in order for North to get a fair trial. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> then decided to abandon the charges that the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide illegally diverted more than $ 14 million in U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. Three others are also charged with the same counts, but their trials have been severed. North still faces 12 other charges. His trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 31. The Classified Information Procedures Act `` requires a full explanation to the congressional committees ... as to why'' conspiracy and theft charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` could not be tried without disclosing classified information,'' said the chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> committees. In a letter to the attorney general, the senators asked <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to include the explanation in his next semiannual report on the operation of the law, which was passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to prevent defendants from using `` graymail'' to scuttle their prosecution. The letter came from Sens. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, respectively chairman and vice-chairman of the intelligence panel and Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> on Monday is expected to grant <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s motion to drop the two counts against North. The Classified Information Procedures Act requires the attorney general to report to the congressional intelligence and judiciary committees any time criminal charges are dismissed on grounds that continued prosecution in open court would jeopardize national security. The lawmakers acknowledged that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, not the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, had decided to seek dismissal of the two central charges. But they said the <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION> reporting provision was enacted `` to provide an opportunity for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to review, as appropriate, circumstances of this sort.'' Such reviews are needed to `` ensure that decisions not to prosecute alleged criminal conduct were, in fact, prompted by legitimate national security concerns.''

 A program that included paid work leaves and avoiding physical exertion cut the premature birth rate at a French hospital by a third, but its cost-effectiveness is debatable, researchers say. Participants could take longer leaves than the six-week paid leave available to <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> women before their due date, said researcher <PERSON> Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Papiernik </PERSON>. For example, a woman whose job involved a lot of standing might begin the leave 10 weeks before the due date, said <PERSON> Papiernik </PERSON>, chairman of the obstetrics and gynecology department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. The program also included teaching women to avoid physically taxing situations at home like moving a household, and to follow such steps as sitting rather than standing when washing clothes, <PERSON> Papiernik </PERSON> said Friday in an interview. It also stressed close relationships with caregivers, he said. The overall goal was to reduce physical exertion that triggers the uterus to contract during pregnancy. A study of more than 16,000 deliveries at the hospital found that while premature deliveries stood at 5.4 percent of live births for 1971-74, they decreased to 3.6 percent for 1979-82. The study could not demonstrate statistically that work leaves themselves made a difference, but they probably helped, <PERSON> Papiernik </PERSON> wrote in a book about the research. But an American expert said the French approach would incur `` inappropriate and unnecessary costs'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because most participants would have had full-term pregnancies anyway. Most women at risk for premature births carry their fetuses to term, and physicians can not predict with great accuracy who will deliver prematurely, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> also said many women may not want to pass up economic and psychological benefits of working. He and <PERSON> Papiernik </PERSON> spoke at a seminar sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> March </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dimes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Some 350,000 American babies every year are born more than three weeks before the end of the normal 40-week term, the foundation says. They account for 70 percent of infant deaths, and are at risk for such problems as cerebral palsy, seizure disorders, mental retardation, and impairments of vision and hearing.

<HEAD>President Lauds Japanese Emperor For Role In Ending WWII</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> _ President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> mourned the death of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, saying he played `` a truly heroic role'' in ending World War II hostilities between his country and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` On behalf of the people and government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, we extend our deepest condolences to His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor, to the Imperial family, and to the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>,'' the president said in a statement released by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> shortly after the annoucement of the emperor's death Friday. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the emperor's 62-year reign `` spanned one of the most tumultuous, and yet at the same time constructive eras in the history of mankind _ an age of unprecedented economic collapse, a most vicious war, astonishing scientific acheivement, and dramatic political and social changes throughout the world.'' `` It was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation. His majesty played a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two peoples to an end and leading the Japanese people through a period of reconstruction and reconciliation that has resulted in both the prosperity the Japanese know today and in the close relations our two nations and peoples now enjoy,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president recalled the late emperor had visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1975, and that he and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> had `` enjoyed several meetings with him, most recently in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'' in 1986.

Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that because there will be a waiting period before <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral, the decision on whom to send would be up to the incoming administration of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent letters of condolence to both <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, and the prime minister of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, a press aide in the vice president's office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met the late emperor once on a 1982 visit to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Akahito </PERSON> visited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at his home during a trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year.

<HEAD>The Biggest Decision of a 62-Year Reign _ Surrender in World War
II</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Obit-Hirohito, Bjt</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: First available for Saturday AMs</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> TOKYO </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> _ Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> will be remembered for one overwhelming decision during his 62-year reign: <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> must bow to defeat for the first time in its history and end the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> conflict in World War II. Shortly after that decision, and for most of his reign, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> became a figurehead, isolated from his subjects by tradition and steeped in his great love, the study of marine biology. He was the last survivor among the national leaders of the World War II era. But in his first 20 years, the `` Son of Heaven'' was worshiped as a divinity descended from the <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goddess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amaterasu </ORGANIZATION>. The solitude of animal and plant life under the seas which so intrigued <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was in keeping with the character of the man who became the 124th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne at the age of 25 on Christmas Day 1926, designating his reign `` Showa'' _ `` enlightened peace.'' The emperor was generally portrayed as having played no significant role in planning or carrying out <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s military adventures in the 1930s and 1940s. But it was his first effective decision as emperor, and his most courageous, that ended the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> conflict. On Aug. 10, 1945, four days after history's first atomic bomb devastated <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and one day after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bomber dropped the second atomic bomb on <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>, the generals and admirals of Imperial <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s wartime government argued for hours in the sweltering bombproof shelter beneath the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> palace. Should <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> agree to the Allies' surrender demand, or fight on until annihilation? Speaking in what some of those present described as a slow and obviously nervous monotone, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, the spiritual and titular leader, offered his opinion for the first time. He spoke of his sorrow over the soldiers and sailors killed in the long war, and of families who lost everything in air raids. `` I can not bear to see my innocent people suffer any longer,'' he said. `` Ending the war is the only way to restore world peace and to relieve the nation from the terrible distress with which it is burdened.'' Then, evoking a memory of his grandfather, the Emperor <PERSON> Meiji </PERSON>, whose reign -LRB- 1867-1912 -RRB- saw the end of 250 years of feudal Japanese isolation from the outside world, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> told the officers: `` The time has come when we must bear the unbearable.'' In the days that followed, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> continued his break with tradition. In a national radio broadcast Aug. 15 _ the first time ordinary Japanese ever actually heard his voice _ he personally announced the decision to surrender. He told the ravaged nation that `` the war situation has developed not necessarily to our advantage.'' Three weeks later, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> donned a silk cutaway coat, striped trousers and a top hat to meet the Allied commander, Gen. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON>, at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. It was the first time <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> had ever gone to see anyone, and the first of several calls on the general who had led the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> war against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and became its postwar governor. On New Year's Day 1946, at <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION>'s insistence, the emperor publicly renounced his divinity. It was a choice that enabled <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> to remain as the symbolic head of his nation and assured that he would not face charges as a war criminal, as some abroad had demanded. It also was an act that seemed to relieve no one as much as this gentle, shy and retiring man who never seemed very comfortable as a `` living god.'' The emperor's status in the eyes of many Japanese changed to that of a kind uncle. He became a widely respected authority on marine biology. He possessed rare collections of marine life, discovered several species himself and wrote or co-authored at least 12 books on hydrozoa, or sea animals, his specialty. In recent years, his life had become the subject of a popular comic book series. Still, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> and the imperial system remained important to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. A nationwide survey by the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987 indicated more than 80 percent of 2,184 people polled supported the imperial system, while only 11 percent said it should be abolished. Five percent said the emperor should have more power. From 1946 to 1954, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> toured <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to encourage the people to rebuild. The <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which ran his affairs, said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> considered the postwar period one of the most fulfilling times of his life, in which the nation made a phenomenal recovery from a war that cost 3.1 million Japanese lives. Despite the humanization of the Imperial family, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> remained under strict control of the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Protocol was maintained at nearly all times and he was prohibited from speaking on any controversial subject. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was born on April 29, 1901. In accordance with age-old imperial custom, he was taken from his parents as an infant to be reared in isolation by household functionaries and trained for one role, that of emperor. His education came as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> surged into the modern world. The feudal samurai ethic was still strong; when his grandfather died, Gen. <PERSON> Maresuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Nogi </PERSON>, the mentor for the 11-year-old prince, calmly committed ritual suicide to follow the emperor, his master, to the grave. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> studied government and law with private tutors. When he was 20, his father, <ORGANIZATION> Emperor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taisho </ORGANIZATION>, sent him abroad _ the first time any member of the immediate imperial family was allowed outside <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, receiving various decorations. He was also received by <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> <PERSON> XV </PERSON>. The young man handled money for the first time, paying his own fare on the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> subway. He developed a passion for bacon and eggs and it became a lifelong breakfast habit. A palace chamberlain said in a 1980 interview that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> shunned Japanese food `` unless it is forced on him by an unwitting host.'' <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> also acquired a preference for Western clothes. He was never seen in public wearing traditional Japanese garb, and a palace official confided that the Emperor of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> did not even own a kimono. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> became prince regent on Nov. 25, 1921, after his father became a mental and physical invalid, became emperor five years later and was formally enthroned in 1928.

<HEAD>Senator Puts Off Mideast Trip After Questions Raised About Aide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., has postponed a trip to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> after approval was withdrawn for his chief political fundraiser to accompany him as a temporary staffer on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> payroll, a spokesman said The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions that Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the new <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, withdrew approval for <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> to make the trip after receiving an inquiry about the <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> had been scheduled to leave today for a 12-day trip to nine <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> countries. Spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> had arranged the trip and it now would be postponed. <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, a retired Phoenix-area real estate investor who has been <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>'s chief fundraiser and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> adviser for years, was being placed on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> payroll for 21 days so he could arrange, and go on, the trip, <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> planned to repay his $ 115 salary to the government and pay as much of his expenses as he could, the spokesman said. The Post reported that a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said that committee tradition did not permit members of a senator's personal staff to make trips on committee business without approval from the majority leader. <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> was placed on the payroll temporarily so he could travel on military aircraft and get an official passport and visas, <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON> said. `` I'm not exactly sure why Sen. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> as the majority leader approved it in December and then as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> unapproved it today,'' <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> had planned during his trip to discuss his opposition to arms sales to the Arab countries. The State Department hoped officials in those countries might persuade the senator to be less vociferous in his opposition, <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> has traveled with <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> to the area twice before, although those trips did not involve military transportation.

 In the 44 years since he survived a massacre of Americans at a Japanese prisoner of war camp in World War II, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> McDole </PERSON> had often wondered what happened to his Filipino rescuers. A balky telephone answering machine almost cost him a chance to find out. But thanks to the persistence of a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> nurse named <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ancheta </PERSON>, <PERSON> McDole </PERSON> finally has been able to track down the guerrilla band that saved him. Forty-four years ago, Mrs. <PERSON> Ancheta </PERSON> was <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON>, a 7-year-old whose father ran a guerrilla camp in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>; <PERSON> McDole </PERSON> was a young Marine who was brought into the camp with malaria. `` He was shaking like a leaf, he had the chills,'' she said Friday. `` I remember him, although I did n't remember his name.'' Last month, she noticed an article about a reunion of American prisoners of war in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, saw <PERSON> McDole </PERSON>'s name and called his home on New Year's Eve. But the tape on his answering machine ran out and he did n't get her last name or phone number. Publicity about his request to have `` <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'' call again resulted in a story in a <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> newspaper Wednesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Ancheta </PERSON> saw it and called <PERSON> McDole </PERSON> on Thursday. `` I saw it at 11 at night and it was too late to call. I could n't sleep and I called the next morning,'' she said `` I felt like I have known him all that while. It's overwhelming. I'm so glad to know he's alive and well after all that ordeal.'' For <PERSON> McDole </PERSON>, the conversation recalled December 1944, when he and about 150 other Americans were held by the Japanese in <LOCATION> Palawan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>. He had been there 33 months when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> forces staged an invasion nearby. `` They made a feint to come toward us but turned away,'' <PERSON> McDole </PERSON> recalled. `` That's when the Japanese decided to annihilate the group of prisoners. They had us down in trenches, and they threw in gasoline and torches. The ones who climbed over the edge were machine gunned.'' <PERSON> McDole </PERSON>'s trench was the one nearest to a 60-foot cliff overlooking a bay. `` We had started digging through anyway, and we knocked the side of ours out and went over the cliff. I think 20, 25 of us made it to the beach, but some of them panicked and they were gunned down. `` I got pinned down and hid under a pile of garbage. I stayed there all night and part of the next day. I thought I was the only man of the 150 to be alive. You do a lot of praying and crying, and I knew that if I did n't make it, nobody would know what happened. They -LRB- the Japanese -RRB- would probably blame it on our own planes.'' Of the 150 prisoners, 11 escaped and six were brought to the guerrilla camp run by Maziro Major, now 88 and retired in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> after a career in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. `` It turns out he was educated in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, which is where he met his wife,'' <PERSON> McDole </PERSON> said. `` They were wonderful to us. They saved our lives.'' The rebels protected and healed the Americans for a month, when they were picked up by a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sea plane. The two groups never made contact again. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> eventually became a nurse in the office of her husband, Dr. <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> <PERSON> Ancheta </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Algoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> McDole </PERSON>, 67, is now chief of the patrol division of the <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office. <PERSON> McDole </PERSON> said he, too, was overwhelmed by the call. `` It's brought back some of the concerns of what happened to the family. I've thought about them all a lot Then all of a sudden, boom, you get a call and I find out the captain is still alive and this is his daughter. I'm going to get a letter off to the captain today. I feel real good.'' `` All these years, I had been hoping to meet one of those men,'' she said. She and <PERSON> McDole </PERSON> said they both hope to attend a reunion next December.

<TEXT>
 Throughout his lifetime, Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> reigned behind the wide moats and imposing stone walls of the vast Imperial Palace grounds in central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. During his 62-year reign, only once did an exclusive interview with him appear in print. The <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> zealously protects the imperial family from intrusions, but granted the unique interview to a persistent <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist shortly before <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s 1975 visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Krisher </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> bureau chief for <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> from 1968 to 1980, kept his campaign secret from competitors. `` Ever since I came here I waited for an occasion to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to grant me an interview,'' <PERSON> Krisher </PERSON>, now chief editor of Focus, a Japanese-language magazine, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. For six months after the announcement of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s trip, <PERSON> Krisher </PERSON> spent about half his time meeting with lower - and middle-level officials `` I knew they could n't help me, but I asked them not to oppose or discuss my campaign,'' <PERSON> Krisher </PERSON> said. Finally persuaded that an interview before the emperor's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit would be worthwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officials relented. <PERSON> Krisher </PERSON> was permitted to meet the monarch at the Imperial Palace for 32 minutes. Although he was asked to submit questions in advance, <PERSON> Krisher </PERSON> was allowed to ask other questions. The emperor described his overseas tours _ to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 1921 and with Empress <PERSON> Nagako </PERSON> again in 1971 _ as the happiest times of his life. `` My happest expectation is looking forward to our trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> told <PERSON> Krisher </PERSON>. `` As to my view of Americans, they seem to have very clear-cut views; they are always straightforward, pragmatic and realistic; I believe they are a people who are very easy to be friends with,'' the emperor said. During his two-week visit with the empress, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> met government officials and farmers and dined with <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> stars. He had said the visit was the fulfillment of a 50-year-old dream. Although <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> admitted to a desire `` deep in my heart'' to become a common man and to be closer to his people, he also expressed his belief that `` most Japanese still have a respect for the imperial family.'' The imperial tradition has survived for centuries in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, he said, `` because, throughout history, the imperial family has always given first thought to the welfare of the people.'' The next emperor, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s son Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, `` may have his own ideas, but it has always been the tradition of the imperial family to act for the benefit of the people so I am also looking forward to such an attitude on his part as well,'' he said. The emperor hesitated to name influential people in his life, but did speak of his grandfather the Emperor <PERSON> Meiji </PERSON>. During the <LOCATION> Meiji </LOCATION> era -LRB- 1868 to 1912 -RRB-, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s grandfather played an important role in introducing public education and in modernizing his mostly agricultural nation. `` I always have kept his deeds in my mind,'' <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> said. The emperor said the saddest time of his life was during World War II. Unable to watch his people suffer further after the atomic bomb attacks on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> accepted Allied surrender terms in August 1945, urging his nation to `` bear the unbearable.'' `` At the time of the termination of the war, I made the decision on my own. That is because the Prime Minister failed to obtain agreement in the Cabinet and asked my opinion. So, I stated my opinion and then made the decision according to my opinion,'' <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> told <PERSON> Krisher </PERSON>. The emperor has never made a direct public admission that he opposed the war, maintaining that the constitution would not permit him to do so. `` Now at the time of the outbreak of the war and also before the war, when the Cabinet made decisions, I could not override their decisions,'' he said. <PERSON> Krisher </PERSON>'s interview went to press soon after he met <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. About a week later, the emperor met with a small group of foreign reporters, who had been outraged when the exclusive Newsweek article appeared. `` Nothing could top that interview,'' <PERSON> Krisher </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Once a familiar figure who often accompanied Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> in his travels, Empress <PERSON> Nagako </PERSON> in recent years has been confined to a wheelchair and seldom makes public appearances. The 85-year-old empress married <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, who died Saturday, nearly 65 years ago and would have celebrated her anniversary later this month. Born March 6, 1903, <PERSON> Nagako </PERSON> was the daughter of Imperial Prince <PERSON> Kuniyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuni </PERSON>. She was brought up in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, attending the elite Peer's School for Girls. She later received instruction from two <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quakers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> and <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON>, who were credited with inspiring many of the democratic changes which permeated the private life of the imperial family. Mrs. <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> also tutored Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> to his fluent English. At age 15, Princess <PERSON> Nagako </PERSON> was one of several prospective brides selected for <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, then crown prince. He chose her over the objections of some powerful court officials, including the <PERSON> Fujiwara </PERSON> family that traditionally supplied imperial brides. They tried to stop the engagement by producing medical records of color blindness in her mother's family, but doctors disputed the claims and <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> made it clear he already had decided. Once betrothed, the couple met only nine times during their six-year engagement. The wedding, set for 1923, was postponed after the Great Kanto Earthquake in September left much of the capital burned and in ruins. They were wed in an elaborate ceremony on Jan. 26, 1924. On Christmas Day in 1926, <PERSON> Nagako </PERSON> became empress of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> succeeded to the legendary Chryanthemum Throne on the death of his father, the <ORGANIZATION> Taisho </ORGANIZATION> emperor. Married longer than any imperial couple in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s history, she called him `` okami,'' or honorable master, and he affectionately referred to her as `` Naga-miya,'' Naga from her name and miya meaning princess. She gave birth to seven children. The first four were all girls, and court officials urged <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> to take a concubine to ensure there would be a male heir to the throne. But the emperor refused, and the next child was a boy, Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, who was born on Dec. 23, 1933. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitachi </PERSON> was born in 1935 and a fifth daughter in 1939. Two of their children died, a daughter during infancy and the eldest child, the former Princess <PERSON> Teru </PERSON>, at age 35 in 1961. The empress enjoys writing 31-syllable poems called `` waka,'' and plays the piano, violin and koto, a 13-stringed Japanese instrument. She studied painting under two of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s most respected artists, signing her work `` Toen,'' or Peach Garden. Collections of her works have been published in two volumes, and an exhibition of her drawings was held when she and <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1975. According to custom, she spent most of her time with her husband and family at the moated imperial palace in central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> or their mountain and seaside villas. She kept busy with various indoor duties, including newspaper clipping for the emperor and keeping track of greetings to foreign dignitaries, imperial household officials say. Confined by a back ailment and hip problems to a wheelchair, the empress in recent years has rarely appeared in public. But her smile, graceful wave and devotion to her husband have made her a familiar, grandmotherly figure to the Japanese.

 Multiple abdominal organ transplants are still in the early stages of development where failure is common, but hope remains high despite the death of another toddler following the risky surgery, experts say. `` We're in areas that are essentially unchartered,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, chief of pediatric surgery at Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` What we're doing is making tentative steps and then very carefully analyzing where we've been and what we've learned before we make any decision about the next one, when we'll do one or whether we'll do one.'' The fifth of six children in the country to undergo a multiple abdominal organ transplant died Friday. Three-year-old Rolandrea Dodge of <LOCATION> Fruitland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, survived six weeks with a transplanted liver, pancreas, stomach, small intestine and portion of a large intestine, and was awaiting another set of organs. Four other recipients died shortly after the transplants, and the sole survivor, <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliveira </PERSON>, 14 months, of <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was doing well Friday, despite a seizure earlier in the week and a bout of pneumonia, said Dr. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Alessandro </PERSON>, a transplant fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>. The boy received a small intestine and liver Dec. 31 at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and Clinics in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>. `` Every organ that's been transplanted has had its early problems,'' <PERSON> D'Alessandro </PERSON> said. `` There are hurdles that you have to go over and along the way you have to learn from everything that's been done in order for things to progress. The death of five patients is `` very disappointing,'' said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, director of transplantation at Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s Medical Center in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> `` But this is what happened in the early days of liver transplantation,'' he said. <PERSON> Rolandrea </PERSON>, better known as <PERSON> Rolly </PERSON>, was with her parents, <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodge </PERSON>, when she died in the hospital's intensive care unit. The child's chances of withstanding another five-organ transplant, providing a suitable donor could have been found, began to dwindle Friday as her condition swiftly deteriorated. Her name was placed back on the transplant waiting list Wednesday, four days after tests showed her small intestine was being rejected by her body's natural immune system. Doctors do not know whether any of the other four organs transplanted Nov. 29 were rejected or to what degree, <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> said. The child was born with a disorder that prevented her intestines from absorbing food and liquids. The nation's first multiple abdominal organ transplant was performed in 1983 by Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, who pioneered liver transplants. That first patient, a 6-year-old girl, lived only a few hours. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, questioned the ethics of the operation. `` Even if it worked well and people were living with a good quality of life, I'm still not sure there are enough potential donors,'' <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> said. `` It's very rare to have someone with five good organs. `` I'm also not sure society is going to view giving them all to a single person is the best thing to do. I do n't,'' he said. `` I think if you can spread the organs to more people, that is what should be done. The ethical principle should be to save the most lives.'' Intestines are especially difficult to transplant because of the extremely technical nature of the surgery, the lack of biological markers indicating organ rejection, and the bowel's ability, unique among organs, to counterattack the patient's immune system, <PERSON> D'Alessandro </PERSON> said. The longest survivor of a multiple organ abdominal transplant, <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 3 -LCB-, of <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, died last May, six months after receiving five organs at Children's Hospital. `` Unfortunately, many, many children are in desperate need of having this sort of operation,'' <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't possibly think about the success and failure. What we're thinking about is trying to have a child who has a fatal disease ... and trying to have them live and have a good life.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, who becomes <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s first emperor to ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne as a human and not a living god, has quietly transformed the cloistered monarchy into a popular symbol of the people. The gray-haired <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> has waited 55 years to take up the imperial mantle. A gracious, self-effacing man schooled among commoners, he has spent those years maturing with his country. As <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> lay dying, the prince assumed the full roster of the emperor's official duties on Sept. 22. The prince's daily shuttles from his residence near the forested imperial compound to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s deathbed drew swarms of photographers. Whether in predawn darkness or afternoon drizzle, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>'s face showed the same stoic deference to the ailing monarch, and court physicians listening outside the imperial chamber reported quiet conversations between father and son. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> took on the imperial duties once before as <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> recuperated from intestinal bypass surgery in September 1987. He retained a few responsibilities but returned most after the emperor's recovery. Those duties include affixing the imperial seal to government laws and appointments, opening sessions of parliament and receiving foreign ambassadors. To these the prince has added frequent visits to factory openings, festivals and various observances across <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. And with numerous trips abroad as his father's proxy, he has almost single-handedly brought <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s monarchy into the global age and the eye of a curious public. `` I want to be a man with a strong moral backbone with keen, reliable insight and knowledge,'' he once reportedly told a friend. `` I want to shake up the imperial protocol system.'' <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> set his most spectacular imperial precedent with his marriage in 1959 to a commoner. <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoda </PERSON> was the beautiful, cultured daughter of a wealthy miller, and the young prince courted her by phone in a widely reported romance that was conservative, but refreshingly typical. The match shocked the imperial retinue and thrilled the public. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> gave his consent and the couple married after a cavalcade that drew 500,000 gawking subjects onto the streets of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> and his princess produced three children: <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiro </PERSON>, who at 28 is next in the imperial succession; <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Aya </PERSON>, 22, and 19-year-old Princess Nori. They broke another imperial tradition with their decision to raise the children by themselves. Born Dec. 23, 1933, as a militaristic <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> geared for growing confrontation in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> was shuttled among the imperial family's countryside villas when American planes began firebombing <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in the closing months of the war. He was still short of his 12th birthday when his father's armies were crushed and the nation suffered the ultimate defeat in 1945. At the urging of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> occupation officials, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> also surrendered the divinity that had been the birthright of every Japanese monarch, and agreed to a new constitutional role as `` the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people, deriving his position from the will of the people.'' <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> took his role seriously. `` The imperial family should always be passive,'' he has said. `` The most important thing is the will of the people.'' Having inherited a centuries-old legacy of passive monarchs, his job may have been made easier. The prince, who was invested as heir to the throne in an unprecedented public ceremony in 1952, soon set off to represent his father on state visits around the globe, including the coronation of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in 1953. With <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> he has visited at least 41 countries in 22 official trips to `` deepen understanding mutually and promote friendship between the peoples,'' he has said. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> shares his father's proclivity for science and is a respected scholar of gobiid fish, a mudsucker.

<HEAD>California Tobacco Tax Hike Means Coughing Up More Cash for Smokes</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> smokers and smokeshop owners are fuming over a week-old tobacco tax increase that boosts the cost of a pack of cigarettes from a vending machine to $ 2 or more. The tax, approved by voters in November and effective Jan. 1, jumped from a dime to 35 cents on a pack of cigarettes and raised the price of cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff and pipe tobacco by 42 percent. `` They're leaving here screaming,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON>, a clerk at <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>'s Grocery in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` They're saying ` No way.' They storm out the door. They think it's only me raising the price. I tell them, ` You voted for it.''' The hike makes <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s tobacco tax one of the nation's highest <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s tax of 38 cents a pack on cigarettes is tops; by contrast, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, where tobacco is the leading cash crop, charges a mere 2 cents a pack. The tax increase coincided with price increases from many wholesalers and a new federal tax of 45 cents a pound on tobacco. Some manufacturers are charging 75 cents a pound more for pipe tobacco and 5 to 15 cents more for each cigar. A pack of regular domestic cigarettes that sold for about $ 1.50 two weeks ago is now selling for $ 1.75 over some counters, $ 2 to $ 2.25 in vending machines and $ 3 at Candlestick Park concession stands. At one smoke shop, the price of a 14-ounce package of pipe tobacco jumped from $ 10.56 to $ 18.16. The tax is expected to generate $ 650 million in revenue to be spent for health care for the indigent, research on smoking-caused diseases, smoking prevention education and fire prevention. It was approved by a 58 percent to 42 percent margin. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Merryman </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> said no one really knows how many people may cut back on smoking or quit, but the longterm economic impact on the industry undoubtedly will be negative. `` I think it's a brutal tax. You do n't see this sort of tax on alcohol,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adami </PERSON>, whose family has run the <ORGANIZATION> Smoke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> at </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> for 18 years. Cigarette sales are down, <PERSON> Adami </PERSON> said, but faring even worse are high-quality cigars. Cigars that sold for about $ 63 a box a year ago are about $ 100 now. She blamed the declining sales on the tax increase, New Year's resolutions by many smokers to quit and end-of-the-year stockpiling <PERSON> Adami </PERSON> said many customers are stoic: `` The answer I get is, ` This will separate the men from the boys.''' `` It was amazing how many cigarettes we were selling during the last week of the year,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Ramona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> and Liquor in <LOCATION> Chino </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The manufacturers couponed their products. With everybody stockpiling, I think they did pretty good at getting rid of their old inventory.'' At a tobacco shop in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cerrito </LOCATION>, about 15 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, an owner who asked not to be identified said he sold only two packs of cigarettes between New Year's Day and late Thursday. `` This is a state tax that is killing me and killing me,'' he said, adding that he may shut down unless business improves. He contended that election advertising for the proposition stressed taxes on cigarettes alone. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wharton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Smokewatchers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> director and longtime leader of stop-smoking clinics, doubted that higher prices affect the habits of hardcore smokers. `` The biggest thing that motivates people to stop smoking is peer pressure ... more than all the health scares, surgeon general's warnings or price,'' he said At The <ORGANIZATION> Tinder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, a woman who asked not to be named said, `` My mother told me if it was $ 2 a cigarette, she'd still smoke.'' Researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> issued a report Thursday saying that smoking is more of a mark of the poor and less educated and has declined across all educational groups. The researchers also said fewer than 10 percent of college graduates will smoke in the year 2000, but at least 30 percent of those with no more than a high school education will. More than 50 million Americans smoke. Smoking-related deaths claim 390,000 lives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> annually, according to <PERSON> Joann </PERSON> <PERSON> Schellenbach </PERSON>, a spokeswoman with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he will go before a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> soon after his Jan. 20 inauguration to spell out his idea of a `` flexible freeze'' on spending to bring down the federal budget deficit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who still has two Cabinet-level vacancies to fill, announced a series of nominations for top ambassadorships and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> jobs Friday, including the selection of his longtime national security adviser, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, as ambassador to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He also named <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, a protege and associate of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, as his choice for deputy secretary of state. The Gregg nomination could spark controversy because of the involvement of the former career <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officer in the Iran-Contra affair while serving on the vice president's staff <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was spending this weekend out of the public eye, with no indication of when he will name an energy secretary and appoint a drug-czar. The president-elect surprised his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> on their 44th wedding anniversary by taking her out to dinner Friday night with friends at a posh <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> restaurant, <PERSON> Tiberio </PERSON>'s, followed by a trip to the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> to see the play, `` Sheer Madness,'' a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>, said. Earlier Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters he will unveil ideas for reducing the deficit to a special joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after his inauguration. He gave no specific date. While expressing support for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to back a 50 percent pay increase for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and other top federal officials, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he may revisit the pay question when he is president. `` I do n't know whether we can afford anything other than to get this deficit under control,'' he said, adding that when `` the buck is stopping on my desk, I may have something else to say'' about it. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> was a career foreign service officer who rose to the No. 3 job in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, undersecretary for political affairs, in 1982 before retiring in 1984 to join <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> in a consulting business. He is currently president of <ORGANIZATION> Kissinger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The transition office also announced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will nominate <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Catto </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> protocol chief, as ambassador to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, as ambassador to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a brief exchange with reporters, said <LOCATION> Iran-Contra </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> `` did the right thing'' in moving to drop two key charges against <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> because of national security concerns. `` I think he properly found that there are legitimate national security interests that need to be protected,'' said the vice president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will not make a formal State of the Union address until next year, but aides say they expect the new president to address <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a few weeks after the Jan. 20 inauguration. Pressed for details of his proposed spending freeze, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` I'll tell you when I take my message up to a joint session of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is sending <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a lame-duck, $ 1.2 trillion budget for fiscal 1990 on Monday. Administration officials say it will hold the deficit to $ 92 billion. `` I wo n't have time to submit a budget this thick,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, holding his hands a foot apart. `` But I will have time to analyze the president's proposals _ a budget, incidentally, that will go up there without raising taxes _ and say, ` Here's what I'll add here and take off a little there,' something of that nature.'' The 1990 budget year begins Oct. 1 of this calendar year. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will propose eliminating 80 programs, many of them survivors of past <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hit lists. `` I hasten to emphasize that this is a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration budget and not a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration budget,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, who will also be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will make some alterations and change some priorities, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` but this is not a good-cop, bad-cop exercise.'' Friday's <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appointments include five top positions at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s secretary of state-designate, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. In addition to <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, the others nominated for State posts are: _ <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoellick </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official under <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, to be counselor He served as issues director for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign. _ <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, to be assistant secretary for public affairs and spokeswoman for State She is a former assistant <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary who also served under <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> at the White House. _ <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, assistant secretary for legislative affairs She is currently director of congressional relations for the president-elect and was deputy national political director and media director of his campaign. _ <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, director of the policy planning staff with ambassadorial rank He was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser during the campaign and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff from 1986 to 1988.

 In a modest tent surrounded by crumbling palaces where Ethiopian emperors reigned for 250 years, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> official appealed for funds to rebuild the grandeur of this Marxist state's feudal past. `` These sites are part of our universal cultural heritage,'' <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> told Western ambassadors, international donors and representatives of other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies Thursday. `` The history of this region is as imposing as the historical remains are impressive.'' The director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization arrived in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s capital Wednesday to dramatize the need for $ 14.5 million for <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s 10-year program to restore palaces, monasteries, castles and other monuments that <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> has declared heritages of mankind Mayor immediately flew to <LOCATION> Gondar </LOCATION>, 285 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, a city graced by palaces and castles built by emperors who ruled between 1632 and 1868. Palaces such as <LOCATION> Gondar </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> are in need of restoration because they have been used continuously for two or more centuries. <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> Beit </PERSON> is an 18th century edifice used as offices of President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON>'s government. Some monuments were nearly destroyed in warfare between different dynasties and in resistance to foreign invasions. Others fell into disrepair because of neglect. In need of repair are the 11 fantastical churches hewn from rock in northern <LOCATION> Lalibella </LOCATION> town, monasteries around <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tana </LOCATION>, the source of the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nile </ORGANIZATION>, and the granite-carved obelisks of <LOCATION> Axum </LOCATION> which once rose 13 storys high. Axum's tallest obelisk, an intricately carved stone column that once stretched up 100 feet, has fallen. The tallest still standing is more than 75 feet high, the height of a 10-story building. They were built when a a flourishing kingdom existed around 500 B.C. in <LOCATION> Axum </LOCATION>, 341 miles north of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> in wartorn <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> province. The king and his subjects embraced <ORGANIZATION> Coptic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christianity </ORGANIZATION> in 330 A.D. During the Middle Ages this kingdom gave way, through palace feuds and intrigues, to others in the south. However by 1636, <LOCATION> Gondar </LOCATION> had become the capital of centralized authority in the mountainous region, giving <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> a political entity long before European colonization. <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s monuments `` are treasures, a legacy of civilizations spanning more than 40 centuries. `` Anyone who sees the state into which the masterworks have fallen would shudder and move into action to preserve these and other jewels of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s past for the common enrichment of present and future generations,'' he said. He appealed to the international community to contribute money, equipment and services for the restoration. The 50-state Organization of African Unity announced from its <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> headquarters the first donation of $ 10,000 to help restore treasures of one of the continent's most ancient civilizations. Ethiopian Culture Minister <PERSON> Ghirma </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilma </PERSON> said his country's rich cultural history had attracted scholars from many parts of the world. Ethiopian artifacts and art are to be found in museums all over the world, he noted. <PERSON> Ghirma </PERSON> said the government, established after a 1974 coup ousted the late Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON>, was keen to see the ancient monuments restored. <LOCATION> Gondar </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lalibella </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Axum </LOCATION> form the Ethiopian Tourist Orgnization's `` northern historic route.'' However, tourism there has been handicapped since the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Tigrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> took up arms against the government 14 years ago, demanding more autonomy for the province. <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> took issue with reporters who asked whether money spent on restoration of ancient monuments could not be better spent on people affected by natural calamities like the droughts and famines which intermittently afflict the East African nation. `` Guaranteeing opportunities to learn about and share our common heritage is also indispensable,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tower In Good Condition After Colon Surgery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The physician who operated on former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> said the colon surgery should n't interfere with his serving as secretary of defense in President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s cabinet. `` Sen. Tower is in excellent health and he should expect a 100 percent recovery,'' Dr. <PERSON> R.D </PERSON> <PERSON> Dignan </PERSON> said Friday. `` And I see no reason whatsoever why he ca n't pick up where he left off.'' <PERSON> Dignan </PERSON> and other doctors removed a polyp and a one-foot section of Tower's colon during a three-hour operation Thursday. The polyp and section of colon appear to be benign, doctors said, although final reports from an analysis of the growth and tissue were not expected to be available until today. There is little chance of previously detected malignant cells resurfacing, <PERSON> Dignan </PERSON> added. Tower, 63, appointed defense secretary-designate by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Dec. 16, was listed in good condition Friday night, hospital officials said. The former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator is expected to remain hospitalized another seven or eight days, and <PERSON> Dignan </PERSON> has recommended that he rest in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> another four or five days after being released. Doctors discovered the colon polyp Dec. 27 when physicians performed a colonoscopy and removed a cancerous rectal polyp they had discovered in November. `` All of the malignant cells from the rectal polyp have been removed and there is nothing but a high likelihood that a cure has been achieved. I think it would be the remotest possibility that he would have any additional trouble,'' <PERSON> Dignan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dignan </PERSON> said the surgical procedure is standard for a broad-base polyp and similar to surgery performed on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Physicians also removed lymph nodes and a small portion of Tower's small intestine. Tower must return for regular examinations to insure that other polyps do not develop, but will not be expected to make any changes in his diet or take any prescription medicine. Tower, who retired in 1985 after 24 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, served as an arms negotiator for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and headed the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s Iran-Contra investigative panel.

 When Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> announced <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surrender over the radio in 1945, his voice, until then unheard by commoners, shocked a nation battered by countless bombings and exhausted by a war it could not win. But later in his reign, the emperor's voice and appearances on television became part of the nation's yearly routine, showing the transformation of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s role from aloof god to gentle symbol. Retired shopkeeper <PERSON> Tadashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujii </PERSON> recalled the emperor's Aug. 15 announcement: `` When I heard the broadcast I just did n't believe it. I could n't believe it was the emperor.'' <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujii </PERSON>, 65, then in the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, `` Some people thought he was a god. We were educated to think of him as a deity, but when we heard his voice on the radio with all the static, many of us were just relieved that -LRB- the war -RRB- was all over, that we could go home.'' When <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> assumed the throne in 1926, the ancient idea that the emperor was a direct descendant of the sun goddess had been rejuvenated and hammered into the minds of the Japanese by 19th-century reformers who sought to overthrow feudalism and justify their `` modern'' approach to government. The reformers realized that though the emperor and imperial family have rarely wielded power, no government has been able to rule without their tacit approval. Historians agree that the emperors of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have not held real power since the ninth century. The Meiji Restoration of 1868 is named after the <PERSON> Meiji </PERSON> emperor, but he was then only 15, and it was his ministers who made all the changes that created modern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The reformers' constitution of 1889, on paper at least, declared <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s grandfather, the <LOCATION> Meiji </LOCATION> emperor, to be sacred, inviolable and the <ORGANIZATION> supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> authority </ORGANIZATION> in all matters of government. Wartime militarists built on the god-emperor image, turning it into impetus to keep the nation fighting. In the war's final days, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> did assert himself, telling generals: `` I can not bear to see my innocent people suffer any longer.'' The postwar constitution, largely imposed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> occupation authorities, redefined the emperor's role. He became `` the symbol'' of the state and of the people. The emperor himself told the nation he was not a divinity in 1946. During the Allied occupation, Gen. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> chose to deny a request by the emperor to step down and take responsibility for the war, opting instead to get him out among the people to help create an egalitarian society. The emperor responded in 1946 by embarking on a 165-day trek around the country, covering all provinces but <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>. `` His travels in the provinces right after the war played a key role in boosting morale and unifying the Japanese,'' said <PERSON> Toshiaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawahara </PERSON>, a journalist and author specializing in the imperial family. `` He met the people, talked to them.'' And the imperial will as interpreted by <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> continued long after the occupation ended in 1952 and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> took control of its own destiny. `` The emperor served as a symbol and a uniting factor in the nation's redevelopment,'' <PERSON> Kawahara </PERSON> said. By opening the Chrysanthemum Throne to an extent never before seen, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s postwar reign also symbolized the nation's growing democratization, <PERSON> Kawahara </PERSON> said. Each year since 1958, to celebrate the New Year and <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s birthday on April 29, the grounds of the Imperial Palace in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> were opened to swarms of Japanese seeking a glimpse of the monarch, who would wave and give a short speech One year after these public appearances began, the emperor allowed his son, Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, to marry a commoner. The break with tradition greatly enhanced the popularity of the imperial family. But direct contact with common Japanese became more infrequent as <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> aged. The ambivalence of the nation's young people toward the emperor and the imperial system was reflected by a 25-year-old office worker, <PERSON> Toshiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kodama </PERSON>, who said: `` I feel nothing but pity for him. He was so weak.''

<HEAD>Wave of Polish Sailors Jumps Ship in Boston</HEAD>

 A Polish trawler captain who was afraid his sailors might try to jump ship in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> refused to enter the port, but 16 crewmen determined to flee their homeland simply hopped aboard a refueling barge. The sailors' decision to jump ship Thursday was the latest in a wave of defections that immigration officials say is unusual and puzzling. Forty-eight sailors, all members of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s banned Solidarity union, have fled from three Polish fishing vessels in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in the last month, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials said. `` Ship jumping is a very common occurrence in all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports. But even so, I do n't remember hearing of these kind of numbers,'' said <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON> said he could not understand the defections, because `` if anything, things in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have improved in recent years.'' The sailors, who applied for political asylum Friday, said the decision was easy, the opportunity difficult. Between bites of pepperoni pizza at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Polish-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Waliszewski </PERSON>, 36, said he had been thinking for more than two years of defecting to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and decided to make the jump as soon as the trawler Kantar reached <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>. However, he and his shipmates feared their chance might slip away when the captain canceled a two-day shore leave for the 57-man crew and refused to enter <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s inner harbor. `` He said there would be no leave, because they were worried about more defections,'' <PERSON> Waliszewski </PERSON> said through an interpreter. `` So he stayed out in the harbor, but he had to send for a fuel barge. `` At that point, when we saw the barge coming, we went to the captain and told him there were 12 of us who were going to defect, no matter what,'' he said. `` We asked for our passports and other documents. He refused to give them to us ... but we were determined and we just took our bags and left.'' <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryzianowka </PERSON>, 27, said the captain warned the defectors that their families in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would face hefty fines, but he did not physically try to block them. `` Even if the captain had wanted to, he could n't have gotten anyone to help him,'' <PERSON> Kryzianowka </PERSON> said. Not all the defectors got away at once. The barge pulled away after the first dozen men had jumped onto it. The other four jumped ship when it returned three hours later. Polish-American families have offered to take the sailors in while the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> reviews their applications for political asylum, said <PERSON> Cathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> MacInnes </PERSON>, an immigration consultant to the city. All the sailors will receive temporary work permits, but permanent asylum will be granted only if they can prove they would face persecution upon their return to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Thirteen Polish sailors who fled two vessels after docking in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in January 1988, were granted political asylum by April under what the federal government considers an expedited process, Ms. <PERSON> MacInnes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Waliszewski </PERSON> said most of the sailors left wives and children behind, but are hopeful that their families will be allowed to join them eventually. `` Of course, it's very hard,'' he said. `` I did talk about it with my wife, but at this point she does n't know I actually am here. We all have families, and we're all thinking about them now.''

 727s. <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. wants airlines to replace thousands of rivets on more than 600 older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s. The goverment also wants them to initiate inspection procedures until the modifications can be completed. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> estimated Friday that the repairs and extra inspections of 623 older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s will cost the airlines approximately $ 35.7 million. The proposed directive on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s requires that airlines over the next four years replace from 3,300 to 4,150 rivets, depending on the model of 727 involved. It said the `` countersunk'' rivets now on the planes are believed to cause cracking under some circumstances, while the substitute `` button-head'' is less likely to do so. The proposed <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directive is similar to an order issued last October for older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s. A final order will not be issued until after a brief comment period. tps @

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> engaged in a verbal dogfight in the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> over the authenticity of photos that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says prove a Libyan MiG was armed when it was shot down by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jets. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy said Friday the photographs clearly show a <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> aircraft armed with missiles, not _ as he put it _ `` a bouquet of flowers.'' He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pilots acted in self-defense after using evasive air maneuvers five times to try to avoid the approaching jets. The Libyan envoy called the photographs `` fakes ... fabricated pictures ... directed in a Hollywood manner'' by actors and clever editors. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says the planes were unarmed reconnaissance craft. The already bad relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> worsened in recent weeks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assertions that Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s government is ready to begin production of chemical weapons in a desert factory outside <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says the plant is designed to make pharmaceuticals. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> dramatically exhibited two blurred photographs Friday that he said showed missiles under the wings and fuselage of one of the two Soviet-built MiG-23s shot down by two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-14 Tomcats on Wednesday over international waters of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they believe the other plane was similarly armed. The photographs were passed around the council during the session, which <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> had sought in order to condemn the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The session adjourned until Monday morning. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its British ally are expected to veto the resolution of condemnation drafted by the 101-nation Non-Aligned Movement. About 25 speakers, mostly from Arab and non-aligned nations, have denounced the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> session. No one has supported it, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies have not yet spoken. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government wants to provoke a Libyan retaliation so it can launch a full-scale attack. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes raided two <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> cities in 1986 to retaliate for purported Libyan support of terrorism in connection with the bombing of a West German disco frequented by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen. A spokesman for Libyan Information Minister <PERSON> Rajab </PERSON> <PERSON> Abou </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabbous </PERSON> said Friday that 14 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes _ not two _ attacked the Libyan craft. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the photographs were taken from videotape of the encounter made by the pilot of one of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft. It says they show two views of a single aircraft armed with Aphid and Apex missiles. However, not everyone was convinced on Friday. Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> told the council that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action was `` absolutely unfounded.'' He said the photographs were blurred and added, `` It's immaterial whether the Libyan planes carried any missiles or were just pure reconnaissance planes. ... We can not recognize the right of a military plane of one country to shoot down a military aircraft of another country just because they both happen to be very close to each other in international airspace.'' `` I'm not going to get into a hassle over the quality of image,'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> retorted after <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> criticized his evidence. `` The important thing is that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft made five evasive maneuvers to turn away from the oncoming MiGs. `` If you are walking down a dark alley at night and you see a man who has a gun, and you cross the street and he crosses the street, you slow down and he slows down, you speed up and he speeds up, you've got to realize that he's not coming to present you with a bouquet of flowers,'' said <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes were on a routine mission and acted in self-defense. However, the Libyan envoy reminded the 15-member council that in July a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship shot down an Iranian commercial airliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> because crewmen mistakenly believed it to be an attacking warplane. All 290 people on the plane were killed. `` We are in the country of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>,'' he told reporters. `` It is very well edited, very well done _ and it is not true.''

<TEXT>
 A man who hijacked a jetliner to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and spent five years in prison there has been sentenced to spend another five years in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prison. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>, 31, of suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, received the sentence Friday from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Zloch </PERSON>, who rejected a federal probation officer's recommendation to let <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> remain free on probation. <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> hijacked an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> on July 7, 1983, when he was 26 years old and reportedly fascinated with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Less than 24 hours earlier, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said it had received word that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was cracking down on hijackers and that any sky pirates landing there could expect to spend 50 years in a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> prison. When <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in June, he pleaded innocent to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges. He later changed his plea. <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>'s odyssey began when he boarded <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> Flight 8 at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale-Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. He used a fake bomb to force the crew to take the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> instead of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, its scheduled destination. Air Florida is now defunct. <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> was arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He probably would still be in the prison in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> if not for the efforts of his father, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>. Neither <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>'s father nor the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> have discussed how <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>'s release was achieved But the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has insisted that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was not involved in the negotiations.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has turned south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> into a detention camp with a ruling that prevents Central American immigrants from traveling to other areas to apply for asylum, a lawsuit contends. The lawsuit, filed Friday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, seeks to reverse Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> rules of Dec. 16 that made it impossible for most asylum-seekers to leave south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or work while waiting 30 days for approval or denial of their claims. `` In essence, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has been transformed into a de facto detention area and asylum applicants are trapped there,'' says the lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of Central Americans and other asylum-seekers in the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> at the southern tip of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Before Dec. 16, asylum-seekers in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> were allowed to travel to their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destinations to apply for asylum, often <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials said they adopted the new procedure in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> to reduce huge case backlogs in those cities and to curb abuses of the system that delayed processing for legitimate asylum cases. At least 30,000 Central Americans passed through the area last year, according to <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> figures. Most of them enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally in the <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> area of the Lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, the nearest land point to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Due to the new policy to process these cases in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, severe backlogs have been created and hundreds of refugees are forced to sleep overnight on the sidewalk outside the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office so as not to lose their place in line,'' the lawsuit said. `` Many are sleeping in empty lots and eating from garbage bins. Many are traveling with small children who also are forced to endure winter elements without shelter.'' The lawsuit names <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> as defendants. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> declined to comment. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Filemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> has agreed to hear a motion Monday for a temporary restraining order, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, managing attorney for the Immigrant and <ORGANIZATION> Refugee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. The order would again allow asylum-seekers to pursue their cases at their destinations, where the attorneys said many have families and friends to help them. The lawsuit accuses the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> of implementing a policy change without publishing it in the Federal Register for public comment; of denying aliens access to the asylum process and access to counsel; and improperly restricting the right to work.

 Prosecutors in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement investigation say an initial 27-count indictment is just the start of an expected wave of court activity in the prosecution phase of Operation Ill Wind. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> said the pace of the investigation that began more than two years ago is moving with unprecedented speed, given the complexity of the case. `` In the next few months you will see a great deal of additional activity,'' he said. On Friday, a federal grand jury filed the first charges in the procurement case, accusing a defense contractor, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> employee and five other men with crimes including conspiracy, bribery and theft of government property. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, who is leading the nationwide investigation into the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 150 billion-a-year purchasing system, said the indictment `` strikes at the very heart'' of alleged corruption in the procurement process. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> official, said the `` No. 1 priority'' of the bureau's white collar crime program is fraud in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The 86-page indictment focuses on activities alleged to have been undertaken by <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a branch of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and three men: <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> procurement specialist <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> and private consultants <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> acquisitions official. Specifically, the indictment charges that <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> and three of its officers agreed to pay <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> $ 160,000 to assist them in obtaining a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contract related to radar worth $ 100 million. The indictment contends <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> paid <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>, a California-based private consultant, who `` in turn paid <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> ... for his assistance in manipulating the procurement process to insure that the ... contract was awarded to <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> participated in various decisions within the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> affecting the contract and is accused of giving <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> advance information so the company could tailor its bids, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. If convicted of all charges, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> could face maximum penalties of 185 years in prison and fines of $ 5.5 million each, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> told a news conference. <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> faces a fine of up to $ 6.5 million. Also named in the indictment were <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> employees <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnittjer </PERSON>. They could face confinement ranging between 50 and 85 years and fines of up to $ 2.5 million if convicted on all counts. The overall conspiracy charge says the defendants worked together to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, to bribe a public official, to make false statements and to commit wire fraud. In advance of the indictment, <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Patten </PERSON>, said the company had been offered a deal by the government but was unsatisfied with the terms. Attorneys for <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> have contended their clients did nothing wrong and would be vindicated in court. Before the indictment was returned, another company, <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Emerson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to plead guilty in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to conspiracy to defraud the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, conversion of government property and making false statements to the government, company attorney <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> said. Under terms of the agreement <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION>, which is cooperating with the government, agreed to pay fines of nearly $ 2 million, including court costs. Two former <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> employees, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Colarusso </PERSON>, 58, who was the company's senior vice president, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Furciniti </PERSON>, 54, who was a marketing representative, also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the government and commit wire fraud. The maximum sentence they could face is five years in jail and a $ 250,000 fine. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> set sentencing for March 17. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaides </PERSON>, 41, an employee of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery. He, too, could be sentenced to five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. Prosecutors said those pleading guilty had agreed to cooperate with the government in exchange for reduced charges. All had a relationship with <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>, the consultants who allegedly paid bribes to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Investigators said <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> hired <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> to obtain inside information from <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees that would allow the company to compete for a $ 15.9 million contract for battlefield equipment. <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that it `` has already taken additional steps to enforce its longstanding requirement of ethical business behavior and to guard against such incidents in the future.'' Federal agents used telephone wiretaps in the case, which was first made public last June when agents searched offices and homes of people suspected to be involved. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, defense officials said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is `` reviewing all information released in connection with the indictments announced ... by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to determine any necessary action regarding <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> programs, personnel, contractors or consultants.''

 <LOCATION> WILKES-BARRE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A former minister charged in the starvation death of his son did not buy food with the $ 3,700 he was saving for God, but never gave the money to the church, either, police and church leaders said. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> were charged Thursday with murdering their son, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>, 14, who was found by police Wednesday in the <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON>'s modest <LOCATION> Nuangola </LOCATION> home, just outside <LOCATION> Wilkes-Barre </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> The 5-foot-10 teen-ager weighed 69 pounds. Police said they found no food in the house, but <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> turned over $ 2,131 in cash, two $ 50 savings bonds, a savings account book showing a balance of $ 1,281 and a checkbook showing a balance of $ 263. <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> told police the family had not eaten since Nov. 22. `` <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> said he did not spend the money because it did not belong to them,'' according to an affidavit by state Trooper <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` He stated that the money was ` tithe' money and belonged to God.'' <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> told police all four family members had discussed using the tithe to buy food but decided against it, according to the affidavit. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, first elder at the Seventh-day Adventist church near <LOCATION> Nuangola </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> had not paid a tithe to the church since the family moved to <LOCATION> Nuangola </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> area in 1985. Pastor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, who works at the church's state headquarters in Reading, said tithes are standard for Seventh-Day Adventists, but not at the expense of a believer's family. `` We do n't believe in starving people,'' <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said. `` We do n't believe you should neglect your family for your tithe. Seventh-day Adventists are fundamentally evangelical and take the Bible as their sole rule of faith and practice. <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON>, 39, a former Seventh-day Adventist pastor was fired from his job as a truck driver in March. The couple and their 12-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON>, were listed in serious condition Friday with varying degrees of malnutrition, dehydration and vitamin deficiencies. In addition to the criminal homicide charges, the Cottams face two counts each of recklessly endangering another person and two counts each of endangering the welfare of children. They could get the death penalty if convicted on the homicide charge. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Luzerne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> filed a petition Friday to take custody of <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> was hired as pastor of four local Seventh-day Adventist churches six years ago. He was transfered to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> when he could n't get along with the congregation, <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> said. He lost the post in 1985 and his pastor's license with the church, and the family moved back to <LOCATION> Nuangola </LOCATION>. `` I think they took the Lord and tested him to the extreme,'' said <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>. `` You know, I know, everybody knows food do n't fall out of the sky.''

 World leaders from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s king mourned today's death of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, who surrendered a broken nation to the Allies in World War II but presided over its rise to economic pre-eminence. Reaction to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death at age 87, however, was decidedly cool in several <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, including <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which endured years of harsh colonial rule by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. While <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-Woo </PERSON> sent his condolences, a government party statement added, `` We reserve further comment, considering the unhappy past and the current Korea-Japan relationship.'' The main opposition party led by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> said, `` We have complex feelings at the death of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> in view of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 20-year rule over <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> during his reign.'' A leading newspaper in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> Joong-Ang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, wrote that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death `` reminds all the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people of a disgraced period and ... humiliation. ... <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> is the symbolic figure who must assume most and final responsibility for -LRB- <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s -RRB- preposterous crimes to the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people.'' <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was divided into the communist north and the capitalist south in 1945, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops ended <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s rule that began in 1910 with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s forced annexation of the peninsula. There was no official comment from the nationalist <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government because of the lack of diplomatic relations between <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but the mass circulation Chinese daily <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said: `` <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> people who suffered from the slavery and invasion of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s militarists during World War II may bury their animosity with <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death. ... Chinese suffered the most from the Japanese invasion. `` It was an irony that while <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> apologized to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for the war, he did not direct a single word to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to show his sorrow. Now, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has We may not want to collect the reparations, but we shall never forget the painful historic lessions.'' In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a statement, `` His Majesty's 62-year reign spanned one of the most tumultuous, and yet at the same time constructive eras in the history of mankind _ an age of unprecedented economic collapse, a most vicious war, astonishing scientific acheivement, and dramatic political and social changes throughout the world. `` It was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation. His Majesty played a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two peoples to an end,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, referring to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s decision to end World War II. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death marks the end of an era. `` During his reign he saw the transition from the most turbulent period in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s modern history to the stability and prosperity of today,'' <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> sent condolences to the imperial family and her foreign secretary, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, a Japanese prisoner of war during World War II, praised <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> as `` a stabilizing factor'' in the creation of a democratic <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` He provided a figurehead that kept the Japanese people firmly committed to peaceful means of achieving their national goals,'' <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said. Condolences also came from King <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmood </PERSON> <PERSON> Iskandar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s oldest son, Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, who immediately ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne. Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> paid his respects in a message to Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noburu </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>: `` Throughout his long life, the emperor was held in the highest esteem by his people. Now, as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> enters a period of mourning and prepares for a new age, our thoughts are with you.'' But <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruxton </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Returned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, which representing almost 300,000 Australian war veterans, said there would not `` be too many tears shed around the world.'' He described <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, whose role in the war has been debated, as `` one of the worst war criminals.''

He had to be emperor first, then second a scientist and normal human being,'' <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The majority of public television stations will carry national prime-time programs on the same night beginning this fall. The move is intended to assist viewers confused by <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> programs appearing on different nights in different cities, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of PBS. `` -LRB- It's -RRB- a move to a coherent national schedule,'' <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said at a television critics convention. Ninety percent of PBS stations will reserve two hours Sunday through Thursday night for designated national programs, <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said. Individual stations are free to run national programs at any time between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. on the specified night. The goal of the same-night schedule, <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said, is to capitalize fully on PBS program reviews appearing in national publications and, therefore, improve slumping PBS ratings.

<HEAD>New Emperor's Reign To Be Known As `Heisei'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANICE FUHRMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s new imperial era was formally named `` Heisei'' _ or Achieving Peace _ to set a new tone for Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>'s reign after the turbulence of his father's 62-year epoch, the government announced today. Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> announced the new name, which will be used on calendars and official documents. Under a 1979 law, and a custom dating back 1,300 years, a new name is assigned when a new emperor ascends <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 2,600-year-old Chrysanthemum Throne. Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> died today of intestinal cancer after a 3 -LCB- - month illness He was 87. His oldest son, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, 55, immediately succeeded him. `` Heisei'' was chosen for <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>'s reign because the word, consisting of two Chinese characters, `` includes the meaning of achieving peace domestically, internationally and in heaven,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said in a statement. `` I think it is the most appropriate era name to reflect the coming ` new age,''' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said. The new era officially begins Sunday, with this year becoming <ORGANIZATION> Heisei </ORGANIZATION> 1. The name was approved by <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s Cabinet today, and <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> signed with a calligraphy brush to give the measure formal effect. Reflecting <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s postwar democratic constitution, private citizens were included for the first time on the council that recommended three names for the new era to the Cabinet. The group also included <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers, <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officials and scholars. The opinion of the new emperor was not given much weight. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s reign, which began Dec. 25, 1926, was known as <PERSON> Showa </PERSON>, the era of `` enlightened peace.'' By the Japanese calendar, this year was Showa 64. During the <LOCATION> Showa </LOCATION> era, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> saw his nation plunge into World War II and suffer history's first atomic attack, announced its surrender, and later saw it rise to economic superpower status. On the death of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s longest-reigning monarch, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> succeeded automatically to the throne, becoming the 125th emperor in the world's oldest imperial line _ held by the same family since at least the 8th century and by legend since 660 B.C. In a ceremony a few hours after <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> died, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> received three sacred treasures _ a sword, jewels and the imperial seal _ that have been handed down through the centuries. Other ceremonies were expected to extend over at least two years, ending with the formal enthronement. A debate over naming the eras of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s emperors had flared between opposition parties and the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which revived the era-naming clause in 1979 after it was dropped from the postwar constitution. The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> favor the exclusive use of the Western calendar and charge that naming eras violates the constitutional provision that sovereignty rests with the Japanese people. The era-naming tradition was imported from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and reflected a belief that the sovereign controlled time itself.

<TEXT>
 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> played a major role in ending World War II between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to documents in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> archives. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> paid tribute to the actions of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> in helping to end the the hostilities and leading the Japanese people through reconstruction after the mikado died on Friday. The Japanese account of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s role in the last days of the war was first made public when the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1969 issued the 1945 volume in its continuing series of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic documents. Historians regard his acts then as one factor influencing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision against including the emperor among Japanese leaders prosecuted for war crimes. One lengthy report to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> describes the <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> as changing his customary practice of acquiescing in all decisions of others to put the brakes on a futile war effort that was out of control. After the collapse of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> it was obvious to Japanese leaders that the war was lost but `` the force of militarism and the momentum which was carrying the war along were like a bicycle rolling down hill without brakes: there was no way to stop it and the army itself did not know how to give up,'' said the November, 1945, account of the Japanese version of events leading to surrender. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, a political adviser to Gen. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON>, the supreme allied commander, wrote the report quoting a long conversation with <PERSON> Hisatsune </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakomizu </PERSON>, who was chief cabinet secretary under <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s last wartime Prime Minister, <PERSON> Kantoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, an admiral, had been <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s aide-de-camp for six years and had a personal friendship with the emperor, unlike the earlier Prime Minister, Gen. <PERSON> Hideki </PERSON> <PERSON> Tojo </PERSON>, who was later convicted of war crimes and hanged. Thus <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> for the first time `` was able to express his true feelings through the prime minister,'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Sakomizu </PERSON> as saying. On August 9, the day <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> was bombed in history's second atomic attack, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> decided that nuclear weapons and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s entry into the war provided needed justification for ending the conflict. `` The emperor agreed that the war should be brought to an end on the basis of the -LRB- allied -RRB- <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION> declaration,'' the account said. It continued: Six top leaders discussed accepting <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION> and deadlocked. Prime Minister <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, the navy and foreign ministers favored acceptance provided only that the emperor was retained. The war minister and the army and navy chiefs of staffs insisted on two other conditions -- that allied forces not occupy <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> be allowed to bring home its forces without surrendering them abroad. Unable to get the customary consensus, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> went to the emperor, who called an <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> at 11 p.m. Deadlock continued, with the prime minister supported 4-3. `` Always before it had been the custom for a conference to reach a decision without directly involving the emperor,'' but because of the close division <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> asked him to decide, said the report. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sakomizu </PERSON> quoted the mikado as speaking out for peace and giving his reasons: `` 1. From the very start of the war, the plans and information of the military had been far removed from the facts of the true situation; `` 2. That to continue the war would mean the destruction of the Japanese people and the country and would also be disastrous to world civilization. and ... `` 3. Termination of the war in this manner at this time was in accordance with the will of God and the destiny of the world.'' Early Aug. 10, the imperial government messaged acceptance of <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION> with the understanding that the emperor would be retained. A reply three days later said the ultimate form of government would depend on the freely expressed will of the Japanese people. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> favored immediate final acceptance but most of the military again `` unalterabily opposed.'' <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> on his own initiative called another <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> for Aug. 14 at which he asked all to accept his decision to issue an imperial rescript ending the war. It was readied at 11 p.m. and the emperor decided on his historic broadcast directly to the people. <PERSON> Sakomizu </PERSON> also gave details of already-known unsuccessful moves by diehard army officers to prevent the broadcast by sealing off the palace during the night of August 15, attacking the prime minister's official residence and burning the homes of <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiranuma </PERSON>, the privy council president who had favored peace On August 16 the stunned populace for the first time heard <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s voice declare that the war `` has developed not necessarily to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s advantage,'' and was over.

 A tip prompted by a television show led to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> arrest of a fugitive charged with poisoning his wife eight years ago in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, officials report. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 44, was apprehended without incident by authorities Friday on the island of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday. An unidentified tipster who saw <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Unsolved Mysteries'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Dec. 28 contacted police Tuesday, said Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. The show was aired the next evening in <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is accused of killing his wife, <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, in 1980 with a fatal injection on the couple's farm in <LOCATION> Wright </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hillsdale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, about 100 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. At the time, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> told police that his wife fell off a horse, hit her head and died. Medical examiners, however, found in her body traces of a muscle relaxant that is nearly impossible to detect. They also found <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had taken out several insurance policies worth a total of $ 250,000 just before his wife's death. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, home that he had n't lost hope that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> would be apprehended some day. `` We've never, ever given up hope. We just figured one day he would make a mistake,'' said <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was arrested at the airport in <LOCATION> Pago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pago </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION> capital and business center of the territory, about 2,300 miles south of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. In addition to the first-degree murder charge in <LOCATION> Hillsdale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, he was charged with federal flight to avoid prosecution. Authorities said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was a pilot for several island airlines. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Frymire </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' arrest was uneventful. `` He at first denied his identity,'' <PERSON> Frymire </PERSON> said. `` By a stroke of luck, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> did n't see the show.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was using the name <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Myer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said. He added it was uncertain how long it would take before <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was returned to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> could waive extradition. <PERSON> Frymire </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who had taken a new identity and had remarried, lived in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION> for the past four years. `` He was n't your typical fugitive,'' he said. `` Apparently, he had posed as a doctor, nurse and even as a harpsichord player.'' <PERSON> Frymire </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was expected to be brought to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> on Sunday. He said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> probably would be arraigned before a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate on Monday. American <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION> is the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory south of the equator. An estimated 38,000 people live in its seven islands. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was last seen in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, on Dec. 24, 1981.

 Feuding Shiite Moslem militias battled with mortars and machine guns in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s violence-scarred streets and the hills of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> today despite a call by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s president to end the weeklong fighting Four people were killed and 12 wounded in battles between the Syrian-backed Amal militia and the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, police said. Syrian troops intervened in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to impose a precarious cease-fire in the capital. A police spokesman said three combatants were killed and eight wounded in the fierce street battles that spilled into the battered commercial district of Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations, said a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighter was killed and four people wounded in artillery and mortar exchanges in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. By police count, 33 people have been killed and 92 wounded since the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> clashes flared Dec. 31. Hundreds of people have been killed or wounded in nine months of intermittent fighting between the two factions, who are battling for dominance of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1 million Shiites, the country's largest sect. President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> appealed Friday to both factions to end the bloodshed. `` Vengeance will not solve anything in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> as saying in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The dispatch was monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The thud of exploding shells and the crackle of automatic weapons fire echoed across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> during the night as <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militiamen staged hit-and-run attacks against <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> positions near the western edge of the Green Line that divides <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> into Moslem and Christian sectors. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> responded by firing mortars into Amal-controlled districts of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to ease the pressure on its fighters, the police spokesman said. Syrian troops armed with AK-47 assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades moved into the contested sector before dawn to enforce a cease-fire, he reported. The clashes were the heaviest fighting between the Shiite factions in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> since Nov. 27, when the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> imposed a cease-fire after six days of violence in which 40 people were killed and 87 wounded. In south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> gunners fired howitzers at <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters in the villages of <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jarjou </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleem </PERSON>, <PERSON> Louwaizeh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouswar </PERSON> on the northwestern edge of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed `` security zone,'' which runs along <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s southern border. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fired mortars into Amal supply lines. `` No change of positions was reported in the region,'' the police spokesman said, who noted that the southern fighting died down early today. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, is made up of <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> fundamentalists loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. The more secular Amal, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main surrogate in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, rejects <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s religious influence over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Shiites.

<TEXT>
 A senior member of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-style ruling party said today that deposed King <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> could play a role in ending the Afghan war but President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> would not resign <PERSON> Najmuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawyani </PERSON>, one of 14 Politburo members of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>, accused anti-government guerrillas of blocking efforts to form a broad-based government Leaders of the Afghan Moslem resistance, who have been meeting this week in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> with the Soviet first deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, vehemently reject the participation of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and his party in any future government. `` <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> will not resign, and we have not heard any such thing from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kawyani </PERSON> told a news conference at the Afghan Embassy in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> told Western journalists in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> last month he was willing to do anything to bring peace to his country as Soviet forces withdraw, but he avoided saying whether that included resigning. <PERSON> Kawyani </PERSON>, who comes from <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s own Parchami faction of the party, said: `` I must emphasize that without the participation of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>, peace is impossible.'' Asked about <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, the deposed monarch whom <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> last month, <PERSON> Kawyani </PERSON> said: `` The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> is of the view that the ex-king, <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, can play a role in a political settlement of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. ... We're waiting for him to express a point of view. We're interested in a settlement. The return of <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> does not mean a return of the monarchy.'' <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> was overthrown in 1973 by his cousin, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>, who was killed five years later in the coup that installed the Soviet-backed government. In 1979, Soviet troops intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to help defend the government from Moslem guerrilla attacks. In the last few years, the party has sought to distance itself publicly from its Marxist beginnings, but the Moslem resistance movement, composed of seven Pakistan-based parties and eight Iran-based parties, routinely refers to the party as `` godless communists.'' <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> is increasingly mentioned as the only Afghan leader with sufficient stature to serve as even a symbolic leader. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> met resistance leaders in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> on Dec. 3, giving the guerrillas the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s first public recognition as a negotiating force for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s future. The guerrillas have been fighting <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s government since the 1978 coup. With arms supplied by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and several Arab nations, the guerrillas also attacked Soviet forces that numbered 115,000 a year ago. The Soviets started withdrawing troops last May under a U.N.-sponsored accord signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The remaining 50,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers are scheduled to leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15 under the accord. <PERSON> Kawyani </PERSON>, in his late 30s with a black mustache reminiscent of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of violating the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Accord by continuing to arm the guerrillas. He demanded <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> stop providing shelter for the guerrillas. The seven mujahedeen parties based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> openly maintain offices in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, 20 miles from the Afghan border. `` A council of peace should be formed from all the involved parties,'' <PERSON> Kawyani </PERSON> said. `` Another option is an international conference under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.''

<TEXT>
 The grandson of Soviet revolutionary leader <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>, back from his first visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in a half-century, said the Soviet attitude toward his grandfather is full of contradictions. However, <PERSON> Esteban </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronstein </PERSON> said the fact that he was granted a visa indicated a slight improvement in his grandfather's status <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON> said Friday that he spent five days in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last month visiting <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakharonavna </PERSON>, his half-sister and <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>'s granddaughter `` She's very gravely ill with cancer,'' said <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON>. Nevertheless, he said, they had a happy reunion. <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON> said he hadn ` t seen his sister since he fled the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with his mother in 1931, when he was 5 years old. <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON> was living with <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> when the former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was assassinated on <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s orders on Aug. 20, 1940. <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>, born <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronstein </PERSON>, was one of the leaders of the October 1917 revolution that established the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but he lost a power struggle with <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and was exiled in 1929. Under Stalinism, <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> was deemed a non-person, reviled in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. It was only recently that <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>'s reputation began to be revived as <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost gathered steam. <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>'s name is now sometimes mentioned in public and he is described as an enemy of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> rather than an enemy of socialism and the revolution. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rehabilitated a son, <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON>'s uncle <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedov </PERSON>, who was executed on <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s orders in 1937 The court ordered all charges against <PERSON> Sedov </PERSON> dropped. <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON> said he traveled to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> shortly after the earthquake last month that devastated <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, killing about 55,000 people. `` We had trouble getting seats, there were so many people flying to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to help,'' said <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON>. He said in addition to visiting his sister, he met with about 500 members of a group formed in Trotksy's memory. He said he was also interviewed on videotape by <PERSON> Ogonyonk </PERSON>, the magazine on the leading edge of glasnost. `` I do n't know if they'll broadcast the videotape,'' he said. `` I think it was for use sometime in the future.'' <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON>, a retired chemical engineer, believes his grandfather's role in the founding of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should not be distorted or hidden <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON> also said he left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at such a young age that he remembers almost nothing. He now considers himself a Mexican and said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was extremely cold. `` It was all snow,'' <PERSON> Volkow </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will bury Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> after weeks of ceremonies that will follow closely the rituals and pageantry of his father's funeral 62 years ago. The formal state funeral is planned for Feb. 24, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> news service reported, quoting government sources. There was no immediate government announcement. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> died today from intestinal cancer. He was 87. Ceremonies to purify the mausoleum where <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s body will lay, to enshrine his spirit and to mark the departure of the imperial hearse from the palace for the burial site are among 29 funeral rites planned. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> will head a committee to decide funeral details. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s father, <ORGANIZATION> Emperor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taisho </ORGANIZATION>, was buried 45 days after his death on Dec. 25, 1926, in an elaborate garden ceremony that included a funeral march of 6,000 people. `` Although there have been many changes since then, including major changes in the constitution, in practical terms there wo n't be many alterations in the funeral rites,'' a palace official said before <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death. That would mean there could be more than 61 different ceremonies, rites and imperial court appearances extending over at least two years before his son <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>'s formal ascension to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 2,600-year-old Chrysanthemum Throne Many are directly linked to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s native Shinto religion, for which the emperor serves as chief priest. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was considered a living Shinto god until allied occupation authorities forced him to renounce his divinity after World War II. The postwar constitution makes the emperor the `` symbol of state.'' Officials say <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s body will be placed in a casket two or three days after his death. The funeral, on a day that will be declared a national holiday, will include a procession of top officials and foreign dignitaries to a royal burial ground. In a departure from common Japanese practice, palace officials said the emperor will not be cremated. Government officials avoided talking about the funeral before <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death, believing it inappropriate while he was still battling his illness. The 45-day period after <ORGANIZATION> Taisho </ORGANIZATION>'s death was likely related to the time required for foreign dignitaries to travel to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, since only boat transportation was available at the time, the palace official said.

<TEXT>
 In <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where one-quarter of the population is of <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> descent, Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was remembered as a symbol of unity who helped <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> emerge as a leading democracy in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, who reigned for 62 years, died today of intestinal cancer at age 87. His eldest son, Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, 55, immediately became the 125th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne. Elsewhere Friday, Americans made books of condolence in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> as officials planned to mark his passing in ceremonies during the coming days. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> offered condolences and lauded <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> for playing `` a truly heroic role'' in urging his country to surrender after the atomic bombing of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the close of World War II. Mourning was most evident at the Japanese consulate in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> had planted a tree during a 1975 visit to the Islands. The Japanese flag flew at half-staff and officials monitored Japanese radio accounts of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death. Consul General <PERSON> Tadayuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nonoyama </PERSON> invited mourners to the consulate on Monday and Tuesday to sign a book of condolences for the royal family. <PERSON> Nonoyama </PERSON> said his own loss was made greater because he had known <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, once serving as an interpreter in the royal household. `` I have a deep affection for the emperor. He was a very sincere man,'' <PERSON> Nonoyama </PERSON> said. Sen. Spark <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, said he had great respect for <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, with whom he met on several occasions. `` The emperor's role as a symbol of unity contributed to the miracle performed by the Japanese people in developing their country as the leading democratic nation in post-war <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, politically, economically and culturally,'' <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fasi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> `` will long be remembered as the god who became a man, and through his personal humility brought respect and dignity out of the tragedy of war.'' In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, plans to mark <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s passing would be formalized next week, said <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the State of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s Japanese consulate also would have a book of condolences for signing, she said. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, Japanese-Americans voiced restrained sympathy over the monarch's passing. `` I suspect that in a way the Japanese-Americans who are living in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> may take the death a little more seriously, or hard,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Duus </PERSON>, professor of modern Japanese history at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` When the older generation left <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> the emperor was almost like a Russian Czar, surrounded by religious awe. And the younger generation here, as a result, have a wonderful time-capsule picture of the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> their parents knew,'' <PERSON> Duus </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimura </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> chapter, said, `` This is a shock even though we knew he was sick. `` Even though we are Japanese-Americans there is still some strong feelings for our homeland,'' <PERSON> Kimura </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, Japanese residents planned a ceremony Monday to memorialize the emperor, but the state's <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> community planned no commemoration to avoid misunderstanding over <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s wartime role. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozaki </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION>, said the organization made arrangements for a `` kicho,'' or memorial ceremony for the state's 7,000 Japanese to bow before a portrait of the emperor and sign a condolence book on Monday at <LOCATION> Sakura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, a Japanese commercial area in downtown <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Fingerprint On Salad Dressing Jar Convicts 320-Pound Burglar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHESAPEAKE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 320-pound man whose appetite got the best of him while he was burglarizing a home fixed himself a meal _ and one to go _ but was caught when authorities found his fingerprint on a salad-dressing jar. `` This man is no overweight Goldilocks sampling their porridge ... He's a brazen thief,'' Deputy <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Givando-Cline </PERSON> said Friday at the trial of <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. White. `` We have a man apparently overcome by the vigor of his own appetite who stops during the course of his own burglary and prepares himself a feast,'' <PERSON> Givando-Cline </PERSON> said. White, 24, of <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION>, was convicted of burglary, fined $ 1,000 and sentenced to 5 -LCB- years in prison. <PERSON> Givando-Cline </PERSON> said <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who is 6-foot-2, entered a townhouse through an unlocked door on the night of June 4, 1986, while the family of four slept upstairs. The prosecutor said <PERSON> White </PERSON> took a videocassette recorder, tapes and $ 69. But White did n't leave after getting the loot, opting instead to plunder the pantry, <PERSON> Givando-Cline </PERSON> said. Littering the counters were a plate that previously held four salmon cutlets, an open loaf of bread, orange peels and pitchers of milk, water and Kool-Aid. The burglar also packed a snack to go of luncheon meats, cheese, oranges, ice cream and Kool-Aid, the prosecutor said. <PERSON> Givando-Cline </PERSON> said <PERSON> White </PERSON>'s fingerprint was found on a jar of Miracle Whip Light salad dressing in the kitchen. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> White </PERSON>'s court-appointed attorney, argued that fingerprint evidence is not steadfast. `` For 20 years fingerprints can stay there,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` Think about that the next time you're in a grocery store and touch a jar of mayonnaise there.''

<HEAD>Tremor Jolts Swiss Alps, No Major Damage Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pre-dawn earthquake jolted the Swiss Alps today, but no major damage was reported, authorities said. <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s strongest tremor in five years, which measured 3.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, was felt mainly in the region around the <LOCATION> Valais </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION> ski resort of <LOCATION> Crans-Montana </LOCATION>, the Swiss <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> reported. Tremors were felt up to 30 miles from the quake's epicenter, said the institute's chief earthquake specialist <PERSON> Dieter-Mayer </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON>. He said one resident called authorities to report a crack in a house wall. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. An earthquake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans, while a quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage in populated areas. A tremor of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.

 Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> made a surprise appearance today at a hotel filled with foreign journalists and vowed that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> would not yield to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure for a million years. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s unannounced arrival at <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>'s top hotel was his first public appearance since <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jetfighters on Wednesday shot down two Libyan Soviet-built MiGs over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. According to sources in the capital, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> had not been seen in public for several weeks, a period of sharply increased tensions between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations the Libyans had constructed a chemical weapons factory in the desert 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has insisted the plant will manufacture medicine. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said he could not rule out a military strike against the site, at <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>. His recent disappearance from view had prompted speculation that, fearing a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack, he had fled the capital, possibly going to a refuge in the desert. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s fortified headquarters in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, which include a residence of the leader, was bombed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in April 1986 to retaliate for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s alleged support of terrorism. About 200 reporters mobbed <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, who was ringed by bodyguards when he appeared in one of the hotel's lobby lounges. Speaking softly for about five minutes, he gave a statement in Arabic, whose translation was not immediately available. Then he answered some of the journalists' shouted questions. A man from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s official news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> translated some of his replies, in Arabic, into English. `` <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is opposing the use of chemical weapons,'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said in his only comment on issue in the question-and-answer period. Asked how he felt, he said only, `` I'm fine.'' His curly hair was topped by a black, wool pillbox hat. He wore a maroon-and-blue sweater, covered by a brown wool cape, to protect him against <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>'s rainy weather. Asked about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressures on his country, he vowed never to bow to the Americans, `` even if this confrontation lasts 1 million years.'' The unexpected sight of a smiling <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> in the hotel set off chaos. Journalists and camera crews knocked over potted plants, scrambled atop chairs and climbed over a two-story-high ornamental fountain inside the lobby. The Libyan government, challenging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> justifications for the downing of two <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> jets, has claimed its planes were overwhelmed by 14 `` hostile American aircraft.'' A government spokesman said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assertion that two American jets had acted in self-defense after being dogged in the air by the Libyan MiG-23s was `` a fabrication.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has provided television stations with videotape said to be from Wednesday's attack, as taken by one of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft, and has shown blurred photographs to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of what it said was a Libyan plane carrying four bombs that was downed in the encounter. The council met in emergency session Thursday and Friday to consider <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s request for a condemnation of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> act. The council is to resume its session Monday morning. Libyan <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoys have contended the planes were unarmed and on a simple reconnaissance mission. In other developments: _ At least two MiG-23 jet fighters sat at <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>'s airport Friday, poised to enter the takeoff runway A day earlier, no military planes were seen on any runway. Increased security was noted at the headquarters of <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. _ A <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> said he believed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> had had `` contacts'' through a third country to defuse the tension _ Reports circulated that <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> had ousted his military chief, but the reports could not be confirmed <PERSON> Rajab </PERSON> <PERSON> Abou </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabbous </PERSON>, secretary of the information ministry, told a news conference Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> jets launched a premeditated attack. He disputed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s account that the two planes, which were attached to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s 6th Fleet, were threatened by the Libyan MiGs. `` The truth is that 14 _ count them _ attacked two Libyan planes on a normal reconnaissance flight,'' said <PERSON> Dabbous </PERSON>. `` The -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- statements of the last couple of weeks show a pattern of premeditation,'' he added. `` It is not by chance the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- fleet was off our coast.'' Tensions between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> have been high over <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s charges that <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> is on the verge of full chemical weapons production. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has threatened to bomb the plant it says is involved. In a special program Friday night, official Libyan television said: `` While -LRB- the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> jets were -RRB- carrying out their duties, seven groups of hostile American aircraft suddenly appeared at 1100 hours.'' It said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes flew away, but one pair `` suddenly reappeared and fired at our aircraft while they were in their regular flight.'' The television program and <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> said the issue was not whether the Libyan planes were carrying missiles, but one of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` premeditated aggression.''

 Troops backed by helicopter gunships today stormed a military garrison held by Moslem gunmen and ended a three-day standoff in which at least 17 people were reported killed. Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON>, military chief of staff, said the camp _ captured Thursday by eight Moslem policemen and seven supporters who took two high-ranking officers hostage _ was secured late this afternoon. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said eight soldiers and two civilians were wounded. He said 16 bodies, many burned beyond recognition, were found in the headquarters building and the camp mosque. One of the rebel supporters was killed and his wife was wounded in Thursday's takeover The military attacked the Moslems on Friday after the captives _ Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Batalla </PERSON> and Col. <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Abendan </PERSON> _ were reported killed. After that attack was repulsed, the military tried again today. The military confirmed that <PERSON> Batalla </PERSON> was killed during the standoff and said one of the 16 bodies recovered was tentatively identified as <PERSON> Abendan </PERSON>. The policemen had been ordered to surrender to <LOCATION> Batalla </LOCATION>, the regional Philippine Constabulary commander, to face murder charges in a 1984 incident. The military said up to 60 other Moslems, including many soldiers, had joined the rebel group after ransacking the garrison armory. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said she was `` grieved'' by the loss of lives but added: `` Let there be no doubt about our equally strong resolve to protect our people from such brutal and senseless acts of violence.'' At midmorning, two military UH-1 helicopters strafed the main stronghold with machine gun fire and a Sikorsky helicopter fired four rockets, setting the building on fire. Government troops surrounding the compound cheered as the helicopters opened fire. The compound is in <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION>, 560 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The leader of the gunmen, patrolman <PERSON> Rizah </PERSON> <PERSON> Alih </PERSON>, was charged but acquitted in the November 1984 slaying of Mayor <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON>. Three weeks after <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON>'s death, seven people were killed in a marine raid on <PERSON> Alih </PERSON>'s home. <PERSON> Alih </PERSON> faces murder charges in those deaths. Last month, <PERSON> Batalla </PERSON> received permission to arrest Alih. <PERSON> Batalla </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Alih </PERSON> and eight others detained. All of them could be charged with murder or conspiracy to commit murder. In an apparently unrelated incident, military sources said seven marines were killed and two wounded today during an attack by Moslem rebels on <LOCATION> Basilan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> island </LOCATION>, about 10 miles to the south. A military report said two rebels were also slain. About 5 million Moslems live in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, which has population of 59 million.

 Attorneys representing the estate of <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> portrayed a companion of the actor who died of AIDS as an opportunist who threatened to go public with the love letters <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had written him. But a lawyer for <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said his client was victimized by the actor who died in October 1985 because <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> concealed knowledge of his incurable and contagious disease. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s secretary, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, hid <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s disease from <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> until the whole world heard about it, attorney <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> told jurors Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 11 million lawsuit. `` <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> got a call from <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>. `` He said, ` I'm sorry. The movie star told me not to tell you, I know it's not fair. But I was only following orders.''' <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said the trial would focus on whether <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had a duty to warn his sexual partner that he had AIDS and whether Christian should be compensated for emotional distress and the `` enhanced fear'' that he, too, had been infected. The estate's attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> has not developed AIDS, which supports his theory that the affair ended shortly after it began. `` If he does n't have AIDS what motivation is there for suing?'' he asked. `` And if it was n't a movie star of <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s stature would he be suing?'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> had vowed to keep <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s illness secret from everyone, including <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>. `` This was a man <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> trusted closer than he would trust a brother,'' he said. `` When <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> learned he had AIDS, he turned to this friend he trusted with this terrible secret because it would be safe.'' But he said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> did not believe that <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> was continuing to have sex with <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> told <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> they were not having sex, that they had n't had sex since February 1984,'' <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> said. He also quoted <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>: `` Give the kid what he wants. He has letters.'' Banks said <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> lived off <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> as he lived off a woman 33 years his senior with whom he had an affair. `` What the evidence is going to show,'' said Banks, `` is he -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is interested in the will, money and publicity. `` When the <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> gravy train ended and Mr. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> died, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> filed this suit because the will had been probated and he was n't in it,'' he said. Attorneys for <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> estate contend the love affair between <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> soured in early 1984 because <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> told <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> he had sold sex for money. They said <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> stopped having sex with <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> and allowed him to stay in his home for the next 18 months only because <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> threatened to expose the star's homosexuality. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> deluded his lover by hiding his disease and was protected by <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who told <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had anorexia, not AIDS. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> described a tender 2 -LCB- - year love affair that began when <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> met at a political fund-raiser in October 1982 <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> was 28, and <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, 56. In early 1983, `` <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said he was falling in love with <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> and that he had n't felt this way since he was in high school,'' <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. The men engaged in sex three to five times a week with neither man using a condom, <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> developed symptoms of AIDS a year later, including rashes and sores, profuse sweating and rapid weight loss. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> was diagnosed with AIDS in June 1984, but decided not to tell Christian, <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Azerbaijani Refugee Count Reaches 160,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of Azerbaijanis who fled neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to their homeland in the face of ethnic unrest and a devastating earthquake has swelled to 160,000, an <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> official said today. Thousands of the refugees are camping in schools, clubs and other public buildings as they await resettlement, said <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bagirov </PERSON>, who did not give his first name. Others have been placed in new jobs and housing all over the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, he said, although officials are still trying to persuade both Azerbaijani and Armenian refugees to return home. The refugee situation in neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> is much worse, since the 90,000 Armenians who fled <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> have been joined by half a million left homeless by the devastating Dec. 7 earthquake. Previous figures refugees, issued in November, said about 75,000 Armenians and 75,000 Azerbaijanis had fled to their homelands. Ethnic violence between the Moslem Azerbaijanis and the Christian Armenians has torn the two southern Soviet republics for the past year, and the latest outbreak starting in November killed 43 people, according to today's Pravda. <PERSON> Bagirov </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> capital, was calm. The atmosphere in the city was described as `` explosive'' during ethnic unrest just before the quake. However, chief investigator Gen. Lt. V.K. <PERSON> Pankin </PERSON> of the national <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> told Pravda today, `` The situation is still complicated.'' His department has sent staffers from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to assist <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> law enforcement personnel to ensure correct investigation of crimes, he told Pravda. Several Armenian prosecutors were fired this week for failing to fulfill their duties. Authorities have begun filing criminal charges against those who committed acts of violence during the riots, including murder and arson, <PERSON> Pankin </PERSON> said.

In <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, authorities continue to detain 100 to 200 people a night for curfew violations, <PERSON> Bagirov </PERSON> said. On Friday, for example, 104 people were held for violating the curfew and four were detained for inciting ethnic dissension where a curfew has been imposed. About 15,000 Armenians have returned to <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> after fleeing at the height of the violence and daily demostrations by Azerbaijani nationalists, <PERSON> Bagirov </PERSON> said.

 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, once venerated as a living god and made into the guiding spirit of a world war, today died of intestinal cancer, ending a 62-year reign that saw his nation recover from ruin to riches. He was 87. Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, oldest of the emperor's two sons, became the 125th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne. In a solemn, wordless four-minute ceremony, a sword, jewels and the imperial seals were placed on a table in front of him, and he bowed. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> died without ever having shed much light on his World War II role. Historians generally agree he was a figurehead who was required to approve decisions of the military leaders, until he decided the Japanese had suffered enough _ atomic bombing, firebombing and invasion _ and personally announced surrender in August 1945. His death followed a 3 -LCB- - month illness during which reports on his blood pressure and temperature became fixtures of Japanese routine and many festivities were postponed or canceled The government proclaimed a six-day formal mourning period and named the new emperor's reign Heisei, or Achieving Peace. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s reign, which began on Dec. 25, 1926, was called Showa, or Enlightened Peace Thousands of people signed condolence registers at the palace. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s stock markets closed, but banks and many shops remained open. Some clerks wore black ribbons to signify mourning but, prepared by the monarch's long illness, people generally reacted calmly. In western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, however, an 87-year-old man hanged himself today, leaving a note that said in part, `` I want to follow the emperor in death,'' police said. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Umanosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ue </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldier, had been particularly proud of having been born in the same year as the emperor. In western <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, police arrested 10 members of the radical leftist Chukakuha -LRB- Middle Core Faction -RRB- on charges of assembling weapons for a demonstration against the nation's monarchy. About 100 faction members tried to demonstrate, and `` some of those arrested tried to push through with bamboo rods against riot police,'' said a police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said 15,000 riot police were being mobilized around <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> against possible sabotage. About 90 people peacefully marched in another <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> district with banners bearing such slogans as `` No more emperor'' and suggesting <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> bore responsibility for the war. `` I could not stand the thought that people outside <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are going to think ... everyone is crying over his death,'' said organizer <PERSON> Ryuichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Harada </PERSON>. `` It is about time we should learn that the image of him being a pacifist and warm and kind old man was forced on us.'' The formal state funeral is planned for Feb. 24, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> news service reported, quoting government sources. There was no immediate government announcement. Until <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death, palace officials refused to acknowledge that the emperor was suffering from cancer. Japanese rarely inform cancer patients of their disease. After fell seriously ill on Sept. 19, 67.8 pints of blood transfusions helped keep <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> alive. In September 1987, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> had undergone intestinal bypass surgery, but doctors had said that a growth found there was not cancerous. `` With heartfelt sorrow, I, together with our people, wish to express my deep sense of loss on the passing,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said in a television address. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> recounted <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s `` eventful and turbulent'' reign, through the Depression and `` the calamities of that deplorable war'' to unprecedented postwar economic growth. `` He resolutely brought to an end the war that had broken out in spite of his wishes, out of a determination to prevent further suffering of the people,'' said <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> joined leaders worldwide in offering condolences. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lauded <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> for playing `` a truly heroic role'' in urging his country to surrender. Reaction to his death, however, was muted in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, ruled harshly as a colony during 20 years of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s rule, and by some Chinese who held <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> accountable for the Japanese invasion of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in World War II. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> died in the moat-ringed palace where he had stayed most of the time, a remote figure who was known, however, as an eminent marine biologist and avid fan of sumo, a traditional Japanese form of wrestling. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> wrote 12 books on hydrozoans, small sea animals. The world's oldest imperial line _ held by the same family since at least the 8th century and by legend since 660 B.C. _ passed automatically to <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>. If tradition is followed, there will be more than 60 different ceremonies over the next two years until <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> is formally enthroned. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, 55, was schooled among commoners and, in an upset to precedent, married a commoner. With Princess <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> becoming the new empress, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Nagako </PERSON>, 85, becomes empress dowager. The new crown prince, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>'s eldest son <PERSON> Naruhito </PERSON>, 28, formerly known as Prince <PERSON> Hiro </PERSON>, also is a tennis player, and studied at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> has indicated he would lower some of the walls around the monarchy, and he once reportedly told a friend, `` I want to shake up the imperial protocol system.''

 Stores covered display windows with white cloth, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> turned its music down and the stock market closed today in a show of commercial restraint as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> mourned the death of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. And in western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an 87-year-old man hanged himself today, leaving a note that said in part, `` I want to follow the emperor in death.'' But while shock and a flurry of cancellations followed the sudden worsening of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s health in September, his long illness had given Japanese time to prepare for the end of his 62-year era. The government declared an official six-day mourning period, and the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> called on schools and athletic organizations `` to unite together to suitably mourn the emperor.'' Thousands of people lined up at the Imperial Palace to pray and sign their names on registries to express condolences for <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, 87, who died today of intestinal cancer. `` Of course it's a shock. I had hoped that the emperor would live as long as possible,'' said <PERSON> Masakichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Koizumi </PERSON>, 69, one of those in line. `` But it was inevitable.'' In downtown <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, a group of about 90 people marched for about an hour protesting the imperial system of rule. Television newscasters changed into dark clothing to express mourning. Although stock exchanges canceled their regular half-day sessions, banks, department stores and chain stores remained open. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> was open, but played its music at half the normal volume. Most stores in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s normally garish <LOCATION> Ginza </LOCATION> shopping district turned off their electric signs and erected Japanese rising-sun flags topped with black streamers. At a <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant, clerks with black ribbons pinned to their lapels scurried to serve customers. Department stores covered their elaborate show windows with white sheets. `` We thought it would be better, given the circumstances, to cover up the decorative displays,'' said <PERSON> Haruhisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattori </PERSON>, director of advertising at <ORGANIZATION> Wako </ORGANIZATION> department store. But not everyone supported the expressions of `` jishuku,'' or self-restraint. `` I think it's crazy to do things like that for someone who shared responsibility for World War II,'' said a 33-year-old office worker, pointing to the covered Wako window. `` I had hoped the emperor would apologize -LRB- for the war -RRB- before he died.'' Questions over <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s wartime role _ whether he was an active participant in planning the hostilities, or merely used by militarists _ remain controversial in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, although most people express affection for the dead monarch and say they favor the emperor system. The anti-imperial protest went on for about an hour in downtown <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` I could not stand the thought that people outside <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are going to think all Japanese are emperor lovers and everyone is crying over his death,'' said organizer <PERSON> Ryuichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Harada </PERSON>. Passers-by looked uncomfortably at the marchers. `` I do n't believe it,'' one said `` Are they really Japanese?'' All major political parties expressed sorrow over the emperor's death, with the exception of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which officially opposes the imperial system <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition group, said the emperor's reign `` was full of bitter experiences and shocks,'' and pledged her party would work to use the lessons of history to achieve a permanent peace. `` The sad news of the passing of his late majesty the emperor has left me grief-stricken,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said. `` Our sincere prayers for his recovery were in vain, and I am at a loss for words.'' <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s fifth daughter, <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimazu </PERSON>, said her father had `` battled gallantly'' against his cancer. `` I hope he now will be able to rest peacefully,'' she said. `` He was n't a god, but he was somehow different from ordinary people,'' said <PERSON> Hiroko </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotoh </PERSON>, 22. `` I do n't think I've changed inside because of his death, but I have a feeling an era has changed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.''

 Sikh militants shot and killed 10 Hindus and set fire to a railway station to avenge the hanging of two Sikhs for the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, officials said today. Three or four Sikhs carrying AK-47 rifles raided four homes of Hindu workers in <LOCATION> Badowal </LOCATION> village in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> on Friday, police chief <PERSON> Govind </PERSON> <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> said. `` They separated the male members from others and shot them from point-blank range,'' <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. One woman was injured in the firing when she tried to save her husband, he said. The area is 20 miles south of the Sikh holy city of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. A note left by the killers said this was the first revenge killing for the deaths of <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who were hanged Friday in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> prison after their conviction for assassinating Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. The note threatened more massacres in the state, <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> said. Also in apparent revenge for the hangings, a group of radicals set fire to the <LOCATION> Alab </LOCATION> railway station in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sangrur </LOCATION> district on Friday night, said officials in <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>, the state capital. After also damaging furniture at the station, the attackers fled, said the officials, who demanded anonymity. Sikh militants had threatened widespread massacres of Hindus in retaliation for the executions. Tens of thousands of police and paramilitary troops were deployed across northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to check outbreaks of secterian violence, authorities said. The latest killings brought this week's death toll blamed on the militants in the northern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> to at least 40. Last year, 2,400 people were killed in Sikh violence in the state. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was slain in apparent revenge for the Indian army's June 1984 raid on <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> The raid was to clear the temple of Sikh militants who were entrenched there. About 1,200 people, mainly Sikhs, died in the operation. Sikh militants have fought since 1982 for a separate nation in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s north. They claim discrimination by Hindus, who make up more than 80 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people.

Eight countries now have given embassy status to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The others are <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. They are among about 70 countries that have recognized the independent Palestinian state proclaimed in November by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile. Boundaries of the still-symbolic Palestinian state have not been defined. Official Radio <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said that at King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s direction, `` <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> has decided to consider the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> the embassy of the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> sources said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would lay the embassy's cornerstone in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> today. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman as saying <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s move will strengthen friendly relations between the Chinese and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> long has been a supporter of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and other Arab causes. It says it will not normalize relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> until <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> returns land seized in the 1967 Israel-Arab war. <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Doha </LOCATION> was upgraded because of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> state's desire to `` bolster the national legitimate rights of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people, especially their right to self-determination and establishing their independent state on their national soil.'' Leaders of the 13-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> today called on European countries to upgrade <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> offices there to embassy status. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Thursday elevated the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s representation in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to `` General Delegation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>.'' That fell short of diplomatic recognition but still was considered a significant political response to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s moderate policies. Earlier today, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> met <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> at the government guest house in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> to review `` the challenges facing the Arab community in addition to bilateral relations,'' <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Petra </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s prime minister, <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON>, was present with several <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> executive committee members.

 Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said today <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would `` find a way'' to support <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s communist government after the withdrawal of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> told reporters a broad-based government `` representing all the political forces of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'' is the only way to guarantee peace after the remaining 50,000 Soviet troops depart. The Soviets are to withdraw by Feb. 15. The Soviet envoy dismissed claims by Moslem insurgents, as well as Pakistani and Western analysts, that the ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> will be toppled once Soviet troops leave `` It will survive in its own right and you will know it after the withdrawal of the Soviet forces,'' said <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>. `` We will be supporting them -LRB- <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> communists -RRB- if there is no broad-based government. We will support the regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> as the legal government of the Republic of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` We will find the way,'' said <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>. `` We will tell you later.'' He refused to elaborate further. Afghan guerrillas, who have been fighting the Soviet-backed government for 10 years, have promised to establish a council to choose a transitional government. `` If that's going to be only a one-sided council there is no value in it,'' said <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>. The alliance of seven Afghan guerrilla groups headquartered in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has said no Afghan communists will be allowed to participate in their council. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which is giving refuge to more than 3 million Afghans, also dismissed the participation of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> in a postwar government. However, <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` has all the right to participate as a political force in that broad-based government. `` They must be realistic,'' he said of the guerrillas. `` By puffing and huffing they will not be able to destroy the house of the present regime, if we take the words of the famous fairy tale about the three little pigs.'' <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said the February withdrawal deadline would be met unless the guerrillas attack departing Soviet soldiers. `` It could be delayed if there were all out fighting on Soviet forces, if there were attacks on Soviet forces withdrawing,'' said <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>. `` They will fight back to defend and will not withdraw. `` The Soviet soldiers are not running for their lives,'' he said. The Kremlin sent more than 100,000 Soviet soldiers into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. Last April, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> agreed to withdraw them by Feb. 15. Half had left by August. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> suggested the warring factions should look to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to resolve the deadlock over Afghan's future government. `` They have an important role to play, even more important than ours,'' he said of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>'s diplomatic mission began in early December when he met Pakistan-based guerrillas in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The only significant agreement to come out of that meeting was a decision to hold the <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> talks. The only agreement this time was to hold more talks.

 Market-style economic reforms have brought new prosperity to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but have cost some women their jobs, others their education and have revived traditional views that women should stay at home. In the new atmosphere of competition and making money, the 40-year-old official line that women should share equally in building socialism has been muted. Instead, employers, some local officials and even the influential People's Daily have said openly over the past year what many Chinese believe privately: women are more suited for housework and should be `` liberated'' from outside jobs. Among related developments: _ Many companies forced for the first time to make a profit are refusing to hire women _ both uneducated and college graduates _ saying they ca n't afford maternity benefits Now that factories can fire workers, they are cutting nearly two women for every man, officials say. _ Single teen-age girls in rural areas can still find jobs, however, and many peasant families are pulling them from school to go to work, believing that only sons should be educated More than four-fifths of children not in school are girls, officials say. These trends, which have emerged mainly over the past year, are a startling about-face in a society where nearly 70 percent of women work outside the home. They have generated heated debate in Chinese newspapers and protests from women's groups. `` We advocate that women hold outside jobs,'' said <PERSON> Cai </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheng </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the All-China Woman's <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, an official organization concerned with women's issues. `` This is the first step in liberation. Only then can women achieve political status and economic independence.'' For thousands of years, <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> women's roles were strictly defined by a Confucian code that required obedience first to one's father, then to one's husband Rural women often worked in the fields alongside men, but few were taught to read and write or played any role in the larger society. Many young urban women joined the political ferment that culminated in the Communist victory in 1949. The Communists outlawed the practice of binding women's feet, mandated education of both boys and girls and encouraged women to work in `` building the new <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Cai </PERSON> said traditional views of women's roles remained strong, especially in the countryside. Comments by officials of some rural areas appear to buttress that contention. `` If women do n't stay home, we men ca n't go to work ... with a light heart,'' said <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Fengzhuang </PERSON>, a spokesman for the government of <LOCATION> Daqiuzhuang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Daqiuzhuang </LOCATION>, a community of 3,550 people in the <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Municipal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Region </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, has received favorable publicity from the People's Daily because nearly half the working-age women have become full-time housewives in the decade since <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began its newest economic reforms. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said those reforms have increased prosperity in the village and made two incomes unnecessary. `` By staying home, women can liberate <LOCATION> Daqiuzhuang </LOCATION>'s productivity,'' he said `` What's wrong with people doing what they do best? It's appropriate for women to do -LRB- housework -RRB-. They're more thorough, it's their specialty. Men have strong bodies and can do hard labor.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said most of the housewives were illiterate and therefore made poor outside workers. <LOCATION> Daqiuzhuang </LOCATION> does offer education programs on closed-circuit television. The subjects are cooking and cleaning. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurong </PERSON>, 35, one of <LOCATION> Daqiuzhuang </LOCATION>'s housewives, said she once worked in a factory cafeteria and enjoyed it. But she said she was underpaid, and she now concentrates on caring for her two children, 10 and 14, and for her husband. `` Me go to work?'' she asked. `` A woman ca n't earn enough.'' At the cafeteria she made $ 324 a year. Her husband now earns more than $ 1,620 as a workshop foreman _ more than twice the average worker's salary Although the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said approvingly that <LOCATION> Daqiuzhuang </LOCATION> may `` set the trend for <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> women in the future,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cai </PERSON> said it remains an exception. More widespread, she said, is the problem of employers refusing to hire women or laying off those who are pregnant or have small children. The employers argue they ca n't afford maternity benefits, usually about 70 percent of wages, and that women with children tend to miss work more often and are more tired. The <ORGANIZATION> All-China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> recently cited a survey showing only about 5 percent of company heads favored hiring women. A recent official report said 13,000 women in the northeastern province of <LOCATION> Liaoning </LOCATION> lost their jobs in 1987 because they were pregnant or had just given birth. `` Having children is necessary for society, and we think society should be responsible,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cai </PERSON> said. She supports experiments in several cities that seek to ease the burden on individual enterprises by having government and companies set up a collective fund to pay maternity benefits. Most women would need maternity leave only once because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, trying to control its population, attempts to limit each couple to one child. Resistance to the traditionalist revival is strongest among young, educated women. `` After I marry, I will still struggle to achieve my goals,'' said <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Guanghong </PERSON>, 23, one of <LOCATION> Daqiuzhuang </LOCATION>'s working women. She is in charge of the administrative office of one of <LOCATION> Daqiuzhuang </LOCATION>'s corporations and said her goal is to become company head `` I am a woman of the'80s,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>. `` My mother ... is satisfied being a good wife and mother. But I want to pursue a career and improve myself.'' However, even expressing ambitions is difficult for many <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> women. `` Apart from the sex discrimination by society, sex discrimination also exists in the thinking of women, in their sense of inferiority,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cai </PERSON> said. The key to change, she said, is education, `` but it will take a long time, maybe decades.''

<HEAD>Clamor Rising for Overhaul of Campaign Finance System</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 From lawmakers on Capitol Hill to their reform-minded critics and even well heeled lobbyists, a growing chorus of influential voices is calling for an overhaul of the nation's campaign finance system. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, has campaign finance reform near the top of his agenda for the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as does Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the Republican leader. And change is being urged by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., whose <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> forces used a stubborn filibuster to kill a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> election-money package in the last <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats have no formal agenda yet, but their new majority leader, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, favors change, and the leader of the reform forces, Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., is ready to renew his fight in 1989 There is optimism at Common Cause, the self-described citizens' lobby, which wants to substitute public financing for individual and special interest money in the quarter-billion-dollar plus business of winning seats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` It's going all the way to the top,'' says <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON>, Common Cause president. `` There's a different dynamic now. An awful lot of Republicans are upset with the present system and talking about need for change. There's an unusual opportunity for 1989.'' Joining in the push are some people <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION> wants to send to the election sidelines, for example <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Baer </PERSON>, a senior partner-lobbyist in <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s big league law firms. `` Things have gotten out of hand,'' says <PERSON> Baer </PERSON>, who heads the 150-member Lobbyists and Lawyers for Campaign Finance Reform. <PERSON> Baer </PERSON> says there is deep and growing dissatisfaction over the seemingly endless congressional fundraising events _ sometimes as many as 10 in one night _ at which lobbyists fete candidates with $ 2,000 contributions from political action committees operated by industry, labor and ideological groups. The final tabulations for the 1987-8 election cycle have n't been made by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> says that through last Sept. 30, PAC money continued to grow both in total dollars and in comparison to campaign contributions from individuals. For the period, PACs pumped $ 35.7 million into all <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaigns, up 1.7 percent over the corresponding 21 months of the 1985-6 cycle. They provided more than one-fifth of the $ 159.8 million given to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates. PACs provided one of every three dollars given to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> candidates, or about $ 73.7 million of the $ 214.4 million contributed. The PAC money was nearly 24 percent higher than in the first 21 months of the 1985-6 cycle. As in past years, incumbents fared better than their challengers in the scramble for PAC dollars. Senators got $ 5.17 for every $ 1 contributed to challengers. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> it was 10 to one in favor of incumbents. When the votes were counted, all but six of the 411 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members seeking reelection received another term. Under consideration are spending limits that would slow or halt the rapidly rising cost of campaigns. Provisions could be included involving phone-bank support that labor gives far more readily to Democrats. And lawmakers are puzzling over what to do about huge sums in little-controlled and unreported collected by the national parties. Republicans have opposed altering the system for more than a decade, thinking that they benefit more from the status quo. But Democrats are getting more PAC money. Their fund-raising among individuals is catching up with that of the the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> already has pulled even in the so-called `` soft money'' race to put the bite on corporations and people who can afford a $ 100,000 contribution not covered by <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> limits. And labor continues to favor Democrats. Although <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> is optimistic about action in the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he sees `` a tough battle because individuals who benefit from the current system, incumbents, will be writing the new rules.'' Aides say <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders want to negotiate a bipartisan bill. But House Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., is warning that if necessary Democrats will use their majority to pass their own package The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is a different matter. If they keep their ranks together as they did in the last <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the 45 Republicans can again prevent a vote on campaign legislation they think favors Democrats. `` We can have a bipartisan campaign finance reform bill or we'll have no bill,'' says Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky., <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> spokesman on the `` We can stop it in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or we can stop it in the White House.'' <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> says that `` there's no middle ground on spending limits.'' This puts him in direct conflict with Democrat <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, who last year cosponsored a package calling for voluntary spending limits for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races. Even with this apparent basic difference, <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> says he sees some unspecified `` bargaining room'' with <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> and the Republicans.

<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The ambiguity of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s place in history rests with a key decision made in 1945 by Gen. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON>, who told <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> he would need a million reinforcements to occupy <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> if <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> were prosecuted for war crimes. <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> did not deserve to be prosecuted. But many people then thought the opposite. Even as <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> lay on his deathbed 43 years later, there were some who said he was a war criminal. The debate seems likely to continue as long as the war is remembered. At the end of World War II, the Allies prosecuted Nazi and Japanese war criminals. Seven Japanese government officials, including the prime minister, Gen. <PERSON> Hideki </PERSON> <PERSON> Tojo </PERSON>, were hanged after being found guilty in the main <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> war crimes trial. <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION>, head of the forces occupying <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, wrote in his memoirs, `` Reminiscences,'' that he fended off pressure from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to indict <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. `` Indeed, the initial list of those proposed by them was headed by the emperor's name,'' he wrote. But the general had decided the emperor could play a major role in changing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from a militaristic nation to a peaceful member of the world community. Also, <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> had told <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> a guerrilla war could break out if the emperor were indicted. `` When <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> seemed to be veering toward the British point of view I had advised that I would need at least one million reinforcements should such action be taken,'' <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> wrote. He had n't told the nervously waiting Japanese of his decision, and when the 44-year-old emperor called on <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION>, the general believed <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> might plead for mercy. Instead, <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, his hands trembling, declared: `` I come to you, Gen. <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON>, to offer myself to the judgment of the powers you represent as the one to bear sole responsibility for every political and military decision made and action taken by my people in the conduct of the war.'' <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> accepted a likely death sentence by assuming `` a responsibility clearly belied by facts of which I was fully aware,'' <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> wrote. This provided major evidence of the view held by most historians today: that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> had been a powerless figurehead but had approved orders that led to the attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and put most of East Asia under an often brutal Japanese rule. The main piece of contrary evidence is that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was the one who decided to end the war. If he had that power, and if he thought the war was wrong, why did n't he prevent it? <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was asked at news conferences later to explain, but he gave evasive answers. He said he would n't criticize those who had ruled <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and felt obliged as a constitutional monarch to approve all government decisions. As to having power to end the war, he said the government had told him to decide what to do, so again it was the government's responsibility Analysts of the war crimes trial say a key episode involving Gen. <PERSON> Tojo </PERSON> threatened to bring <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> back into the picture. <PERSON> Tojo </PERSON> testified `` there is no Japanese subject who would go against the will of His Majesty, more particularly, among high officials of the Japanese government.'' Since the American prosecutors had decided to keep <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> out of the trial, they were alarmed at the implication the emperor might bear responsibility. So a week later, the ex-prime minister was led again into the same territory, but this time he had been briefed to give a different impression, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> author <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Minear </PERSON> wrote in his 1971 book `` Victors' Justice.'' <PERSON> Tojo </PERSON> was asked if it was <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s will to institute war. He replied, `` It might have been against his will, but it is a fact that because of my advice and because of advice given by the High Command the emperor consented, though reluctantly, to the war,'' according to <PERSON> Minear </PERSON>'s book. <PERSON> Minear </PERSON> comments: `` The decision to exclude the emperor was a political decision, not a decision based on the facts of the case. Under the concept of conspiracy invoked by the prosecution, it would have been easy to assure the conviction of the emperor on all counts of the indictment.'' The prosecutors' position was that the militarists had deluded the Japanese into thinking the emperor was with them in going to war. <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> summed up his view of the emperor: `` I found he had a more thorough grasp of the democratic concept than almost any Japanese with whom I talked. He played a major role in the spiritual regeneration of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and his loyal cooperation and influence had much to do with the success of the occupation.''

<HEAD>Three Blacks Killed in Natal Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three black men were killed in township violence in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province, police said today, bringing the official death toll from fighting among black political factions this year to 12. One of the three men killed Friday died when police shot into a gang of men who were stoning a township home, police said. More than 1,000 people have died over the past 18 months in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> township fighting, chiefly between members of <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Inkatha </ORGANIZATION>, a Zulu political organization, and supporters of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> Despite national emergency laws and restrictions enforced since June 12, 1986, political unrest has continued at a reduced level, particularly attacks on black policemen and homes of government employees in black townships. But in the first week of 1989, political violence has been reported every day. The events include stabbings and shootings in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION>, mine explosions near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, gasoline bombings of townships houses throughout the country, stonings of houses and cars, and ambushes of policemen. However, the deaths and injuries and the numbers of incidents are much lower than during the height of the unrest from 1984-86. Currently, most incidents occur in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Inkatha </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> are fighting for control of segregated black townships. The front supporters accuse police of siding with <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>, whom they regard as a collaborator because of his position as head of the <ORGANIZATION> KwaZulu </ORGANIZATION> homeland government. <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> accuses the front of supporting the bombing and sabotage campaign of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He disagrees with front policies supporting boycotts, sanctions and strikes to end the apartheid policy of legal race separation. During the violence Friday, police said a group of blacks fired at a another group, killing one man, in <LOCATION> Mpumalanga </LOCATION> township, where a house was damaged by a gasoline bomb. Police said they killed one black man and arrested four men when they opened fire with shotguns and pistols at a crowd of blacks who were stoning a house in <LOCATION> Haza </LOCATION> township. The body of a black man who had been stabbed to death was found at <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s Halt, police said, and another black man was shot and wounded by an unidentified assailant in <LOCATION> Imbali </LOCATION> township.

 Radical Palestinians in the occupied territories have formed a coalition of Moslem fundamentalists and pro-Syrian factions opposed to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s recent peace overtures. The radical alliance on Friday issued a leaflet accusing <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> of `` selling out'' the cause when he recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renounced terrorism. Arab hospital officials said today that a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> village leader in the occupied lands was stabbed to death Friday by unidentified assailants. Elsewhere, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops today shot and wounded 10 Palestinians who attacked them with rocks, an Arab reporter said. Hospital officials said one of the wounded was a 16-year-old girl who was in critical condition after being shot in the head in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Three other <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> were shot and wounded, while six were wounded in the southern <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and hospital officials said on condition of anonymity. The military said it was checking the reports. <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamoudah </PERSON>, the 57-year-old mukhtar or traditional leader of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Qubeiba </LOCATION>, died Friday of multiple stab wounds, said a <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> hospital official. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hamoudah </PERSON> was killed by a Palestinian mob that attacked him at his home because he was suspected of working for Israeli security forces. His two sons, <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> ,22, and <PERSON> Walid </PERSON>, 29, were slightly wounded in the attack, said the hospital official. They were treated for head wounds and discharged. A military spokesman refused to comment on the incident. <LOCATION> Qubeiba </LOCATION> is seven miles northwest of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Palestinians have killed more than a dozen suspected Palestinian collaborators since the anti-Israeli revolt started 13 months ago. They are among at least 347 Arabs and 14 Israelis who have died in the uprising. Last week, death threats against <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> mayor <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> were scrawled on walls in the town after he proposed a truce in the Palestinian uprising. Also last week, a 25-year-old suspected collaborator was killed in <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>. Reports in <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> newspapers say pro-Syrian groups want to install more radical leaders. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, four refugee camps were under curfew today, said an army spokesman who demanded anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in Occupied Palestine, as the radical new coalition calls itself, said in its leaflet, `` We demand the establishment of a militant leadership to replace the diminishing leadership of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>.'' The new faction includes members of <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s Popular Front For the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON>'s breakaway faction of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> group `` There can be no reconciliation with the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> killers and no negotiations with Zionist criminals,'' the document said. `` We oppose any kind of political settlement, whatever its source, and consider negotiation with the enemy to be grave treason and an unforgivable crime.'' It called for a new <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to be led by advocates of armed struggle. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in November implicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in a declaration of an independent Palestinian homeland.

Pro-Syrian Palestinians said the new Palestinian alliance resulted from increased collaboration between extremist factions over the past few months. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has been moving from one mistake to another.

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> today urged the leaders of more than 140 countries to foreswear using chemical weapons and to keep them out of the hands of terrorists. Addressing the first session of an international conference on chemical weapons, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> proposed the imposition of unspecified penalties by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to those violating the 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Protocol banning the use of `` one of humanity's most dreaded and dreadful forms of warfare.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> warned that the threat of terrorists using chemical weapons is `` a real one'' and said some governments linked to terrorism have the ability to produce deadly chemical agents. `` There are no insurmountable technical obstacles that would prevent terrorist groups from using chemical weapons,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told the conference delegates. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did not specify any particular country, but it appeared <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was at least one of his targets when he said, `` Some governments which have been known to sponsor terrorism now have sizable chemical weapons capabilities.'' <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is among the countries on the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s list of nations sponsoring terrorism. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is also on the list, and some analysts fear the country also may have embarked on a chemicals weapon program. `` With the inhibitions against employing such weapons now weakened through recent years _ and with targets for conventional terrorist attacks becoming better protected _ terrorist groups could be tempted to shift without warning to use of chemical weapons for dramatic political and media attention,'' he said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also supported increasing in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general's authority to investigate allegations into the use of chemical arms in war, and said nations must find ways to block the transfer of technology He made no direct reference to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, nor did he single out any other nation believed to possess or have the ability to produce chemical weapons. Only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> acknowledge having such stockpiles. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials maintain chemical weapons are being developed at a plant 60 miles from the Libyan capital. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> denies it. However, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of state said chemical weapons have proliferated in recent years. He cited reports of the use of chemical arms in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` We can not delay. Time is not on our side,'' he said. `` Technology is not stagnant. Ever more lethal and insidious chemical weapons are being developed ... the ability to produce such weapons is rapidly spreading and with it the technology to produce ballistic missiles as delivery vehicles.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said it was, `` grimly ironic'' that the threat of chemical weapons has grown just as progress is being made in controlling and reducing nuclear arms. `` A nightmare for all, of course, would be the combination of ballistic missiles, chemical warheads and biological weapons in the hands of governments with histories of the conduct of terrorist violence.'' In opening the five-day conference today, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> told delegates: `` This conference is not going to be a court of justice. However, you should state unconditionally and unreservedly your condemnation of chemical arms.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> asked for a minute of silence to honor Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, who died today. More than 140 nations were represented _ including 80 by their foreign ministers _ at the meeting at the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The conference is aimed at reaffirming the 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Protocol, banning use of chemical arms, and pressing for a broader agreement that would prohibit their use, production and stockpiling. The emnity between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> loomed over the conference, as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pressed its accusations about Libyan chemical weapons capabilities, trying to persuade industrialized nations the claims are correct. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said Friday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of two Libyan jetfighters `` poisoned'' the atmosphere of the meeting. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes shot down two Libyan planes over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> in self-defense Wednesday. The officials also say the issue of a Libyan chemical plant on the verge of production had nothing to do with the air incident. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> claims its chemical plant, in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, is for making pharmaceuticals. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> agreed today that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and West German experts would meet next week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to weigh any evidence West German firms are involved in the factory in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>. `` We will do everything in our power to prevent German nationals and German companies from taking part in chemical weapons production,'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said. Some published reports have linked a West German firm to the Libyan plant, but the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government has expressed skepticism. For nearly two decades, negotiators in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> have worked without success to draft a new, wider convention to give it some power of enforcement. The meeting in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is meant to give a political push to the negotiations. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told the delegates, `` The time has come to take concerted political action at a high level.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said the conference should also examine the question of how to control and verify any future chemical weapons accord. The conference was formally proposed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> had said earlier he was looking for such an initiative. French officials stress that the final communique, to be issued Wednesday, is political in nature, and that binding agreements must come from <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, where delegates from 40 nations are at work. According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates, about 20 nations have or are capable of producing chemical arms.

 Three officials of a zoo in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have been charged with aiding poachers and buying illegally trapped monkeys, an official report said Saturday. Officials of the zoo in <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> province, were accused of buying 12 golden-haired monkeys from poachers, the People's Daily said. Zoo director <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiawan </PERSON>, deputy director <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Peilin </PERSON>, and head manager <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hzncheng </PERSON> allegedly provided the poachers with food, transportation and other help. The monkeys, native to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and listed as an endangered species, are illegal to hunt. Some Chinese believe their bones, blood, meat and internal organs have medicinal value. More than 200 golden-haired monkeys have been killed by poachers since 1970, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, recently approved its first wildlife protection law, intended to stem poaching of rare species of animals.

 <PERSON> Ante </PERSON> <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>, a strong supporter of market - oriented reforms and a leader of the republic of <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, is the leading candidate to become <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s new premier, newspapers said today Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> and his government resigned Dec. 30 after being criticized for failing to curb the country's 250 percent annual inflation rate and other economic problems. It was the first time the government of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> resigned since the communists took power after World War II. `` The most serious candidate to become <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s new premier is <PERSON> Ante </PERSON> <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Vecernje </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> daily. Mikulic is to stay in office as caretaker premier until the nine-member federal presidency names a new premier, probably by the end of January. The new <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to be installed in February, will probably include Foreign Minister <PERSON> Budimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Loncar </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Veljko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadijevic </PERSON>, both of whom resigned, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>, an electrical engineer who had managed a large Yugoslav company, is currently a member of the collective presidency of the northern republic of <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>. He has often advocated radical market-oriented changes and demanded reforms in the country's political system <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> also has called for economic reforms, but he did not favor major changes in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s communist political system. During a recent <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting, <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> said the authorities `` should not scare Yugoslavs by saying reforms would bring social upheavals and unemployment, since we already face such problems today.'' Workers last year staged a record 1,400 strikes, and many Yugoslavs have called for a multi-party political system.

<HEAD>All Eyes On Bush Even Though It's Not His Name On Budget</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will keep the sideline seat he has occupied for the past eight years when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sends his final budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but this time all eyes will be on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because the next moves clearly will be his to make. The vice president, who repeatedly touted a vague `` flexible freeze'' to pare the federal deficit during his campaign, has been equally mum about details during the transition period. But, with the formal submission of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s $ 1.15 trillion spending plan out of the way Monday, attention will shift quickly to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` There's no question, his first test of leadership will be on this issue,'' Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> carries through on his vow and produces a credible spending plan that holds the increase in overall spending to the rate of inflation, `` then I think that could very well be the basis for negotiation and for compromise with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> continued. `` If, on the other hand, he walks away from that challenge in some way, then obviously we are facing a potential for confrontation.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he will outline his budget priorities in an address to a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> soon after he takes office, following <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1981 example. He has indicated he wo n't submit a complete new budget, but will spell out what he'll `` add here and take off there.'' The amendments, which have yet to take shape, will embody <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s key priorities and reiterate his oft-stated pledge not to raise taxes, transition officials said Clearly, many of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s pet budget projects _ selling off a host of federal assets, wholesale abolition of programs and agencies and the `` privatization'' of federal functions _ are n't high on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s list of priorities, based on his campaign statements. And he will have to make room in his budget outline for the `` kinder, gentler nation'' proposals he talked about so much before the election, including $ 2.2 billion in child-care tax incentives, $ 600 million in additional promised funds for education and increasing spending for environmental cleanup. But, basically, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at least has given <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a spending outline that generally conforms with the vice president's `` flexible freeze'' goal without advocating new taxes. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget is expected to envision a federal fiscal 1990 deficit of $ 92.5 billion, lower than the $ 100 billion target of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law and a sharp decline from the $ 155 billion projected in the current fiscal year. And <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s expected call for $ 1.15 billion in overall spending represents a 4.5 percent increase over this year's anticipated $ 1.10 billion spending level. That's close to the estimated 4.4 percent annual rate of inflation the Consumer Price Index posted for 1988. In other words, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget in numbers alone adds up to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` flexible freeze.'' While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his lieutenants have maintained a low profile in the preparation of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget, his choice for budget director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, has made frequent trips to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to meet with Republican budget writers. In the meetings, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> indicated the forthcoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposals would be general, and that the incoming president would put greater emphasis on negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, according to participants. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> amendments are more likely to reflect overall targets for major programs rather than a program-by-program list of specific increases and offsetting cuts, the congressional sources said. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> all along has advocated a series of quiet negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to forge a budget consensus. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he would send his budget negotiating team, headed by <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, to meet with congressional leaders at the outset of his presidency. However, both Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have to do more than just negotiate; he would have to come up with his own set of proposals to have negotiating credibility. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promoted some new programs that the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, the senior <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been a part of this -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- budget. He has to do his own, produce his own changes.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> so far has been `` laying low,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an aide to House Republican Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think they're prepared at this point to begin specific discussions on the Hill They'll wait until after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is inaugurated to do that.'' Still, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> has been kept closely informed on details of the preparation of the final <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> _ a close <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> confidant whom the vice president has announced he will retain _ played a role in shaping it. In fact, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> will be one of the administration's principal briefers on the document after its release Monday. Outgoing Budget Director <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> suggested the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget would be a good starting point for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` This is a very good thing, for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to propose as he is going out and then <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can go in there and negotiate,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, who will occupy the same post in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency, has said the two men differ somewhat in specifics but `` they are in general agreement about budget policy.'' But, he emphasized, the spending plan `` is a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration budget and not a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration budget.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> echoed that sentiment: `` Let's see what the president does and then when the ball is in my court and the buck is stopping at my desk, I may have something else to say about matters of this nature.''

<HEAD>Dropping Two Counts Against North Called Aid to Prosecutors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The prosecution's request to drop the most sweeping and controversial Iran-Contra charges against <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> could make it easier to put the former presidential aide on trial, legal experts say. The most politically explosive charges, alleging a conspiracy to divert to Nicaraguan rebels $ 14 million in proceeds from U.S.-Iran arms sales, will be gone if the dismissal move by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> succeeds. But some experts say that would leave a `` lean and mean'' case against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, free of problems that have bogged down the proceedings for months. District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> will decide whether to grant the dismissal motion. If he does, prosecutors will still be able to try the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide on 12 felony charges, including allegations that he shredded documents and lied both to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a presidential inquiry in an effort to conceal his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. `` The sex appeal part of this case is always the conspiracy,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brand </ORGANIZATION>. `` But there is still a substantial case left.'' `` Lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and obstruction of justice are not small matters, if in fact that's what happened,'' said <PERSON> Brand </PERSON>, a former counsel to the House of Representatives. `` Lying to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may be worse'' than actually diverting arms-sale proceeds to help the Contras at a time lawmakers had banned such assistance to the rebels, <PERSON> Brand </PERSON> said. `` The public's perception of this and what it says about the distribution of powers among the branches of government is as important to me as whether anybody goes to jail,'' he added. The remaining counts carry prison terms totaling 60 years. They include charges that <PERSON> North </PERSON> lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and 1986 about his involvement in the covert Contra resupply operation. North also is accused of accepting installation of a $ 13,800 security fence around his suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> home, pocketing at least $ 4,300 in travelers checks from <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and illegally using a tax-exempt foundation to raise money for the rebels. Other counts charge that <PERSON> North </PERSON> lied to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and destroyed official documents during the Nov. 20-23, 1986, presidential investigation of the Iran-Contra affair. Since the indictment was returned March 16, a number of federal prosecutors have privately criticized <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> for bringing a broad conspiracy charge against <PERSON> North </PERSON> and his three co-defendants. These prosecutors questioned the wisdom of trying to criminalize the conduct of North, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. But many of these same prosecutors also supported the decision to charge North with destroying documents and lying to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last fall filed a brief criticizing a legal theory <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> used to support the conspiracy charge, saying it would set a dangerous precedent for prosecuting government officials whose conduct had not actually violated any laws. Brand rejected this criticism of <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s use of the conspiracy statute, a popular law among federal prosecutors in other cases. `` It was fine with those guys to use it against politicians when they thought it was in their interest,'' he said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> successfully defended the legality of the charges he brought against <PERSON> North </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> refused to dismiss all but two of the 16 original charges. From the start, however, there was a problem about the conspiracy and theft charges. North's defense against the charges _ that he thought he was acting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s permission _ hinged in part on highly secret information about covert operations. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, meanwhile, stuck to his ruling that the prosecution must disclose more information than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration wanted released in open court. That prompted <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> on Thursday to seek dismissal of the key charges, a motion in all likelihood <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> will grant at a hearing Monday. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s decision prompted charges that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration deliberately held back releasing some secrets to help scuttle the major charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON>. But Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> defended the administration, noting that when <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> informed him of the decision the independent counsel did not complain that the intelligence agencies had treated him unfairly. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> himself said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s decision `` satisfies our problem, which has been concern.. about national security. North's lawyer, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said in a statement that `` although the heart of its case is destroyed, the independent counsel continues to toy with Col. North.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> vowed to continue to press the secrecy issue on the remaining charges, stating that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> `` apparently refuses to recognize that classified information pervades the remaining charges as well.'' But <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Tribe </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor who has done some work for <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office, said the secrecy problems will be `` radically reduced'' once the conspiracy and theft charges are dismissed. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> will have `` a lean and mean version of the prosecution,'' <PERSON> Tribe </PERSON> said. `` With must of the most dramatic conspiracy and theft elements removed.. -LRB- <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> -RRB- can proceed without the cloud of national security'' hanging over the case

<HEAD>Teflon Coating May Be Wearing Thin For District Of Columbia Mayor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In his 10 years as leader of the nation's capital, <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has earned the sobriquet `` mayor for life'' and a reputation for withstanding embarrassment and scandal that would wither any other politician In the past two weeks, though, there have been indications his industrial-strength coating of political Teflon may be wearing thin. The latest episode to ensnarl <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has triggered a federal grand jury investigation and raised new allegations of drug use, corruption, consorting with criminals, and interference with a criminal investigation. `` It's worse than the other scrapes he has gotten into,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, leader of 125 storefront, independent, predominantly black churches across the city. `` The grassroots that's been behind the mayor, he's losing them,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` And he'll lose them as he goes along.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s latest problems began three days before Christmas when <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> police detectives went to investigate a suspected drug dealer at a hotel bordering a seedy area. They encountered one of the mayor's security guards. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was in the room of the suspect. Police left without talking to the man, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. He checked out he next day. A search of the room later turned up traces of cocaine, but <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> denied any drug use, and authorities said there was no way to determine how recently cocaine had been in the room. From there the story, reported in daily detail by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and other local news outlets, has taken a variety of twists _ none of them good for <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>. Police said they were investigating a complaint by a hotel maid that the man <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> visited had offered her drugs in exchange for sex. The newspaper reported the police were `` called back'' from their investigation of <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> after confronting <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s security agent. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> acknowledged he made several calls to the assistant police chief, <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulwood </PERSON>, and others, but denied trying to interfere or pressure the investigation. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> gave conflicting accounts of why he was there, and of how many times he had visited the man. And <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who dropped from sight for several days before resurfacing in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, had a long history of contact with <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>. A native of the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, he had headed an agreement between the islands' government and the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> government for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> officials to provide consulting help on personnel matters. But he was fired amid concern about free spending by visiting <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> government officials who stayed in expensive resort hotels in the islands. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> himself made at least one trip there in connection with the project. Auditors for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territories including the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, were already investigating that arrangement. Inspector General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said they found little documentation of expenses, and no trace of even a contract. There were more damaging details, but <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> angrily blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and others in the media in his first public statements. He later apologized for the <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> episode and said, `` I'm guilty of poor judgment, no question.'' As only the second elected mayor since rule over <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, was released by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> 15 years ago, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has been a powerful symbol for many of the residents of the city that is 70 percent black. He grew to represent both the aspirations of the city's downtrodden and the success of its black elite. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who is black, emerged from the civil rights movement of the 1960s, where he was a leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or <ORGANIZATION> SNCC </ORGANIZATION>. A tough-talking figure of the streets who favored wearing colorful African dashikis, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> slowly earned respect from and drew closer to the political mainstream through neighborhood work and service on first the school board and later the city council. By the time he ran for mayor in 1978, he had attracted support from the white establishment. He won re-election twice with two-thirds or more of the vote, leading to the conclusion the job was his for as long as he wanted. But along the way <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> raised plenty of eyebrows with reports of womanizing and innuendo of possible drug use. A dozen city officials have been convicted on corruption charges under his administration, including two deputy mayors. One of them, <PERSON> Ivanhoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, was <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s closest friend and political alter ego. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> himself was the object of a highly publicized investigation by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office that ended in 1987. There were allegations that close friends of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> paid hush money to a convicted cocaine dealer, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who is married, acknowledged a personal relationship with the woman, but denied buying or using drugs. She served a prison term on contempt of court charges for refusing to testify about <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> to a grand jury. Later a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> magazine published what it said was her diary, naming <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> and grading his sexual performance. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has survived embarrassments involving other women and his frequent absenses from the city. His problems this time seem most serious in part because of the issue of drugs and the heightened concern over that issue. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has been leading a public crusade against drug use in a city where open-air drug markets operate, some in close view of the Capitol dome. Violence has accompanied the explosion in drugs, and homicides came at a rate of more than one a day in 1988. By the account of city hall insiders, support for <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> is eroding even among his own appointed officials. One long-time ally, speaking on condition he not be identified by name, pointed to pictures of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> on his own office wall and said, sadly: `` This was taken three years ago, but he's aged 10 years since then. He really seems like he's on a self-destructive course.'' A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> television station, <ORGANIZATION> WRC </ORGANIZATION>, conducted a poll last week of 400 <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> residents and reported nearly half thought he should resign; 40 percent thought he was involved with drugs. `` Some of his support may have eroded,'' said city council member <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who is black. `` I think a lot of people are waiting to see what the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney and others are coming up with in this situation. You've got to realize we've been through this three or four times before. Each time they've not come up with anything to indict the mayor or force him from office.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s term expires in 1990, and he has not yet indicated whether he will run for re-election.

<HEAD>Chemical Weapons _ Long A Concern To France</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 From the muddy trenches of World War I to the lofty chambers of <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> today, the subject of chemical warfare has long been of concern to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. French troops were among the first victims of the deadly, yellow chlorine gas released by the Germans at <LOCATION> Ypres </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, on April 22, 1915. An estimated 5,000 men died and 15,000 others were incapacitated in what is considered the beginning of 20th-century chemical war. About a month later, 6,000 more men in the trenches suffocated from inhaling phosgene gas used by the Germans on the Russian front. By the end of World War I, chlorine, phosgene and mustard gas had been established as chemical weapons. Public revulsion at their use brought about the international agreement in 1925 banning the use of chemical and bacteriological agents. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ which acknowledges it has the capability of making chemical weapons but has never admitted possessing them _ is custodian of the 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Protocol, holding the original document in the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and accepting additional signatories to it over the years. Successive governments have made much of the moral responsiblity implied in serving as custodian, and the feeling was the backdrop against which President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> proposed <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> play host to the international conference on chemical weapons that began Saturday. Not everyone, however, saw <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> as the best choice for the five-day conference. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> was the `` least qualified'' to host the meeting because of its estimated $ 5 billion worth of arms sales to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> during the eight-year <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. `` In view of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s indirect condonement of the Iraqi regime's actions during the war and in view of the fact that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is one country which flagrantly used chemical weapons ... any Western capital would have been a better and happier choice,'' the newspaper said Both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have accused the other of using poison gas. It is known that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used mustard gas during the war. Both are signatories to the protocol.

 Boat people fleeing poverty in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> are boarding flimsy motor boats and braving a hazardous 90-mile stretch of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> to reach <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, gateway to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Many of the illegal aliens drown during the three-day voyage. Most who make it ashore later pose as Puerto Ricans to slip past immigration officials and board flights to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> say they do n't have enough manpower to halt the exodus, which has increased sharply in recent months as the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> economy worsens. The <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> has a population of 6 million, and as many as 30,000 try to leave each year, officials estimate. They say no more than 10 percent to 20 percent of Dominicans illegally entering <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> are caught. Some 3,000 people were detained in 1988. The rest either make it or drown. Authorities complain that the problem is n't getting the attention it deserves because it's happening so far from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commonwealth, is 1,000 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` There are human beings dying, and they also pose an economic threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; but the consciousness of this is zero,'' said Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caster </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s Greater Antilles Command <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the Dominican exodus has reached the scale of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s in 1985, when thousands of boat people were intercepted by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and hundreds of others washed up on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s shores. `` The only difference is that Haitians were dying off the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coast,'' said <PERSON> Caster </PERSON>, who also led the Haitian operation. Another difference is that the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has an agreement with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> allowing the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to board Haitian boats to check for illegal aliens. The agreement resulted in the arrest of some 4,000 Haitians in 1988. There is no such accord with the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> government, although talks are to start in the new year about signing one. `` We are focusing on the drug problem, not aliens,'' said <PERSON> Caster </PERSON>. `` We do n't go out looking for Dominicans. We're coming across them on our patrols and when we do, it invariably turns out to be a rescue operation.'' `` The boats are in such bad shape and the people are in so much danger, they are thankful to be taken anywhere,'' he said. Facing 30 percent unemployment rate and 60 percent inflation, Dominicans are lured to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in search of jobs and to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> is spoken here and Puerto Ricans are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. A Dominican who can pass for a Puerto Rican does n't need documents or a passport to fly to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where most illegal Dominicans end up Authorities concede it is easy for Dominicans to get past immigration officials at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>'s airport with a well-rehearsed `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' when asked where they're from. `` There are n't that many differences between the languages and cultures'' of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, the district director of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. He said more than 1 million Dominicans are in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, most of them illegally. `` If the family never hears from them, they assume they made it safely. They do n't think anybody drowned,'' said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. About 100 bodies were recovered in a two-month period alone in 1988. `` But we never find the bodies when they drown in the high seas. We suspect there's quite a number though,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>, the federal agency set up a year ago in the <LOCATION> northwest </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Aguadilla </LOCATION> where most Dominicans arrive. Dominicans take on the 90-mile <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Passage </PERSON> in fragile, wooden fishing boats loaded with up to 80 people. They usually wear no life jackets or other safety equipment. `` They do n't know the first thing about navigating in the most hazardous conditions in one of the most dangerous waters of the world,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. Clashing winds from the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> can whip up 20-foot swells in the Mona Passage. It's a trip even the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> avoid on rough days. Dominicans sell stoves and refigerators to raise the $ 500 smugglers charge for the journey. The price is $ 3,000 if a plane ticket to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is included. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanches </PERSON>, a 30-year-old fisherman recently arrested off the cost of <LOCATION> Aguadilla </LOCATION>, said he sold everything he had for the trip. `` If hunger is going to kill me, I prefer to be killed escaping,'' he said. `` What I want to do is work, but there are no jobs at home.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrols 1.3 million square miles with seven large patrol boats, four smaller boats, four helicopters and three planes. The Border Patrol has 17 agents and two boats for a 30-mile coastline. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said it would take 200 agents to halt the exodus.

 <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials said a pipeline rupture that sent 840,000 gallons of oil into the <LOCATION> Gasconade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> last month may have been caused by a malfunction at an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> refinery that temporarily increased pressure in the line. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Canino </PERSON> said Friday that pressure increased in the pipeline laid in 1948 while valves at a refinery in <LOCATION> Wood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, 170 miles east of the spill site in central <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, were switching some crude oil from the <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> pipeline into another line operated by <ORGANIZATION> Marathon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Canino </PERSON> said company officials have not determined what caused the malfunction The oil from the spill, one of the worst inland spills in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, made its way from the <LOCATION> Gasconade </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and from there to the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> said a federal inspector visited the spill site last week to determine if <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> violated any regulations in its operation of the 435-mile pipeline, which runs from <LOCATION> Cushing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, to <PERSON> Roxanna </PERSON>, Ill. The oil lost in the <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> spill is more than three times larger than the amount lost in all pipeline accidents in 1987, the last year for which figures are available, said the spokeswoman, <PERSON> Suzette </PERSON> <PERSON> Paes </PERSON>. The oil erupted from a 35-foot rupture in a buried pipeline near the <LOCATION> Gasconade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, about 140 miles west of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. Also Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> announced that it had recalled 1,500 of 2,000 bottlers and brewers laid off Tuesday when production shut down after tasters noticed an oily aroma to the water used for brewing the beer.

<HEAD>Akihito Ascends Chrysanthemum Throne In Ancient Ceremony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With AM-Hirohito, Bjt ^By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a short, silent ceremony soon after the death of his father, Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> on Saturday ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne and received the mythic symbols of imperial legitimacy _ a sword and jewels. The ancient ceremony began when the new emperor, clad in black morning coat and gray trousers and accompanied by six male members of the imperial family, entered the <LOCATION> Matsu </LOCATION> no Ma Hall of the Imperial Palace. For the first time, reporters were allowed to witness the somber ritual, which later was broadcast on national television. Journalists were led through dimly lit, concrete tunnels to the palace, where they watched through tinted windows that hid them from those at the ceremony. It lasted just four minutes. Taking his place before a purple and gold folding screen and high-backed wooden chair bearing the imperial chrysanthemum crest, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> stood facing the official witnesses _ Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, 19 Cabinet ministers, the four heads of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and two <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges. The government leaders later were joined by top <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officials and chamberlains. All wore morning coats and black ties. With bows, three palace officials presented the seals and two encased objects of the regalia _ a sword and jewels _ then placed them on short wooden tables before the emperor. The third regalia item, a mirror, is kept at a shrine on the palace grounds. The regalia, which have deep religious significance to followers of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s native Shinto religion, have never been displayed in public and were encased throughout the rite. After exchanging bows with those present, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> left the room preceded by the sword bearer and followed by the chamberlain carrying the jewels. The imperial and state seals, carried in two purple pouches, were removed after other members of the imperial family had left. For centuries the regalia have symbolized the divine origin of the world's oldest imperial family. According to legend, the mirror was used by the deities to lure the sun goddess <ORGANIZATION> Amaterasu </ORGANIZATION> out of self-imposed seclusion on the High Celestial Plain and the jewels were given to her after she emerged. The sword was a token of repentance by her brother, who drew it from a giant eight-tailed, eight-headed snake he killed after being banished from the divine highland for misconduct. <ORGANIZATION> Amaterasu </ORGANIZATION> later gave the regalia to her grandson, <PERSON> Ninigi </PERSON> no Mikoto, before sending him to conquer the Japanese islands. He passed them on to <PERSON> Jimmu </PERSON>, another descendant of the sun goddess who by legend was <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s first ruler. Today, the supposed original mirror is kept at the Grand Shrine of Ise, the center of Shinto sun goddess worship 200 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The `` original'' sword is at the <ORGANIZATION> Atsuta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shrine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nagoya </LOCATION>, central <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and the `` original'' jewels, said to be comma-shaped stones, are kept at the Imperial Palace in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Replicas of the sword and mirror, themselves ancient, are used in imperial ascension ceremonies. Until his death Saturday, Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> slept in a room where the jewels and replica sword are stored.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> today called for direct negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to resolve a dispute over a <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> factory <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials claim was built to produce chemical weapons. The Libyan leader made the statement at <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>'s best hotel, where he arrived unexpectedly to speak to foreign reporters. It was his first public appearance since two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> jets shot down two Libyan MiGs over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must understand that her policy of surrounding us and using force against us will absolutely fail,'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said, speaking softly in Arabic. `` They must negotiate with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> directly and they should sit at the negotiating table with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> without their weapons to achieve peace in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>,'' he said. He was ringed by bodyguards during his appearance in a hotel lobby lounge. `` I think the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will be able to do this because they will have learned their lessons of the previous administration. There have been enough lessons. They will have learned that force does not pay, especially with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said. `` We will not respond to force, only to politeness and direct negotiations.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> brushed aside <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s call for direct negotiations. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, attending a chemical warfare conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, said, `` Communications is not the problem, the problem is Libyan policy.'' But the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, also said, `` I am not ruling anything in or out.'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Thursday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been able to stay in touch with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> through intermediaries. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s five-minute-long statement was translated into English by a Libyan who works for the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The Libyan leader's curly hair was topped by a black, wool pillbox hat. He wore a maroon-and-blue sweater, covered by a brown wool cape, to protect him from <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>'s rainy weather. Asked about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressures on his country, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> vowed never to bow to the Americans, `` even if this confrontation lasts 1 million years.'' The unexpected sight of a smiling <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> in the hotel set off chaos. Journalists and camera crews knocked over potted plants, scrambled atop chairs and climbed over a two-story-high ornamental fountain inside the lobby. Sources in the capital said <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> had not been seen in public for several weeks, and there was speculation he had fled in fear of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack. Tensions between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> have increased because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has built a chemical weapons factory in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, 60 miles from the capital. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has insisted the plant will manufacture medicine. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said he could not rule out a military strike against the site. In 1986, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> was bombed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in to retaliate for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s alleged support for terrorism. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> told reporters today that the administration of President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` should sit with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to discuss face-to-face cases of dispute. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is absolutely against terrorism but we are beside the just struggle for just causes.'' He added: `` The Palestinian peoples' stuggle for a free Palestine is a just struggle and we will never hesitate to support it.'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s regime came to power in 1969 with a coup that ousted a Western-backed monarchy. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have another lesson from the failure of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s childish policies, which gain nothing,'' said <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> and other Libyan officials offered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a one-time inspection of the <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> plant, but the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration rejected that offer, saying <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> could disguise the plant for the inspection and then restore its chemical weapons' capabilities <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> told reporters today: `` <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> will participate in all negotiations to get rid of all weapons from ordinary guns to nuclear bombs. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must get rid of its chemical and nuclear weapons factories and cancel the ` Star Wars' program,'' refering to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research for a space-based defense system. `` All nations of the world must agree to get rid of weapons and settle for peace. If this does not happen, we have only confrontation. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> will never surrender and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will lose,'' said <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> will accept the participation of any international committee to inspect Israeli factories and factories in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and any spot of the world,'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> concluded in his statement. On Friday, the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> government charged at a news conference and in official media that its planes were overwhelmed Wednesday by 14 `` hostile American aircraft.'' A government spokesman maintained the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> report that two <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> jets had acted in self-defense was `` a fabrication.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> provided the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media with videotape taken by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft of the encounter and showed photographs to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of what it said was a heavily armed Libyan plane involved in the encounter.

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> attacked Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' proposal to postpone this month's Central American peace summit. Other leaders said they still plan to attend. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for spearheading a regional peace plan, said Friday the summit planned for Jan. 15-16 should be postponed to give President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> time to formulate his policy in the region. `` The great irony is that President <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, the great creator of the <ORGANIZATION> Esquipulas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plan </ORGANIZATION> _ for which he was given the Nobel Prize _ could be the same person that buries the plan,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Friday night. He was speaking at an awards ceremony for <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, visiting secretary-general of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Fixing the dates of Jan. 15 and 16 was proof by the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> governments that we were n't going to be waiting until the new <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government assumed power to debate our problems and look for a solution,'' he said. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> also said he and his counterparts in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> need more time to prepare for the meeting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The presidents had planned to talk about how to revive the peace plan they signed in 1987. Although some progress had been made, the plan now is stalled in all the countries it applied to. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' proposal could `` practically kill'' previous peace accords between the Central American nations. Honduran and Guatemalan officials said they still plan to attend. `` I'm still preparing for the meeting,'' President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> of <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> hinted to a news conference that Central American leaders may get more support for their plan from the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration `` did n't fully understand the plan for peace in Central America'', <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said, while `` the statements of Mr. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> make it appear that there is a commitment to give diplomatic support to resolving the conflicts in Central America.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels, who are trying to overthrow <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government. It backs the governments of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> in their conflicts with leftist rebels and considers <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> strong allies. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' peace plan called for cease-fires, political amnesties and negotiations between guerrillas and the governments of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. A cease-fire has been in effect between the Contras and the Nicaraguan government since March 1988, and the level of fighting there has dropped drastically. But fighting continues in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and has escalated in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.

The book of six stories, `` Fireside Memories,'' was mailed last week to 200 people who helped keep the <ORGANIZATION> Hattiesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> going during the past year. The 24-page book is partly a `` thank you'' to those who have given time and money to the literacy project, but it's also a way to get the students interested in writing, said Project Director <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Boss </PERSON>, volunteer coordinator for the center, first proposed to students that they write stories for publication, the answer was `` No way,'' <PERSON> Boss </PERSON> said. Some of the adult students do n't want to let their friends and coworkers know they have trouble reading, <PERSON> Boss </PERSON> said. But eventually, six students agreed to put their ideas in print. Some wrote their stories alone, others dictated to a tutor. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who has been working with tutor <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> for two years, wrote poetically about colors of Christmas: `` With all of its beauty of red, gold and silver and the pure white snow which stands for God's pure love for us all.'' `` We talked about writing what Christmas meant to him,'' <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said. `` He came in with it, and it was written. It was not all in complete sentences, but I did n't want to touch it; it was free verse. The only things I changed were some possible spellings.''

 What would a legal document be without a few `` heretofores'' and `` forthwiths?''

The deadline is Jan. 15, and <PERSON> Neiditz </PERSON> is hoping to receive at least 100 entries. `` Lawyers have been my most difficult clients because they all assume they can write. They're extremely sensitive to anyone criticizing them,'' <PERSON> Nieditz </PERSON> said. `` There is a tremendous amount of extra verbiage and pomposity,'' she said. `` So, I thought it would be an exciting first project for the institute to create this competition for the best legal brief.'' Briefs will be screened initially by members of the <ORGANIZATION> UConn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. Then a panel of six judges will make the final selection. Some details of the contest are still to be worked out. For instance, <PERSON> Neiditz </PERSON> does n't know how many runners-up will be named, she does n't know when the winners will be announced, and she does n't know if cash prizes will be given, although she's hoping they will In the event of a tie, <PERSON> Neiditz </PERSON> will cast the deciding vote.

 April LaSalata, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Croff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lydia </PERSON> <PERSON> Grohoski </PERSON> all turned to the courts to ward off their estranged husbands. But the long arm of the law was not long enough or strong enough to prevent their murders. In the past two weeks, all three <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> women, who had obtained court orders of protection from their estranged or former husbands, were shot to death by those men. Each man then killed himself. `` We did our damnedest to protect her,'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's family crime bureau, said of the most recent victim, Mrs. <PERSON> LaSalata </PERSON>, who was killed Tuesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>, choking back tears, said: `` We knew for about a year of horrendous fear that she lived with every day. We tried everything to help her _ short of placing an armed, 24-hour guard in front of her house _ and we failed her.'' It is a refrain becoming unnervingly common on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Croff </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islip </LOCATION> was chased down and shot to death by her ex-husband, <PERSON> William </PERSON>, as she clutched her 2-year-old daughter Dec. 30. She obtained a court order of protection almost a month before. She called police on at least five occasions seeking to have him arrested but was told they could make an arrest only if her husband was there when they arrived. On Dec. 26, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Grohoski </PERSON> invaded his estranged wife's <LOCATION> Southold </LOCATION> home and shot her in the face with a shotgun before killing himself. She, too, had an order of protection, and police had gone to the couple's home four or five times in the past year on calls of domestic violence. Police pointed out that the killings all occurred during the holidays, when family violence tends to escalate. But it was possible, police said, that one shooting inspired another, copycat style. They also inspired hysteria. Organizations that aid battered women reported a flood of calls from women whose fears were aggravated by reports of the murders. <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities point to a year-old policy that police make arrests rather than encourage mediation in domestic violence. Arrests increased from 126 in 1987 to 1,200 in 1988. <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Regan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputy attorney, said of 1,930 protective orders by <ORGANIZATION> Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last year, 275 were violated. `` An order of protection can not stop a psychotic killer,'' she said. `` But most husbands are not psychotic killers.'' It was not the first attack on Mrs. LaSalata. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> LaSalata </PERSON> was charged with trying to kill his 34-year-old ex-wife in February, months after their eight-year marriage was dissolved. He broke into her house, cut her telephone lines and stabbed her with a hunting knife. The couple's son ran to a neighbor, who called police. LaSalata was ordered held on $ 25,000 bail on charges of assault and attempted murder despite pleas by the district attorney for a higher bond. When LaSalata posted bail after eight months in jail, police installed a sophisticated alarm in Mrs. <PERSON> LaSalata </PERSON>'s home to automatically alert police if anyone broke in. They also gave her a hand-held electronic device to signal police in an emergency. Patrol cars carried a picture of LaSalata so they could identify him if he appeared in her neighborhood. Mrs. <PERSON> LaSalata </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Principio </PERSON>, went to her daughter's house every night so someone was home when Mrs. <PERSON> LaSalata </PERSON> returned from work. The protection order did not dispel Mrs. <PERSON> LaSalata </PERSON>'s fears. In October, she told authorities that her former husband drove past her house and stared at her. The prosecutor sought higher bail. Judge <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzei </PERSON> refused. <PERSON> Mazzei </PERSON> refused to increase bail on another occasion when Mrs. <PERSON> LaSalata </PERSON> claimed her husband had called her and breathed heavily into the phone. `` The only reason for bail is to return a defendant to court, and he had made all his court appearances,'' said <PERSON> Mazzei </PERSON>. `` We do n't have preventive detention in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Weeks ago, Mrs. <PERSON> LaSalata </PERSON> made a will and chose an urn for her cremation. `` She knew she was going to die,'' said her mother. Mrs. <PERSON> LaSalata </PERSON> was gunned down in front of her <LOCATION> Brentwood </LOCATION> house as she returned home from work Tuesday. On Friday, her husband's body was found with a rifle in the front seat of his car at a highway rest stop. <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> law enforcement officials have asked the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to upgrade violations of protection orders from misdemeanors to felonies. <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> announced that henceforth, a judge would be available every night to issue arrest warrants. That did little to appease Mrs. <PERSON> LaSalata </PERSON>'s mother. `` The system stinks,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Principio </PERSON>. `` If it was the judge's daughter, he would not have let him out on bail.'' <PERSON> Mazzei </PERSON> dismissed his critics as Monday-morning quarterbacks. `` This is a human tragedy,'' he said. `` It's the kind of thing that can drive a judge crazy.''

 The number of students entering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nursing schools rose 11 percent last year, after falling nearly a third from 1983 to 1987, according to a survey of more than 220 schools across the nation. Schools responding to the annual survey, to be published Monday by the trade magazine <ORGANIZATION> Nursingworld </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, had a total of 15,494 freshmen in 1988, up from 13,970 a year earlier. The magazine's publisher, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON>, attributed the turnaround primarily to rising salaries and plentiful job opportunities. `` Probably the most important thing is that there has been so much publicity about the national shortage of nurses,'' he said Friday. But a more troubling factor, <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> said, is that many schools have reduced minimum entry level grade-point averages to attract more applicants. Perhaps as a result, he said, graduate nurses failed their licensing exams at a record rate of 16 percent in 1988, four times the level of 1987. Hospital officials hailed the survey's finding as good news for the nation's health care system. It has been strained by a `` significant and persistent shortage'' of nurses, according to a December report by the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Nursing of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're going through a period where there's a wrenching change in need for intensive nursing, because <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and other cities are faced with a pandemic of AIDS. We need more nurses, not less,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bander </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Two critically burned patients were turned away in August 1988 from the only hospital in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> with a special burn unit because of a shortage of nurses and, in February, the largest hospital on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> began refusing non-emergency cases because of a lack of nurses. Some 300,000 nursing jobs were unfilled nationwide, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> estimated last year. And the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said the biggest demand for any single occupation between 1988 and the end of the century would be for registered nurses. <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> said the shortage has had a direct impact on wages, pushing up starting salaries for registered nurses by an average of $ 5,000 to $ 6,000 over the last five years. Registered nurses now typically start at $ 22,000 to $ 28,000 a year, depending on the region of the country, and experienced nurses earn up to $ 55,000 in some cities, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Nursingworld </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> said it sent its survey to 1,491 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nursing schools and received responses from 227 institutions in 44 states. According to the survey, licensed practical nursing programs experienced the greatest increase in entering students in 1988, reporting a 25.4 percent jump. Hospital-based diploma programs were next, with a 14.6 percent rise. Bachelor's degree programs at four-year colleges and universities saw a 10.7 percent increase. The smallest change was in associate degree programs offered by two-year junior colleges, which reported 8.7 percent more freshmen. <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> cautioned that because of the decline in entrance requirements, the overall increase of 11 percent may not necessarily translate into an 11 percent rise in the number of nursing graduates. `` The problem it's going to create is that while we have roughly a big increase in freshman enrollees, they've lowered the admission standards, so we may have fewer people who are going to be able to make the grade,'' he said.

 State leaders are trying to make <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> less attractive to poor people considering moving there by offering new residents only as much in welfare as they would have received in their old state. Following a recent study that concluded the state was a `` welfare magnet,'' Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> is proposing to limit payments for incoming welfare recipients for their first three or six months in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, his aides said Friday. The Republican governor's plan, to be included in his budget message to the Legislature later this month, was revealed a day after a key Democrat, state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Strohl </PERSON>, advocated a similar plan. `` It is time that we Democrats admit that people really are moving here because of our higher benefits, and begin to address it,'' <PERSON> Strohl </PERSON> said. But others say the two-tiered benefit plan, even if it applies only during a resident's first few months in the state, is unconstitutional. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> says it's illegal to have a two-tiered system of benefits,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Steege </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Steege </PERSON> said each state `` has established a standard of need for welfare recipients, and no state can create a new class of citizens who are n't entitled to that.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1969 ruled a one-year waiting period for Aid to Families with Dependent Children benefits in several states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> was unconstitional because it created `` an invidious distinction'' among citizens. But lawmakers here said a two-tiered plan _ in effect, giving out lower benefits, rather than no benefits, for the first few months of residence _ has never gone before the court. <PERSON> Strohl </PERSON> said he was `` mildly optimistic'' the courts would uphold such a plan because it does not deny all benefits based on one's length of residency in the state A recent report from the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> that found 29 percent of new welfare cases in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> were people from other states. More than one-fourth of the new arrivals were from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, where a family of three receives $ 558 a month in AFDC benefits and food stamps. A family of three received a total off $ 542 a month in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Combined benefits for such a family in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> are $ 680 a month. <PERSON> Steege </PERSON> contended welfare recipients are attracted to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> for a variety of reasons, including its quality of life, lower crime rate, good schools, and to join family members who have previously moved there. In November, 83,216 families in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> received AFDC, compared with 72,646 in 1980.

<HEAD>President Touts 1990 Budget As `Responsible Plan'</HEAD>

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> touted his forthcoming budget today as a `` responsible plan'' that will cut the deficit and assure <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s prosperity without raising taxes. `` I leave as I came _ dead set against any new taxes,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in the next-to-last radio address of his presidency. The five-minute talk was taped on Friday because the president entered <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for surgery today to correct a curvature of his left ring finger. The president's final spending plan is due out Monday, a $ 1.15 trillion budget that is said to propose the elimination of 82 government programs while protecting his two-term defense buildup. It covers the 1990 fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1. But since President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is slated to take office on Jan. 20, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s document has been branded in some quarters as irrelevant. `` It's a responsible plan which cuts the deficit without touching Social Security, weakening defense, or reducing benfits to the needy,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asserted. `` And the best news is that this budget proves it can be done without raising your taxes.'' `` Raising taxes would be the surest way to kill the economic goose that lays the golden eggs,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president argued that his plan will contain additional funds for air safety, fighting crime, housing the poor, the war on drugs, and the space program, as well as fighting Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. The president also warned that his defense buildup must be maintained, saying, it is `` the price of peace and security for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` My fiscal year 1990 budget provides for the needy, does not raise taxes, and by controlling the growth in spending, reduces the deficit next year by nearly $ 70 billion,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` This budget is a realistic program which protects the working families of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, provides adequate support for those who depend on government and helps assure <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s prosperity for years to come,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president also put in a plug for his decision this week to back the large pay raise for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, judges and top executive branch officials that has been recommended by a presidential commission. `` We must be willing to pay for excellence in government or risk a government run only by people of wealth or by those beholden to special interests,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said. The 50 percent pay raise will be come law automatically unless each house of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejects it by Feb. 8. The plan includes a ban on outside speaking fees and other certain income and will formally be sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget on Monday. Giving the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radio speech was House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who expressed hopes for `` a new era of cooperation and good feelings'' between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House. Speaking about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, `` we in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership are eager to help him attain his announced goal of wider access for all Americans to education, to child care, to affordable housing and to a cleaner environment.'' `` We in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hope that the next administration, together with us, will usher in a new era of cooperation and good feelings between the legislative and executive branches of government,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>California Raisins Refuse To Parade at Inaugural</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Raisins are in the middle of a mild rhubarb and the ad-celebrities wo n't be marching in President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaugural parade. The wrinkled television stars were billed last week by parade coordinators as prominent characters in the 78-float parade, following the swearing-in on Jan. 20. But the people who run the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raisin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which bankrolls the famous corrugated crowd of TV ad fame, said it was news to them. The inaugural procession would include attractions `` from bell-ringers to bagpipes ... <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> raisins to rodeo queens,'' said the announcements on parade plans. `` I was surprised to read it,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Phinney </PERSON>, the board's director of advertising <PERSON> Phinney </PERSON> denied that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` damned dancing raisins'' campaign crack had anything to do with the board's refusal to have people in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Raisin costumes march in the parade. For more than two years, the board has promoted its product with the help of animated figures shaped like raisins, dancing to the 1960s song, `` I Heard it Through The Grapevine.'' Since then, raisin sales shot up 11 percent and more than 300 raisin dolls, shirts and other items have gone on store shelves. The human version of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Raisins, people in black tights under costumes, occasionally make public appearances, and during Christmastime First Lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> invited the furrowed fellows to help entertain children of foreign diplomats at a White House party. But the parade presented some new wrinkles. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, spokesman for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> inaugural committee, said the raisin marchers were selected by the Council on Physical Fitness to accompany its float, but that the raisin advisory board but the kibosh on the plans. `` We'd be pleased to have the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Raisins in the parade if -LRB- the board -RRB- wishes them to be there,'' he said. <PERSON> Phinney </PERSON> said the big hangup was the council's plan for the raisins to walk 2 -LCB- miles in their raisin outfits alongside the floats. Such a walk, said <PERSON> Phinney </PERSON>, would be too tough on the raisins. `` Our characters are known for their dancing,'' <PERSON> Phinney </PERSON> said. The absence of the raisins might not be terribly disappointing to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who will watch the parade from a reviewing stand in front of the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has already seen the raisins. They performed at a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign rally in <LOCATION> Kingsburg </LOCATION> _ important raisin country. On the final weekend of the campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joked that he canceled a planned return to the area because he did n't want to see `` those damned raisins again.'' <PERSON> Phinney </PERSON> insisted the wisecrack had nothing to do with the parade refusal, adding that the remark `` certainly did n't warm the cockles of our heart.''

 Prosecutors say the investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> corruption, which took more than six months to yield its first indictments, is just getting started. None of the indictments issued in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Friday involves high-ranking present or former military officials, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said the continuing inquiry promises to be a protracted affair. One defense contractor, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> employee and five other men were indicted on charges that included conspiracy and bribery, while another corporation pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the government. `` I think over the next few months, perhaps the next year, you'll see a great deal of additional activity,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said Friday, adding that the initial round of indictments represented a `` small percentage'' of the case `` It's a significant investigation and my assessment of its dimensions has n't changed in the last six or seven months,'' he said. Prosecutors have subpoenaed more than 1 million documents and spent `` many, many hours'' before the grand jury, he said. The big-rigging investigation hinges on allegations that private consultants, hired by defense contracting firms, paid bribes to government employees for inside information that gave them an advantage in securing multimillion-dollar contracts. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, who had once promised indictments in late fall, said he is satisfied with the pace of the complex case. `` I think if you'll compare this to others of its type ... this investigation is almost unprecedently quick,'' he said. Six months ago, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, declaring he was `` very upset'' about the reports of corruption in the Pentagon's $ 150-billion-a-year purchasing system, told law enforcement agents to move `` as rapidly as possible'' to get the facts on the case, said his spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> And President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the allegations, if correct, showed people `` stealing from our national defense and undermining our national security.'' Although the investigation had been under way since September 1986, it was not made public until mid-June when the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> issued search warrants at 38 locations and 12 states. Investigators used court-ordered wiretaps to gather much of their information. At least 20 defense contractors are under investigation, as well as six <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials and a number of consultants, among them <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, former assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for research, engineering and systems. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> has said no congressmen were targets of the investigation, although Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, D-Md., and former Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., were once described as being under No search warrants or subpoenas were issued to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or their staffs. Shortly after the investigation was revealed, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> reassigned the six <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials under scrutiny. Then, based on information he received from court papers, he suspended payment on $ 1 billion worth of potentially tainted military contracts. The investigation has prompted calls in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to overhaul and procurement system at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, which lets contracts worth $ 620 million daily. The first indictment named <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, three of its employees, two private consultants and a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> procurement specialist. They will be arraigned Friday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> could be fined up to $ 6.5 million if convicted. At the heart of the indictment are charges that <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> and its officers agreed to pay consultant <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> $ 160,000 to assist them in obtaining a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contract worth $ 100 million. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> paid <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>, a California-based private consultant, who gave money to <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> procurement official, for his assistance in manipulating the procurement process, the indictment says. If convicted of all charges, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> could face maximum penalties of 185 years in prison and fines of $ 5.5 million each, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said.

Two former <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> employees and a <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electonics </ORGANIZATION> employee also pleaded guilty to lesser charges. They, too, are cooperating with the government. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said it is reviewing the guilty pleas and the indictments to see what action should be taken.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s doctors surgically corrected a curvature of his left ring finger on Saturday and he was described as being `` in good spirits'' after the 2 -LCB- - hour operation `` The president is comfortable and completed the operation with flying colors,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s doctor, Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, said in a statement released by the White House. The operation was designed to alleviate a rather common but deforming condition known as <PERSON> Dupuytren </PERSON>'s Contracture. It caused the president's finger to curve inward. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s arm will be in a sling and his hand bandaged for several days. He he will receive no special medication `` other than routine post-operative antibiotics and analgesics,'' the statement said. `` It is anticipated that the president will have full use of his finger,'' the statement added. <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was `` alert and responsive'' throughout the surgery, which began at 8:24 a.m. EST and was `` sucessfully completed'' around 11 a.m. EST. `` His overall health is excellent,'' the physician said. `` He's in good spirits,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said following the surgery. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> returned to his hospital room shortly after the procedure and was visited by his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, the spokesman said. `` Today's procedure is not expected to interrupt the president's normal work schedule,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> chatted with the team of physicians throughout the procedure, talking about horses and his upcoming return to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> returns to his home state on Jan. 20 after president-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is inaugurated. <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> reported that the president's doctors began administering local anesthesia shortly after 7:30 a.m. to numb his arm and hand. The procedure was conducted by a team of physicians at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s operation consisted of a `` partial palmer and digital fasciectomy. The disease extended from the wrist to the tip of the ring finger.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> explained that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s finger was cut from his palm to the tip of his finger and that the diseased tissue was removed in order to allow the finger to move freely. The affliction causes the progressive, and usually painless, contraction of the fingers and is due to a thickening of the tissue called fascia in the palm of the hand. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neviaser </PERSON>, chairman of the orthopedic surgery department and director of the hand surgery service at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Dupuytren </PERSON>'s Contraction is a fairly common problem in men of Irish or Scottish ancestry. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is a descendent of <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> immigrants. <PERSON> Neviaser </PERSON> said doctors do not know exactly what causes the affliction, which consists of `` a cellular activity that changes the fascia, causing formation of bands and nodules. The skin becomes thin over the fascia and the contraction of the fingers start.'' To relieve the contraction, <PERSON> Neviaser </PERSON> said surgeons make an incision over the area in the <LOCATION> palm </LOCATION> where a band of tissue has formed. The fascia is carefully separated from the skin and removed. The incision in the skin then is stitched back together. <PERSON> Neviaser </PERSON>, who is not involved in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s operation, said only the tissue directly involved with the finger contraction is removed. Although the procedure to remove the diseased tissue is considered minor surgery and patients usually do not remain overnight in the hospital, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was to stay at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> until Sunday as a precaution, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The first lady was expected to stay overnight at the White House but to go to the hospital to accompany her husband home. Upon entering the hospital just before noon, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> nodded `` yes'' when asked if she had spoken with the president by telephone, flashed a thumbs-up signal and said he was `` fine.'' The contracture was minimal when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981 but progressed enough during the past year to require surgical treatment. Untreated, the condition eventually may involve all four fingers but the thumb, leaving the hand in a clenched, claw-like position. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> did not expect any further surgery to be necessary. After several days, the spokesman said, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s splint will be removed and he will only be required to wear a hand bandage. He will wear a so-called `` dynamic'' splint for several months. It is a splint that allows the finger to flex so that the muscles can be strengthened, the spokesman said. <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> said the physicians involved, besides himself, included Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogumill </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a consultant at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION>; Col. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and Maj. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlik </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Hand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION>. The anesthesiologist was Lt. Col <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandy </PERSON>. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> medical unit and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> took part as consultants, <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>New Year Brings Integration, Ending 36-Year-Old Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENSBURG, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Black and white students are in the same public schools for the first time in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, after officials settled a 36-year-old integration lawsuit, the nation's oldest `` The biggest problem has been kids not finding their classrooms,'' said <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizell </PERSON>, one of two administrators sharing responsibility for the new consolidated high school, after classes began Friday. `` It's working smoother than anybody thought it would,'' agreed <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the other co-supervisor. <PERSON> Mizell </PERSON> was principal at all-white <ORGANIZATION> Greensburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was principal at <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION>, a predominantly black school. Although <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION>'s high school students all are going to class in what used to be <LOCATION> Greensburg </LOCATION> High, it will be next fall before their classes are integrated, officials said. For this semester, they have the same classmates and teachers they had when the year began. Friday was the first day of class under an integration plan proposed by the school board and approved Dec. 22 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> made his ruling settling the nation's oldest pending desegregation lawsuit after two days of hearings, during which white parents demonstration against consolidation and black parents demonstrated for it. `` There is no question the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has been operating in violation of the Constitution of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said in his ruling. `` The board now has come with its own proposal to consolidate all schools in the parish and this means desegregation will be accomplished. `` In some areas, these schools are not fit for a doghouse,'' the judge added. The suit was filed in 1952 by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, whose 14 children all attended black schools, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. That was even before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s landmark ruling in the case of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> vs. the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, that ruled that segregated schools are inherently unequal. About 70 percent of the 2,040 children now in public school are black, although the parish population is about 51 percent black. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> is northeast of <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, the state capital. The school board, saying it could no longer afford segregated schools, combined seven schools into three _ one for kindergarten through fourth-grade students, one for grades 5-8 and the high school. `` Most of the adjustments are at the elementary school,'' said <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spears </PERSON>, the parish's first black superintendent of schools and one of only three black superintendents among <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s 64 parish -LRB- county -RRB- and two city school systems. The elementary level also was where most of the obvious problems were. Kindergarten and the first four grades were consolidated at what had been <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> _ a predominantly black school. Three other elementary schools were closed, two for blacks and one for whites. `` Why could n't they have waited? I went into two classrooms and neither have lights. They have wires all over,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>, whose second - and fourth-grade sons had attended a closed white school Kindergarten teacher <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chadwick </PERSON>, who came from a closed school, said her new classroom had no heat, one of her two windows would n't open, there were no electrical outlets, painting was incomplete, clothes racks were n't up, floors had n't been cleaned and the play area was so full of cars that recess was canceled <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> said all of the parish's schools are substandard, but the four closed schools were the worst. `` I think today is excellent for a start, and I expect to see changes of attitudes in the next couple of days,'' the superintendent said. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Self </PERSON>, a senior who had attended predominately black St. Helena High, said there had n't been any conflicts. `` I play basketball and that'll work out once we get to know each other _ when we learn each other's moves,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radio address Saturday: My fellow Americans, on Monday I submit to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> my final budget. It's a responsible plan which cuts the deficit without touching Social Security, weakening defense, or reducing benefits to the needy. And the best news is that this budget proves it can be done without raising your taxes. Our growing economy will, in the next fiscal year, produce $ 84 billion in new revenues with no increase in tax rates. Since the whole economic pie is expanding, the federal government's slice grows along with the private sector. Raising taxes would be the surest way to kill the economic goose that lays the golden eggs. So I leave as I came, dead-set against any new taxes. And even if there were a tax increase, history shows that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would almost certainly spend the additional money, it could n't be used to reduce the deficit. It would just mean that you had to pay for an even bigger government. And now, with an estimated $ 84 billion new revenues coming in, we can both reduce the deficit and increase federal spending. By combining new revenues with previously scheduled reductions and savings in other areas, priority programs will grow by nearly $ 50 billion. There are more funds for air safety, fighting crime, housing the poor, and the war on drugs. Funds for AIDS research and prevention is increased by 24 percent. And money to clean up toxic waste goes up by a fifth. We also increase funds for the science and space program, and for basic biomedical research. And student aid funds are increased again, bringing it to a level 83 percent higher than where it stood in 1980. Real defense spending is increased by 2 percent. This is a small increase, but an important one _ the price of peace and security for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Through strength we achieved greater realism in the U.S.-Soviet relationship and breakthroughs in arms reduction. Our defense budget will enable us to continue on this path. Let's remember that despite the internal reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, they are modernizing their weapons at a rapid pace, spending a far larger share of Gross National Product on weapons than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does Spending on Medicare and Medicaid will increase by $ 10 billion in the next fiscal year. But, if the past is any guide, the headlines will claim we've actually cut funding. Well, `` t ` ai n't so In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, when spending goes up less than had been projected, they call that a `` cut,'' even though more of your tax dollars are being spent than ever before. With Medicare, we've simply limited the increase in payments to providers of services. There is no effect on the people who receive the benefits. So, my fiscal year 1990 budget provides for the needy, does not raise taxes; and, by controlling the growth in spending, reduces the deficit next year by nearly $ 70 billion. This not only meets the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction target, it reduces the deficit even further and puts us on track to a balanced budget and a modest surplus by fiscal year 1993. This budget is a realistic program which protects the working families of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, provides adequate support for those who depend on government, and helps assure <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s prosperity in the years to come. I've often spoken of the rising income Americans have enjoyed in recent years, but one group lags behind. According to a new report by the <ORGANIZATION> Bipartisan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salaries </ORGANIZATION>, real pay for top level government jobs has fallen by 35 percent since 1969 due to inflation, while private sector pay has outpaced inflation. So, my budget includes higher pay for vital positions ranging from judges to scientists to elected officials. This increase is still less than what was lost to inflation. Even after this raise, the real income of a <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge will be 19 percent less than in 1969. The cost of these increases will be absorbed in the budget without slowing progress in the deficit, and we'll be getting something important in return. When salaries are too low, it's hard to attract and keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best in government. Federal judges are leaving the bench in record numbers, partly because they're paid less than junior members of law firms. The National Institutes of Health that fight cancer and other grave diseases have vacancies for senior researchers that have been empty for 10 years, due to poor pay. Also troubling is that some officials, particularly in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, now supplement their income with special interest honoraria payments. My support for the pay increase rests on my firm belief that such payments undermine the integrity of our government and should be abolished. We must be willing to pay for excellence in government, or risk a government run only by people of wealth, or by those beholden to special interests. Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

<HEAD>Four Die in Battles between Rival Shiite Militiamen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Four fighters were killed and 12 civilians wounded in battles Saturday between rival Shiite Moslem militias in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s bomb-scarred commercial district and south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, a police spokesman said. An uneasy calm prevailed Saturday afternoon following the clashes between the pro-Syrian Amal, which means Hope, and Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. Three fighters were killed and eight people wounded in fierce <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> street battles, said the spokesman who can not be named under police rules. The two groups also dueled with howitzers and mortars 30 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, killing one combatant and wounding four people, he said. The new casualties brought the casualty toll to 33 killed and 92 wounded the Dec. 31 outbreak of the latest round of violence between the rival militias. Shell explosions accompanied by staccato bursts of machine-gun fire echoed across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> through the night as <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militiamen launched hit-and-run attacks on <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> positions near the western edge of the civil war Green Line that divides the capital into Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, according to the spokesman, responded by shelling Amal-controlled districts of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to `` ease the pressure on its fighters.'' Syrian troops armed with AK-47 assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers moved into the disputed area before dawn and enforced a cease-fire, the spokesman said. In south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Iklim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Tiffah </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>, Amal gunners shelled <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters with howitzers in the villages of <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jarjou </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleem </PERSON>, <PERSON> Louwaizeh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouswar </PERSON> on the northwestern edge of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone. The police spokesman said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> answered by shelling Amal's supply lines `` No change of positions was reported in the region. The fighting died down early in the morning,'' he said. The Dec. 31 clash shattered a Syrian-brokered cease-fire. The Nov. 27 cease-fire ended six days of <ORGANIZATION> Amal-Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighting in which 40 people were killed and 87 wounded. For more than nine months, the two factions have been fighting for dominance of the 1 million Shiites who make up <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s largest sect. <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> flushed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> out of most of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in a four-day crackdown in April that killed 62 people and wounded 150. The militias fought a fierce 22-day battle in the slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in May, killing 286 people and wounding 972 by police count. That confrontation also ended with <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> intervention.

 Here is the text of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radio address Saturday, given by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>: Good afternoon. This is <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. In 13 days, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will complete his eight years as our nation's chief executive. I know I speak for all Americans in wishing for Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the blessings of health and happiness, as much rest as he wants and as much work as he wants, and a full and productive life in his retirement. For President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, all of us wish success in his mighty endeavor _ the strength, the vision, courage and ability required in that most important office on Earth, and the finest blessings of God. Let us work as Americans to begin the new year in a cooperative spirit. In a nation where free men and women think for themselves, unanimity is never possible; it probably is n't even desirable. But when we let the larger things that unite us transcend the lesser concerns that divide us, our nation can achieve the basic unity essential in dealing with foreign countries. As a spokesman for the loyal opposition and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, one who has often disagreed with the domestic priorities of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, I want to express thanks as an American to this administration for improving relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, for helping to abate the crisis in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and for encouraging the growth and sustenance of political freedom in countries throughout the world. In most areas of our foreign policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration have worked together. The only exceptions were how to deal with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. During the new administration, I earnestly hope that we will be able to achieve true bipartisanship in every area of our foreign policy, and I pledge to President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the unstinting cooperation of the congressional leadership in seeking that end. On the domestic front, our nation struggles to overcome three deficits: the budget deficit, the trade deficit, and the social deficit, caused by the growing difficulty for average Americans in trying to pay for such basic necessities as housing, higher education and health care. Now we can not expect to vanquish those evils entirely in this coming year. But if we have the will, we can make significant progress against all three deficits. Both of our political parties are publicly committed to doing so. By working together, we can help our new president fulfill his announced promise of a `` kinder, gentler'' <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership are eager to help him attain his announced goals of wider access for all Americans to education, to child care, to affordable housing, and to a cleaner environment. Working together, we can remove the scourge of drugs from our streets and from our schools. We have made significant progress in this bipartisan goal. Let us work together now for full funding to make our pledge a reality. Working together, we can pass a clean air bill this year. Let's make that one of our objectives. By working together, we can clean up the murky areas of campaign financing, broaden the base of small individual contributors and reduce the influence of special interests. This deserves our commitment, and I now invite a joint commitment. By working together, we can steadily reduce and eventually eliminate the annual budget deficits that threaten our economic future. Both Democrats and Republicans made contributions last year to landmark trade legislation. Let us not abandon that effort until <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> attains the objective of a revived industrial base. This is going to be a very busy and productive year in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. I am determined that as far as the speaker can influence the schedule, we're going to perform our work on time. As we did last year, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will pass all of our regular appropriations bills before the beginning of the August recess. Now we in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hope that the next administration, together with us, will usher in a new era of cooperation and good feelings between the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> and Executive branches of government. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> faces daunting challenges, but by working together, we can assure that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future will shine just as brightly as our past. Thank you for listening, and good afternoon.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> urged more than 140 nations Saturday to keep chemical weapons technology out of terrorists' hands, and he took steps to smooth relations with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over a <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> plant said to be developing poison gas. Addressing delegates at <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> lamented `` the dangerous spread and resurgent use of one of humanity's most dreaded and dreadful forms of warfare.'' He urged the imposition of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sanctions against countries violating the 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Protocol banning use of chemical weapons. He said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general should be armed with broad powers to investigate allegations of chemical weapons use in wartime. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the past quarter century has seen the erosion of `` international norms'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. This, he said, was `` a dangerous step backwards for mankind, for reason, for civilization.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did not single out any country by name, but it was clear <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was one of his targets. `` Some governments, which have been known to sponsor terrorism now have sizable chemical weapons capabilities,'' he said. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is on the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s list of nations sponsoring terrorism. Despite a tacit ground rule against name calling at the conference, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> made a vitriolic attack on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for using chemical weapons in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> demanded to know whether <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would be cited in the conference's final communique. The war, the most recent verified use of chemical arms, was obliquely referred to by other speakers. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> reminded delegates that `` high quality'' discussion was needed for a successful congress. Outside the conference hall, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made arrangements with West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to present evidence in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> supporting allegations that West German firms are involved in building a plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> that will produce chemical weapons. `` We will do everything in our power to prevent German nationals and German companies from cooperating in a foreign country in chemical weapons production,'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has insisted there is no hard evidence of German involvement in the plant at <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says will produce pharmaceuticals. A spokesman for Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> complained Friday of a `` campaign in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media'' against <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he was certain the West Germans were approaching the problem with `` great seriousness'' and `` if they find there is a need for adjustments in their legal framework, they will do that.'' He referred to export controls on technology transfers that some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said failed to keep sensitive technology out of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s hands. The five-day conference at the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization is aimed at giving renewed political impetus to negotiations that have been going on nearly two decades in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Negotiators are seeking a convention banning the development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical arms. `` The time has come to take concerted political action at a high level,'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told the conference. `` All nations large and small have an equal interest in working for a world without chemical weapons.'' The deliberations were delayed for a minute's silent tribute to Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, whose 62-year reign ended with his death Saturday at age 87. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dispute with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> plant tended to overshadow the gathering of foreign ministers and ambassadors from more than 140 nations. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, on his arrival Friday, said, `` Without proof, no government has the right to present such accusations'' as those the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has made against <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. He also complained that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of two Libyan planes over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> on Wednesday `` poisons the atmosphere'' for the conference. In his speech, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said terrorists' access to chemical and biological weapons poses a growing threat to the world. He urged delegates `` to join me in committing our governments not only to prevent the use of chemical weapons in armed conflict, but also to prevent the spread of chemical weapons to terrorist groups.'' He renewed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pledge to observe the 1925 protocol, signed by 118 countries, and said nations possessing chemical weapons should join in `` preventing these weapons from spreading and being used ...'' Only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have acknowledged manufacturing and storing arsenals of chemical weapons. President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has vowed to seek an international ban on production provided it can be verified. The Soviets two years ago announced sharp reductions in their stockpiles. Officials stress that the conference's final communique, to be issued Wednesday, is political in nature, and that binding agreements must come from <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> are due to resume next month at a 40-nation disarmament conference.

<HEAD>Vietnam Hails Withdrawal Of Its Troops from Cambodia</HEAD>

 Ten years after its forces marched into <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on Saturday hailed the planned withdrawal of its remaining 50,000 troops. The Vietnamese <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <PERSON> Nhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> praised the pullout as `` a convincing proof of the steady growth of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> Kampuchea </LOCATION>,'' or <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s government was installed Jan. 7, 1979, when <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s troops ousted the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from power In a speech Friday marking his government's decade in power, President <PERSON> Heng </PERSON> <PERSON> Samrin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> announced <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> would withdraw all its remaining forces by September if a political settlement to the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> war is reached. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has repeatedly pledged to withdraw the troops earlier than its original target date of 1990, but it had not previously set a date. The Vietnamese newspaper said the decision, made jointly by the two countries, is a `` new testimony to good will and determination to achieve an equitable solution.'' The anniversary celebrations began Friday with speeches by <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> and Vietnamese leaders. In <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, public buildings had been painted and streets swept clean. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON>, general secretary of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday the total withdrawal `` must be undertaken simultaneously with the cessation of foreign military aid to all Cambodian sides and of the use of foreign territory as sanctuary against the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Heng </PERSON> <PERSON> Samrin </PERSON> said his government hopes other countries will keep promises to end aid and sanctuary to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and two other non-communist guerrilla groups. Such promises have been made by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which arms the guerrillas, and by <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, which gives them territory for bases. `` These agreements must be carried out under effective international supervision,'' the president said. Resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> was quoted as saying, however, that Vietnamese pledges of withdrawals are false, that peace talks have failed and that <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s future can be settled only by continued fighting. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s announced intention to withdraw its troops has raised fears that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the most powerful of the resistance groups, would seize power again. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which initially had an estimated 200,000 troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, claims to have made annual withdrawals since 1982. It says the largest came in 1988, when all advisers and 50,000 soldiers returned home.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> takes his last shot at ordering national priorities when he sends <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> his final budget, a $ 1.15 trillion spending plan that purports to cut the federal deficit to the lowest level of his administration while keeping taxes at their present level. Sounding many of the president's favorite conservative themes, the budget being laid out Monday will propose eliminating 82 government programs while protecting his defense buildup and recommending a big increase in spending for the space-based nuclear shield known as Star Wars. `` I leave as I came _ dead set against any new taxes,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Saturday in his weekly radio address. `` It's a responsible plan which cuts the deficit without touching Social Security, weakening defense, or reducing benfits to the needy,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` And the best news is that this budget proves it can be done without raising your taxes. Raising taxes would be the surest way to kill the economic goose that lays the golden eggs,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The budget also will address two of the government's most pressing problems: the costly bailout of the savings and loan industry and the cleanup of contaminated nuclear weapons production facilities. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budgets often have been declared dead on arrival by skeptical members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the new document is being branded as even more irrelevant since President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can rewrite the whole thing if he chooses to after he takes office Jan. 20. `` I think we'll pay very little attention to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget and really focus on what's coming from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Tenn </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget director, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, insists the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget will serve as an excellent starting point for the new administration. Many Republicans on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> agree. `` It will be a tough, classic <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It proves that even with an increase in defense you can reach the deficit targets without higher taxes.'' Like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> does not favor any new taxes and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget leaves Social Security untouched, something <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has pledged to do. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget for fiscal 1990, which begins next Oct. 1, calls for a deficit of $ 92.5 billion. If that projection holds true, it would be the smallest deficit of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era. The deficit was $ 73.7 billion in fiscal 1981, but that figure resulted from policies put in place by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. In fiscal 1982, the first budget year for which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> bore responsibility, the deficit rose to $ 127.9 billion and has been higher than that in each subsequent year. Technically, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> also submitted the 1982 budget before he left office in January of 1981, but it was the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that dealt with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in shaping the final 1982 spending plan. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has called the string of deficits, which hit a record of $ 221 billion in 1986, his biggest disappointment while in office. In a speech last month, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the deficits, which have almost tripled the national debt during his presidency, were the fault of an `` iron triangle.'' This alliance among <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the news media and special interest groups frustrated his attempts to bring spending under control, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Sources who spoke on condition they not be identified by name said the final <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget will seek to abolish the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, reduce subsidies for the <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> railroad passenger service and `` privatize'' some of the regional power authorities, all ideas <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has pushed without success for years. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said none of the more than 80 program eliminations being sought will surprise anyone. `` We have talked about eliminating these programs for eight years and have not been able to do it,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also will seek to save about $ 5 billion by slowing the growth of Medicare, the program that provides health care for 33 million elderly and disabled Social Security recipients. The reductions would not mean higher out-of-pocket costs for patients but would come from reducing payments to doctors and hospitals. In addition, the administration is seeking savings of $ 1.1 billion in the Medicaid program which pays the health costs of poor people. Some areas will be in line for spending increases under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will propose boosting defense spending authority to $ 306 billion, representing a 2 percent increase over the rate of inflation, something that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are likely to scale back. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposal will seek about a 50 percent increase in spending on the Star Wars nuclear shield. Also in line for spending increases will be AIDS research, modernization of the nation's air control system and more funds for orbiting a manned space station. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will seek a $ 900 million increase in cleanup and upgrading of the nation's nuclear arms plants and will propose spending around $ 10 billion in 1990 on the cost of closing or merging hundreds of failed savings and loan institutions. The budget also will call for a 50 percent pay increase for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and other top federal officials. If current government programs underwent no changes except to take the cost of inflation into account, the federal deficit would be $ 127 billion in 1990, the administration estimates. The deficit for the current fiscal year is projected to be $ 155 billion, the same as the deficit in the 1988 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30. The administration's projected $ 92.5 billion deficit would more than meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit target of $ 100 billion for 1990. The law sets deficit targets for each year leading to a balanced budget in 1993. In addition to spending cuts, the budget proposes to raise $ 6 billion from the sale of government assets, including two naval petroleum reserves and a package of government loans held by the public. The administration's projection of meeting the Gramm-Rudman deficit target depends on a set of economic assumptions that many private economists consider too optimistic. `` I think <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s final budget is going to give us <PERSON> Rosy </PERSON> <PERSON> Scenario </PERSON>'s older sister _ Pie in the Sky,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Best </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> Watch, a non-partisan group that monitors the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. By contrast, the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> is predicting the deficit in 1990 will hit $ 141 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> expects the economy, as measured by the gross national product, will expand 2.9 percent this year, compared to an administration forecast of 3.2 percent economic growth. The difference in economic assumptions is even greater in the years beyond 1990 with the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> projecting sluggish growth of around 2.2 percent each year through 1994, a full percentage point below the administration's assumptions. Where the administration sees the budget deficit shrinking to only $ 9 billion by 1994, even without any spending cuts or tax increases, the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> forecast, reflecting its slower growth estimates, puts the deficit that year at $ 122 billion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to adopt the administration's economic projections when he submits his own spending proposals to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in two or three weeks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he will set forth his ideas of attacking the budget deficit at a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> shortly after he takes office Jan. 20.

 Troops shot and wounded 14 Palestinians on Saturday in the occupied lands, including a teen-age girl shot in the head and critically wounded during a clash in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and hospital officials said. Hospital officials also reported that assailants stabbed to death an Arab village leader suspected of collaborating with the Israelis. But a military spokesman linked the slaying to rivalries between Arabs. Protests erupted Saturday in the area of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, where troops shot and wounded four protesters, including the 16-year-old girl, hospital officials said In another incident in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, dozens of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> women held an illegal march and raised <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, an Arab reporter said. He said soldiers forced the women to disperse without opening fire. Two protesters were shot and wounded in a clash in <PERSON> Bani </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>, a village in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, troops shot and wounded at least eight protesters who hurled rocks at them in the town of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> and at two refugee camps. Among the wounded was a 7-year-old boy, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and hospital officials said. A military spokesman said three Arabs were wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, but he gave no other details. The village leader, <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamoudah </PERSON>, was stabbed to death late Friday when an angry mob attacked his home in <LOCATION> Qubeiba </LOCATION>, seven miles northwest of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, acccordign to <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hamoudah </PERSON>'s two sons, both in their 20s, were injured in the attack, the report said. <PERSON> Hamoudah </PERSON>, 57, died Friday in a <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> hospital, hospital officials said. A military spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said <PERSON> Hamoudah </PERSON>'s death was connected to rivalries between Arab clans. <PERSON> Hamoudah </PERSON> was the mukhtar, or traditional leader of <LOCATION> Qubeiba </LOCATION>. More than a dozen Palestinian collaborators have been killed by fellow Arabs during the nearly 13-month-long Palestinian uprising. Last week, death threats were made against the mayor of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>, for proposing a cease-fire in the uprising that has claimed the lives of 347 Palestinians and 14 Israelis. Also last week, a 25-year-old man from Jerico suspected of cooperating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was slain in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Pro-Syrian Palestinian factions have been calling for the elimination of the traditional leadership in the occupied territories to make way for more radical leaders, according to reports in Palestinian newspapers.

<DATELINE>ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Troops backed by helicopter gunships Saturday stormed a military garrison held by dissident police officers, ending a three-day standoff in which a general and 16 others were killed. Military officials said they believed all the dissident officers were killed when troops attacked the Philippine Constabulary regional headquarters in <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION>, about 500 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Soldiers secured the camp Saturday afternoon after nearly 24 hours of sporadic fighting with the gunmen holed up inside, according to Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON>, the country's military chief of staff. The seaside garrison was seized Thursday by eight police officers who had been fired from their jobs and ordered held in connection with a murder investigation. The eight, along with about five of their supporters, took hostage the garrison commander and his chief of staff. On Friday, scores of armed men, some of whom may have been soldiers, slipped into the headquarters building to join the captors, officials said. Troops stormed the garrison Friday but withdrew under heavy fire. On Saturday, the soldiers fired rifles and automatic weapons at the headquarters and nearby buildings held by the dissidents. Troops began their final assault after two military helicopters strafed the compound with machine guns and another helicopter fired four rockets, setting the two-story headquarters building on fire. Armored personnel carriers provided cover fire as soldiers swept through the compound, using tear gas to flush out snipers. Since the fighting began Thursday, eight soldiers and two civilians have been wounded, officials said. The police officers had demanded to be flown to <LOCATION> Siasi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 125 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION>. Officials offered to fly them to another island if they could prove one of the hostages, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Batalla </PERSON>, was alive. Officials launched an attack on the garrison after they learned that <PERSON> Batalla </PERSON> and the second hostage, Col. <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Abendan </PERSON>, had been slain by the captors. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said 16 bodies, many mutilated and burned beyond recognition, were found in the headquarters building and around the mosque. He said the bodies of <LOCATION> Batalla </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Abendan </PERSON> were tentatively identified. The eight police officers, led by <PERSON> Patrolman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizal </PERSON> <PERSON> Alih </PERSON>, took the general hostage after he dismissed them from the police force and ordered them held for an investigation into the 1984 killing of seven people, authorities said. <PERSON> Alih </PERSON> had been charged in the November 1984 slaying of Mayor <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION> but was acquitted. Three weeks after <PERSON> Climaco </PERSON>'s death, seven people were killed in a raid on <PERSON> Alih </PERSON>'s home Last month, <PERSON> Batalla </PERSON> received permission to arrest <PERSON> Alih </PERSON> and the other police officers, all of whom faced possible charges of murder or conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the 1984 raid. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said investigators were uncertain whether <PERSON> Alih </PERSON>'s body had been found among those who died at the garrison. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacanando </PERSON>, the southern regional commander, said a 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew would be imposed for several days in <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION> to allow tension to ease and military reinforcements would be deployed.

 Under all the glitz at Saturday's opening of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Show </ORGANIZATION> are 700 cars and trucks showing that rounded shapes have taken charge and the rolling box is becoming a thing of the past. `` It's obvious that everyone is hitting the aerodynamics heavy,'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> of <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> said looking over the displays at the show, which runs through Jan. 15. `` Just look at the Cadillacs,'' said <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>, who added he prefers Fords. `` They're starting to soften the lines even on the big ones. They are n't bulky boxes anymore.'' Automakers talk a lot about performance, suspension and safety, but most American car shoppers look for other things, said analyst <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` People buy cars for three reasons: price, looks and reliability,'' he said. And appearance is what an auto show is all about. There are no test drives and some of the cars ca n't even be touched. There are new versions of old cars, like the Oldsmobile Cutlass series, and completely new cars, like the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar. There are traditional luxury cars, like <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>. And there are high-powered sports cars, like <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> and a new Corvette. There are two new imported luxury car lines at the show _ <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s Lexus and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s Infiniti _ which wo n't be in showrooms until next fall. A common thread is exterior design. The lines between the roofs and windshields and doors are barely noticeable. Rear windows flow smoothly into trunk lids, and redesigned under-door panels add to a sleeker appearance. Smooth design also moved into the popular minivan segment, in <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s new line of plastic-body, all-purpose vehicles for 1990, including the <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sport </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silhouette </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Chevrolet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumina </LOCATION>. `` I think that they are going to be dynamite vehicles,'' <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> said. `` There are a lot of advantages to having a plastic body _ you do n't have a rust problem and it resists minor dings. `` And some people just want to have something new-looking,'' he added. `` Will an Oldsmobile buyer like it? That's a pretty traditional buyer,'' <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> said. `` But I tell you, the <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> buyer will love it.'' While watching a white Trans Sport revolve slowly on a turntable at the show, <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Boily </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, said, `` It's definitely different `` It looks like a jet,'' she added, saying she and he fiance are looking seriously at minivans. The changes in design toward smoother cars is due in large part to changes in manufacturing and engineering technology, along with new materials. `` What's feasible to manufacturers continues to expand,'' said analyst <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Part of it is the -LRB- metal -RRB- stamping equipment,'' <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> said. `` In the golden age of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car design, we used thick steel with very generous curves. It did n't fit very well. `` We went to simpler dies and less handwork and thinner steel and that evolved into a boxier-looking car,'' he said. `` It's more sophisticated engineering, you have to have much more precise dies.'' Standing beside a maroon <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 200 at the show were <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Westland </LOCATION>. `` The first thing that strikes me about the car is the outside,'' <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> said. `` It's the silhouette,'' she added, `` I do n't like boxy cars.''

<TEXT>
 Women sang and men cheered Saturday after <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> upgraded the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission to an embassy and <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> hoisted the Palestinian flag over the building. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> also announced Saturday they would upgrade <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> missions to embassies. The actions were seen as bolstering the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman's <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace initiative and demand for an independent Palestinian state. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> waded through a crowd in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> to raise the black, red, white and green Palestinian banner in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> headquarters that will apparently serve as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> raised the Jordanian banner next to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> flag. Eight states, including <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, now have granted the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> embassies. About 70 countries have recognized the Palestinian state proclaimed in November by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament in exile The boundaries of the state sought for <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> have not been defined, but <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials say it would roughly encompass the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told reporters <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s decision to upgrade the embassy was `` true and strong support for the Palestinian cause, toward retrieving <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> so that we can raise these two flags on the walls of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> once again.'' He said no <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> had been named. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman as saying the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission would be upgraded there to strengthen friendly relations between the Chinese and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, long a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporter, is one of the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Arabs want the five to oversee Arab-Israeli peace talks at an international conference. <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said its decision to grant embassy status to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was due to the gulf state's desire to `` bolster the legitimate national rights of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people, especially their right to self-determination and establishing their independent state on their national soil.'' The clandestine leadership of the 13-month-old Palestinian uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Saturday issued a communique calling on European countries to upgrade <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> offices in their capitals and urging the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to recognize the Palestinian state. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has raised the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s status in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to that of `` general delegation'' _ a step short of diplomatic recognition. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> met with King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> on Saturday. <PERSON> Petra </PERSON>, the official <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> news agency, said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> expressed `` unlimited support for Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the Palestinian brethren and their just cause ... and support for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in every way until the Palestinian people achieve their goal'' of an independent homeland. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said discussions covered `` ways of reaching a fair and comprehensive peace'' with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and `` the importance of holding an Arab summit to extend support to the Palestinian position and advance the efforts of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> unity.''

<HEAD>Students, Parents Seek Swift End to Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Students and their parents increased pressure Saturday on the teachers union and the school board to end the city's first teachers strike. Several people picketed in front of the home of school superintendent <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ott </PERSON> on Saturday morning, urging the board and the union to resume negotiations which broke off Wednesday, when the strike began. The strike by 2,000 teachers, chiefly over salary and student discipline issues, has left some 34,000 students out of school. The teachers have worked without a contract since July 1. <PERSON> Ott </PERSON> was not home Saturday, but his wife, <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON>, said about 20 pickets gathered for a short time in front of their home. She said pickets carried signs that asked for negotiations to be resumed and the schools to be reopened. `` It's getting to where these people are saying ` a plague on both your houses,''' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>, a 17-year member of the school board and chairman of its finance committee. `` Some people are mad at the school board, some are mad at the union and a lot of them are fed up with both,'' he said. Students also picketed Friday outside school buildings and school board offices demanding a speedy resolution to the dispute. No formal talks were held Friday. Federal mediator <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorley </PERSON> said he hoped negotiations might resume Sunday. But <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trenta </PERSON>, a chief negotiator for the school board, said Saturday he had not heard of new talks. Union leaders met Saturday afternoon with the teachers in an <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> church to brief them on the status of the strike and were not immediately available for comment.

 A 17-year-old boy is being sought in the wounding of a 1-year-old child who was shot as his baby sitter was cruising for a drug buy, police said. An arrest warrant was issued Friday for <PERSON> Sedrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Latroy </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, the suspect in the Dec. 27 shooting of the baby, said Sgt. <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, a police spokesman.

<TEXT>
 Drivers trying to get their cars checked before an anti-smog crackdown begins say they have waited in line for hours and even days for the five-minute inspection. `` I've come four times so far,'' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> said heatedly as he got out of his battered white 1976 Rambler at one of the 32 governmen stations. `` Now I'm plain nervous.'' The government and environmentalists say <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s 3 million vehicles account for 80 percent of its pollution, which regularly exceeds maximum acceptable levels for ozone. Starting Monday, the city says cars visibly contaminating the air will be stopped. Fines equal to 20 days' minimum wage, or about $ 76, go into effect for violators Feb. 1, even if they have a sticker certifying their cars are smog-free. To obtain a sticker, a driver must pass muster at one of the inspection stations set up across the city. Inspections are free until Feb. 1. After that, they'll cost about $ 3.80 _ the equivalent of one day's mininum wage. <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> said Thursday he had waited from just after midnight until 4 p.m. and had yet to get his inspection. He said he came in at 4 a.m. another day and found too many already in line. At a larger station, drivers said they had been in line only 30 minutes, but longer waits seemed to be the rule. At a parking lot in the south part of the city, 160 cars were in line at 10 p.m. one night for the next day's scheduled 9 a.m. opening, already more than the station could handle in a day. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he was given a March 4 appointment at the La Viga station in south-central <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` I'd be in violation by then,'' he said. A few drivers said some stations were issuing stickers in exchange for bribes when cars failed the test. <PERSON> Adela </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said her car failed its first check, but the inspector tried to sell her a sticker for $ 17.50. She offered him $ 11, but he turned it down. Her car passed a later inspection. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, waiting in line with his'78 Dodge, said a similar thing happened to a friend who's a chauffer and took some company cars to a station. `` According to them, they were n't properly tuned and they charged 20,000 pesos -LRB- $ 8.75 -RRB- for the sticker,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said Newspaper reports said places in line were selling for up to 20,000 pesos. Responding to complaints, Mayor <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> on Friday urged citizens to report incidents of corruption to city officials. Taking action against pollution is good, `` but I'd like to see one of those buses come in here,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said, watching a yellow and brown city bus as it trailed a stream of black smoke from the pipe on its roof. The testing so far is required only of private vehicles, which account for 80 percent of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s vehicles. In 1987, private cars carried only 18 percnt of 25 million daily passenger trips, according to official figures. Subway, buses, trolleys, light trains and taxis provided the other transportation. At the parking lot where <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> was waiting, drivers had taken matters into their own hands. <PERSON> Vilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, a young volunteer, wrote license numbers on a waiting list for the first available appointment time, eight days later. She told drivers to come two days ahead to confirm the date and the next day to pick up a number. The plan included leaving cars in line overnight to assure their position. A guard was being paid about 45 cents apiece to watch them, but some drivers said they were staying anyway. Heated arguments resulted when newcomers tried to jump the line. <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> complained there was one mobile unit instead of two and it did n't open on time. `` There's nothing of what they have promised,'' he said. `` The people are obeying all the orders. Why do n't they do their part?''

 Sikh militants shot and killed 14 Hindus in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, apparently to avenge the execution of two Sikhs convicted in the assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, police said Saturday. At least three other people also were killed by suspected militants in the northern state Friday night. Three to four Sikhs carrying AK-47 rifles Friday raided four Hindu homes in <LOCATION> Badowal </LOCATION> village and shot down 10 people, said police superintendent <PERSON> Govind </PERSON> <PERSON> Ram </PERSON>. `` They separated the male members from others and shot them from point-blank range,'' he said in a telephone interview. One woman was injured in the firing when she tried to save her husband, he said. A note left by the killers said it was the first revenge killing for the hanging of <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who were hanged Friday. <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> said the note, written in <LOCATION> Punjabi </LOCATION>, threatened more killings. Badowal is 19 miles north of the Sikh holy city of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. In another attack, Sikh militants shot and killed four Hindus and injured two others at <PERSON> Sarai </PERSON> <PERSON> Amant </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> village Saturday, said police superintendent <PERSON> Suresh </PERSON> <PERSON> Arora </PERSON>. The village, 14 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, is close to the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border. Militants also were blamed for the killing of one Sikh, a Christian and an unidentified man in separate incidents in the state overnight. In other violence, a railway station was set ablaze and rockets were fired at a police patrol, police and news reports said. No casualties were reported. The killings bring to more than 50 the number of people killed in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> last week. In 1988, more than 2,400 people were killed in attacks blamed on the militants. Sikh militants fighting for an independent state since 1982 had threatened a wave of sectarian violence if <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> were executed. The government has placed tens of thousands of police and security forces on alert throughout northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, authorities said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday ordered the ashes of the executed Sikhs be immersed into a river under police supervision. It is an important religious rite for Hindus and Sikhs. The men were cremated at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s Tihar Jail after authorities refused to hand their bodies over to relatives. Sikhs make up only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people but they are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. They claim Sikhs are discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Hindu religious majority, which comprises 80 percent of the population. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was killed in November 1984 in apparent revenge for an army raid she had ordered on the Golden Temple in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine, in June 1984. The temple was being used as a base by the militants. Troops killed more than 1,200 people, mostly Sikhs, in the operation.

 Honky-tonk music knows no boundaries, according to musicians opposed to creation of a music district. Musicians in the audience of a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting last week applauded the establishment of a <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. But members of the <ORGANIZATION> Austin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Musicians </ORGANIZATION> expressed concern that the panel, charged with overseeing creation of a music district downtown, might only benefit business and real estate interests. Music-related businesses in the district could receive incentives such as the waiver of development fees and low-interest loans, said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, president of the 750-member federation. `` Trying to translate that into a benefit for the city's working professional musicians just kind of strains my credulity,'' said <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> `` Doc'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, a guitar player and music producer, said he does not think the commission will help local musicians. `` I do n't think the music district makes much sense. We've got areas all around town that are real active in music that are excluded'' from the district's boundaries, he said. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, owner of Concept Music, agreed. `` I think assigning it to a specific location is going to cut out an awful lot of people who could otherwise participate in it. I'm concerned that it's going to wind up being in the best interest of real estate owners and not musicians,'' he said Councilman <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, who proposed the commission, could not be immediately reached by telephone at his home or office.

 One month after <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s devastating earthquake, the foundation stone of a new apartment building was laid Saturday in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> to start reconstruction in the Armenian city. Authorities have pledged to rebuild within two years <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> and other Armenian towns and villages leveled in the Dec. 7 quake that killed tens of thousands of people. The quake destroyed about 200 apartment houses, factories and buildings in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> and left more than 500,000 people homeless. <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, home to about 280,000 people before the disaster, will be rebuilt with three - and four-story stone buildings that will be more comfortable and earthquake-resistant than those that crumbled, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Many of the buildings destroyed in the quake were nine-story apartment houses, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> has said a government commission will investigate whether building regulations were violated by the erection of such structures in a seismically active area. On Friday, the evening television news program `` Vremya'' showed workers using explosives to demolish five-story apartment buildings in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> that had not been toppled by the tremor but were too dangerous to inhabit. Workers on Saturday laid the first stone of an apartment building in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> that is to be part of a housing development, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent his `` sincere condolences'' and `` profound sympathy'' to the Japanese people. His two-sentence telegram made no mention of wartime hostilities with what still is known officially as `` militarist <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' The Kremlin currently is striving for better ties and increased trade with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> declared a three-day national state of mourning in honor of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s King Olav V announced a three-week court mourning. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> opened an international conference on chemical weapons with a minute of silence. But some reaction to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death was cool in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which endured years of harsh colonial rule by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. While President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> sent his condolences, a government party statement added, `` We reserve further comment, considering the unhappy past and the current Korea-Japan relationship.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> extended condolences and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> said it will send a delegation to the funeral. But <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s daily <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said: `` It was an irony that while <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> apologized to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for the war, he did not direct a single word to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to show his sorrow.'' Most historians believe <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was a powerless figurehead but had approved orders that led to the attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and put most of East Asia under an often brutal Japanese rule. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> called on his nation to surrender in 1945. The emperor's death drew mixed reaction in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, which lost more than 20,000 people under <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s wartime occupation of the former Dutch East Indies. The government said it sent its sympathy for `` the loss that has befallen the Japanese people,'' without mentioning the name of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, branded a war criminal by survivors of the wartime occupation of the colony that became <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> in 1949. `` To many war victims, only now has World War II finally come to an end,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Boekholt </PERSON>, chairman of the August 15 <ORGANIZATION> Commemoration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a group representing 127,000 Dutch citizens who underwent Japanese internment. `` Daily, they still feel the pain of the wartime suffering that was inflicted on them in the name of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Boekholt </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. But <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> cabled his condolences to Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s eldest son who immediately ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne, and said he will personally pay the last homage to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Moerdiono </PERSON> said. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> expressed his condolences and sent telegrams to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s family, <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> radio reported. Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> said she was saddened and Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she shares the Japanese people's sorrow. But opposition lawmakers said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> should boycott his funeral. `` No one should go to that funeral from this country,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a lawmaker of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who denounced <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> as `` a war criminal of the worst kind.'' `` It would be a grave insult to the many men and women ... imprisoned in slave camps,'' he said. `` Many of them died, but those who survived still suffer today.'' King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, King Faisal of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and other Persian Gulf monarchs, King <PERSON> Birendra </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmood </PERSON> <PERSON> Iskandar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> also sent condolences to <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> called <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> `` a superior symbol of the Japanese nation, its culture and its anxieties in a period of drastic transformations in the world and his country and in a time of grave new challenges in the world.''

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> on Saturday called for talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on defusing tensions and warned that military force `` does not pay _ especially with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.'' A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official brushed aside the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader's call but did not rule out the possibility of talks. Also Saturday, the government took three busloads of journalists to a plant that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government claims is intended to produce chemical weapons. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> said the plant at <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, produces pharmaceuticals. The reporters allowed only were to view the unlit building from the buses, which drove through the complex without stopping. Later Saturday, the government ordered visiting foreign journalists out of the country. However, journalists then were told they could stay until Sunday. It was unclear why the government issued the order and then apparently changed it. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, who had not been heard from or seen since Wednesday's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of two Libyan jet fighters, surprised about 200 foreign journalists at <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>'s waterfront Al Kabir Hotel Reporters and photographers scrambled over sofas, pushed over potted plants and took shortcuts across an ornamental fountain in the lobby to approach the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader as he entered. Some people were knocked to the ground. Patrons in a nearby coffee shop pressed against the window to catch a glimpse of <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> will not give in to the pressure of a superpower even if this confrontation lasts 1 million years,'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said, speaking softly in Arabic and surrounded by bodyguards. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must understand that her policy of surrounding us and using force against us will absolutely fail,'' he said. `` They must negotiate with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> directly and they should sit at the negotiating table with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> without their weapons to achieve peace in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>.'' Wednesday's incident occurred over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said two <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> jet fighters shot down two Libyan warplanes in self-defense. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> said its planes were unarmed. `` I think the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will be able to do this because they will have learned their lessons of the previous administration. There have been enough lessons. They will have learned that force does not pay, especially with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said. `` We will not respond to force, only to politeness and direct negotiations,'' he added. His comments were translated to English by an <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> aide. A senior <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official attending a chemical weapons conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> responded, `` Communications is not the problem, the problem is Libyan policy.'' But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, added, `` I am not ruling anything in or out.'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, whose country is represented at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> meeting, told reporters he would participate in efforts to ban chemical weapons as long as the campaign was aimed at all countries, not just <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The meeting is aimed at adding political impetus to a 1920 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Protocol outlawing use of chemical weapons. Pressed about the <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> plant, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said only: `` <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is opposing the use of chemical weapons.'' Journalists got only a fleeting view of the <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> plant. Two separate surface-to-air missile sites were nearby, as well as a radar station atop a barren ridge overlooking the highway. Tanks and an encampment of soldiers were also in the area. An unidentified Libyan official said the radar, soldiers and air defense batteries were put in place after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> threatened the plant last month. However, the radar station was a permanent facility on a concrete base, not a mobile unit. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has offered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a one-time inspection of the <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> plant, but the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said such a visit would be inadequate because the plant could quickly be modified to hide evidence of chemical weapon production. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> reported Saturday the <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> plant is geared more to the production of chemical weapons than to medicine because of its location, configuration and surrounding surface-to-air missiles. The plant is close to the <ORGANIZATION> Libyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which the paper said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> suspects is capable of producing or modifying heavy battlefield equipment as well as manufacturing weapons components and munitions. `` <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> will participate in all negotiations to get rid of all weapons from ordinary guns to nuclear bombs. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must get rid of its chemical and nuclear weapons factories and cancel the ` Star Wars' program,'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said, referring to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research for a space-based defense system. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was wrapped in a brown wool cape and wore a black wool pillbox hat to protect him from the rain. He smiled at cameras and with a handkerchief dabbed at the sweat that appeared on his face under the television lights. After <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> spoke, he took a quick stroll around the hotel, got back into his gray <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> and drove off.

<HEAD>Two Lawyers Ordered to Pay $12 Million for Mishandling Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A jury has ordered two lawyers to pay a total of $ 12 million in damages for mishandling a medical malpractice case. A <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury on Friday deliberated 45 minutes before finding former law partners <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dashiell </PERSON> negligent in the case brought by <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, whose 16-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Evon </PERSON>, died in October 1974 after minor surgery. The medical malpractice case, originally filed in 1977, was dismissed in 1980 for what a judge concluded was a lack of activity by the lawyers handling it. <PERSON> Dashiell </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, said his client would appeal. <PERSON> Dashiell </PERSON> has since joined another <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> law firm. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, who represented himself during the trial, had his legal license suspended indefinitely by the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in February 1986 for neglecting another client's case. According to <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Stokeses </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> admitted deceiving Mrs. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> in her daughter's case and told the jury he had planned to pay her by accumulating money through other cases. <PERSON> Evon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> died after surgery at <LOCATION> Lutheran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> to remove a cyst from the base of her spine, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. The surgery should have been minor, but the girl was given `` excessive doses'' of anesthesia and died shortly after being taken to the recovery room because hospital employees failed to properly monitor her heart rate, breathing and pulse, he said. The $ 12 million verdict is the largest legal malpractice award given by a jury in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. In May 1987, the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> firm of <LOCATION> Venable </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baetjer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> agreed to pay $ 27 million to settle a legal malpractice lawsuit filed by the state of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, but that sum was not awarded by a jury.

<HEAD>Flight Attendants Force Cancellation After Learning Of Sabotage Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Flight attendants forced the cancellation of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newark-to-Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> flight last week when they heard of a sabotage threat shortly before passengers boarded, authorities said Saturday. The seven members of Flight 49's cabin crew would not fly Tuesday night because the airline did not adequately explain the threat, said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeast </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION>, the crew's union. `` I think the flight attendants felt threatened,'' Ms. <PERSON> Yeast </PERSON> said Saturday. `` I just think it was an oversight on ... <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s part. It points to how important communication is in a situation like this.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had informed <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, received threats against Jan. 3 flights from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the airline said Saturday. No specific flight was identified, according to the airline. For most of the day Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> briefed crews leaving from <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> international airports in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> about safety precautions. But <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> officials apparently overlooked an information session with Flight 49's cabin crew, said Ms. Yeast. She said the flight attendants learned of the threat just minutes before passenger boarding was to begin. The plane, a DC-10 with 198 booked passengers, was scheduled to depart at 9:45 p.m. and was the last <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> flight out of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. `` I think the process tended to break down after people went home for the day,'' Ms. <PERSON> Yeast </PERSON> said, adding that airline officials continued to perform diligent baggage checks. <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Saturday from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that he could not comment on the crew briefing procedures for security reasons. `` We have an excellent security program ... part of that is not to discuss it publicly,'' <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> did not know how passengers were notified of the flight cancellation, but he said 138 of them were accommodated overnight at hotels and departed the following day. The plane, a DC-10 with 198 booked passengers, was scheduled to depart at 9:45 p.m. Airline industry officials said Saturday they did not expect more such cancellations, despite sensitivity to sabotage threats following the bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> more than two weeks ago. `` We do n't think that's an appropriate response on the part of the flight crew,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, spokesman for the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an industry trade group. `` We just think that airline management and the intelligence community are in a better position to make a threat assessment and to decide what the response should be,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Yeast </PERSON> said the union had confidence in security measures. `` I do n't think this is something that may be repeated'' by flight crews, she said. `` I do n't think that every flight attendant group goes through the situation ... is going to walk off. They were a victim of several circumstances.''

 Iranian authorities hanged 19 narcotics traffickers, some publicly, in an anti-drug drive in which more than 1,000 people were rounded up and dozens killed in shootouts, Iranian news reports said Saturday. There are no official estimates available, but officials have reported that drug abuse rose alarmingly during the 8-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s crackdown began after the Aug. 20 cease-fire. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said 10 smugglers were convicted of running drug trafficking networks, carrying illegal weapons, clashing with security forces, and possessing a total of 167 pounds of heroin and 1,166 pounds of opium. The agency said some were executed in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s Qasr prison and others publicly hanged in <LOCATION> Bani-Hashem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in the northwest suburbs. It did not say when. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said nine other convicted smugglers were hanged Friday and Saturday in other Iranian cities. These included <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> in the northwest, near the Afghan border, and <LOCATION> Kerman </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zahedan </LOCATION> in the southwest, a major smuggling route from neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> television on Saturday night showed interviews with some of the condemned men before their hangings. They were seated at what appeared to be school desks, and some tried to hide their faces from the camera. One was asked if he had known the penalty for his crime was death. `` I am an illiterate and did n't understand what was going on. My father did n't have anything, so I committed this act,'' he said. Another man, whose name also was not given, said he was a truck driver who was offered the equivalent of $ 12,000 to carry narcotics from a provincial town to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. `` I was tempted. It was purely materialistic,'' he said. The radio said several of the men executed were kingpins in major narcotics rings operating in the southwest, one of the main targets of the crackdown. A statement by the office of the Islamic Revolutionary Prosecutor in charge of the anti-narcotics campaign branded the executed men as `` the best examples of the corrupt on earth.'' The executions were carried out in advance of a tough new law that takes effect Jan. 21 under which the death sentence is mandatory for anyone caught carrying 30 grams -LRB- just more than 1 ounce -RRB- of heroin, morphine, codeine or methadone or smuggling more than 11 pounds of any narcotic. Any person who is found responsible for addicting another faces a minimum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. The Expediency Council, set up by revolutionary leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> in February to speed up legislation snarled in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s bureaucratic machine, announced the new law Dec. 5. In addition to the Persian Gulf War, other likely factors in the rise in drug smuggling and opium growing include a ban on alcohol, worsening unemployment and the breakdown of political control in the first years of the Islamic revolution.

 A 14-year-old boy who died of starvation despite his parents having nearly $ 4,000 in savings was buried Saturday before a handful of strangers. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON>'s family was unable to attend. They were in hospital beds, under treatment for malnutrition. His parents, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON>, have been charged with criminal homicide in the death. The boy died Tuesday night after the family had n't eaten for 42 days, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> told police. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON>, 39, said he did n't use $ 3,775 in cash, bonds and bank accounts to buy food because it was a tithe belonging to God, according to an affidavit filed by state police. <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON>, a former Seventh-day Adventist preacher, believed God would provide for his reclusive family, acquaintances said. The private, 10-minute graveside service was attended by nine people, said <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a Seventh-day Adventist pastor who conducted the service. He said his wife, a local funeral director and six pallbearers also attended and none of them knew the boy. The church paid for the boy's burial, he said. `` It's tragic that he was cut short in life _ that he did n't get to enjoy a full life,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> told him he wanted the service private and requested that relatives in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> not be present; <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said he did n't know how to contact them. The time and the location of the service were kept secret to try to keep away the media and others who wished to attend. `` A lot of members -LRB- of the congregation -RRB- wanted to go. Not out of curiosity, out of sympathy,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. A spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Geisinger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center-Wilkes-Barre </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> was in fair condition and <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> was in serious condition. Their daughter, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON>, 12, was listed in serious condition at <LOCATION> Mercy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>, whose dream was to become a meteorologist, was 5-foot-10 and weighed 69 pounds when he died, 80 pounds less than normal, <LOCATION> Luzerne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudock </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. His brief life was dominated by his family, neighbors and school officials said. He and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> scored extremely well on standardized tests, but since 1985 they were taught at home by their mother, <ORGANIZATION> Crestwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON>, who was fired in March from his job as a truck driver, said his savings represented 10 percent of his total earnings, according to the affidavit. Tithes, which are usually 10 percent, are used to pay the local pastor and for evangelical work, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, first elder at the Seventh-day Adventist church in <LOCATION> Slocum </LOCATION>, four miles from the <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON>'s home. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> said the Cottams had n't paid a tithe to the local church since they returned to the area in 1985. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said the Cottams had n't attended his church in <PERSON> Slocum </PERSON> in his 14 months as pastor. In 1983, <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> became an intern pastor, ministering to <PERSON> Slocum </PERSON> and three other nearby churches with a total congregation of about 250. He was stripped of his license to preach in 1985 because of strained relations with the congregations. Seventh-day Adventists are fundamentally evangelical and take the Bible as their sole rule of faith and practice. `` I think they -LRB- the Cottams -RRB- took the Lord and tested him to the extreme,'' said <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, a building contractor from nearby <PERSON> Dorrance </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cottam </PERSON> told a reporter Wednesday night he blamed himself, not God, for his son's death. He and his wife were arraigned separately Thursday night at Mercy Hospital. No bail was set, and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for Friday. In addition to criminal homicide, they face two counts each of recklessly endangering another person and endangering the welfare of children. Death is the maximum sentence for criminal homicide. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Loftus-Vergari </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Luzerne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said his agency was investigating whether the Cottams are able to properly care for their daughter.

<TEXT>
 The government on Saturday showed foreign journalists a plant the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration claims is preparing to produce chemical weapons, but the visit was a drive-by view on a moonless night. Thousands of civilians, including women and children, were camped nearby to `` protect'' the plant from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack, Libyan officials said. Soldiers, tanks and surface-to-air missiles guarded the site 60 miles southwest of the capital of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. Children in the village of <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> shook their fists and chanted anti-U.S. slogans at Western television cameras. The mysterious factory has been at the center of a conflict between <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that has threatened to escalate into military action. Fears of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack were heightened Wednesday when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes shot down two <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> fighters over the <LOCATION> Mediterrean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The government had promised the three busloads of reporters a tour of `` Pharma 150,'' which it claims makes medicine. However, officials refused to allow journalists out of the buses and into the building and did not drive close to the buildings until after nightfall. The buses came about 75 feet from the unlit plant buildings and did not stop. A short distance away, a radar station operated high atop a barren ridge overlooking the highway and two surface-to-air missile sites. Some tanks and an encampment of soldiers could be seen nearby. One unidentified Libyan official said the radar, soldiers and air defense batteries were put in place after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said last month that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was considering military action to destroy the plant. However, the radar installation was a permanent station on a concrete base, not a mobile unit. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON>, the man identified as manager of the factory, insisted it was a pharmaceutical plant and said no foreign contractors were involved. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has alleged that a West German company and other foreign firms helped build the complex. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has denied the allegations. One Libyan official said foreigners could not have an inside tour because well-known companies had been involved in the factory's construction and the firms did not want to be subject to sanctions The visit to the plant appeared designed to give reporters a chance to see the crowds that Libyan officials said were gathered along the road to `` protect'' the factory. A small tent city had been set up about 2 -LCB- miles from the plant, but it appeared too small to house the crowd of several thousand people in the area. A large number of cars and vans were parked along the road along with at least a dozen empty buses. `` We're standing up to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s call to attack,'' said <PERSON> Ahmir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> employee from <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> who said he was staying in the camp. `` The children and women here are brave too,'' he said. The crowd included women and children, people in white laboratory coats and men in blue jeans. Official Libyan media has said doctors and nurses have been holding a sit-in at the plant to protect it and protest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> threats. A Tripoli-based Western diplomat said in an interview Friday that <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> sent many people to the plant so that in case of an attack <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> could claim a civilian target had been hit, and women and children had been killed. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that the factory is geared more to producing chemical weapons than medicine because of its location, configuration, and protection by surface-to-air missiles. The paper quoted unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security sources as saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes the factory is designed to produce mustard gas and the nerve gas Sarin because of chemicals stockpiled there. Pharma 150 has been built close to the <ORGANIZATION> Libyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which the paper said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> suspects is capable of producing or modifying heavy battlefield equipment as well as manufacturing weapons components and munitions.

 Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was sworn in for his second term Saturday in a festive inauguration that marked the first time since 1901 that Republicans held the state's top two offices. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> was sworn in as the state's first Republican lieutenant governor elected this century. Also taking the oath of office were eight <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> officers. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 53, is the state's second governor this century to win successive terms. The first was Democrat <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>. In his inaugural address to about 7,000 people, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> outlined a policy agenda that included a career advancement plan for teachers and more highway funding. `` There are new challenges for us to face, along with unfinished business from the past,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. `` There is indeed a brighter future for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> affirmed his support for statewide implementation of the Career Ladder Program for teachers, a merit pay system he has pushed despite mixed reviews from educators and legislators. Sixteen school systems now use the program. The governor said he would establish task forces to study two of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s biggest problems: drug abuse and pollution. He also promised to support the recommendations of a legislative commission studying ways to finance a major highway construction program. But he endorsed no specific measures.

 Government water utility workers went on strike Saturday, threatening water shortages for at least 1 million people in the capital and in western <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. Five unions at the official <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, representing editorial and other workers, also began a seven-day strike. The latest strikes follow four days of violent street demonstrations and a general strike in late December against steep price increases. The protests ended after the financially strapped government rolled back prices. Workers at the the Sudanese <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> demanded better working conditions and wage increases for employees. The strike affected 245 water stations in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, most of them in the industrial northern area, and further aggravated water shortages suffered by residents in the mainly desert regions of <LOCATION> Darfur </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kordofan </LOCATION> in the west. Union leaders representing workers at the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> met with <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, the culture and information minister, but failed to head off the walkout. The unions voiced opposition to deteriorating professional standards and an alleged lack of leadership. In the past few months, powerful trade and professional unions have orchestrated strikes by teachers, communication technicians, <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> employees and civil aviation technicians and air controllers. The government says the unrest at the end of last month left one person dead and 26 injured, but Western sources say at least four died and more than 26 were hurt. The protests and general strike prompted Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s Cabinet on Dec. 29 to revoke commodity price increases of up to 500 percent and a 15 percent across-the-board sales tax. It also made retroactive to July 1 instead of Dec. 1, salary increases of 50 percent to 300 percent decreed a week before for all public and private employees. Since then, the government has been discussing with trade and professional unions ways to finance the salary increases.

 Another relative of ex-president <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> has been arrested in a widening corruption inquiry that has disgraced the former ruler and embarrassed his successor. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyu-seung </PERSON>, an uncle of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Soon-ja </PERSON>, was imprisoned Friday and charged with taking about $ 730,000 in bribes from a businessman for selling influence. Prosecutors and legislators are investigating allegations of corruption, human rights violations, and other abuses under <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his authoritarian rule. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, a former general who took power with military backing in 1980, went into rural exile last month after making a public apology for abuses under his seven-year rule, which ended in February. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, a former general and once a close ally of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, has distanced himself from <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> while asking the nation to forgive him. But opposition parties say they will not agree to a pardon for <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> unless he appears before a National Assembly inquiry. Opposition parties have demanded that <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> account for misdeeds by his associates and relatives. They are accused of extorting money from businesses, diverting government funds, selling influence and forcing political donations. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> has denied any personal corruption, but some of his relatives and associates have been arrested or convicted of corruption. Last week, prosecutors arrested two former government ministers on corruption charges. It was the first arrest of ministers of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s administration. Prosecutors have promised to expand their case into suspected corruption involving former government officials and <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s aides.

 Four hundred police, troops and civilian volunteers fanned out through remote areas of northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on Saturday for debris from the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet that crashed across the border in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. A British newspaper, quoting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence sources, reported that the plane was sabotaged by Iranian terrorists aided by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. A West German newspaper reported Saturday that the plane was sabotaged by an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> terrorist aided by a Palestinian group and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Twenty-eight bodies still were missing after the Dec. 21 explosion that blew apart the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 over this Scottish village, killing all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground. The main search area has moved east from the vast Kielder Forest near the border with <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Harwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, almost 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Northumberland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s northernmost county. A police spokesman said Saturday's search had found nothing significant. Wreckage from the explosion and crash has been found over a 65-mile stretch, from the <PERSON> Solway </PERSON> <PERSON> Firth </PERSON> in the west to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in the east. About 220 volunteers from mountain rescue teams around the country have joined the troops and police. The Sunday Telegraph of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said on Sunday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies believe the terrorists who planted the bomb came from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and were aided by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The respected weekly quoted unidentified intelligence sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as saying `` hard evidence is emerging'' to show that Iranian Revolutionary Guards sabotaged the plane in part for reprisal for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> passenger plane last summer. The newspaper said `` there is a suspicion that Libyans acted as ` a conduit' for the explosives and provided intelligence for the Iranian team.'' It said the information came from an intelligence official who would not disclose the source or details of the evidence. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> said: `` We know nothing about that at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, a newspaper said Saturday the bomb that destroyed the plane was planted by an <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> terrorist with Libyan and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> assistance. The Hamburg-based <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> investigators believe the terrorist boarded the plane in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> but left the flight in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The newspaper did not cite sources. New York-bound Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, but passengers and luggage switched planes in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, which is in charge of the investigation, said Saturday he knew nothing of the <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> report and that he believes it is speculation. British authorities have dismissed numerous and often contradictory media accounts of how and where and by whom the bomb was planted, saying those questions remained unanswered. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> planned the bombing with a group called the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, led by terrorist <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION>, which is known for good government sources in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> but has often been inaccurate in the past, said the terrorist was trained in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.

 Soviet aircraft are tentatively scheduled to pick up prefabricated housing for Armenian earthquake survivors at an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base that is home to a squadron responsible for keeping enemy aircraft out of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> airspace. The two <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> cargo jets are to land Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> McChord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, which would be the first time Soviet aircraft have landed at the base, McChord officials said. An F-15 fighter interceptor squadron is at the base. The Soviet heavy freight transports are to each carry six shelters developed two weeks ago for quick reassembly in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Volunteer workers at companies here made the shelters, 32 feet by 32 feet, of plywood, tin roofs and insulation sufficient to protect as many as 40 people from temperatures as low as 40 below zero. The Soviet planes are scheduled to refuel at <ORGANIZATION> Elmendorf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, en route to <PERSON> McChord </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, at least 13 firefighters have volunteered to go on the flights to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to assemble the shelters. The shelters are designed to last about three years, replacing canvas tents while Soviets rebuild their earthquake-ravaged cities. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who arranged the flights partly through his contacts as president of a group planning the 1990 Goodwill Games, said all that remained for final approval was the filing of a flight plan with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iraklij </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chichiabaja </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> district manager in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, also said tentative clearance has been given for the planes to land at the base.

 A prosecutor approved a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request to question seven former government officials about the 1976 assassination in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of a retired Chilean minister, news reports said Saturday. However, the ruling Thursday by prosecutor <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Pica </PERSON> must be upheld by a six-member panel of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which is to meet Monday, local newspapers said. The panel includes two justices who have in the past opposed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extradition requests in the case. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Letelier </PERSON> and an American aid, <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffit </PERSON>, were killed on Sept. 21, 1976, by a bomb that blew up <PERSON> Letelier </PERSON>'s car as he drove along Embassy Row in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Letelier </PERSON> was an ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and later foreign minister in the leftist government of President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>. Letelier was an avowed foe of <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who overthrew the government in a 1973 coup that left Allende dead. Investigators believe that the seven former Chilean officials may have information about what they describe as a plot by Chilean intelligence agents to kill <PERSON> Letelier </PERSON> and a later cover-up, according to papers filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request, signed by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, was filed Dec. 28 by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> through the Chilean <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> wants to question Gen. <PERSON> Odlanier </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, former head of the secret police; <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON>, former foreign minister; air force Gen. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Montero </PERSON>, former interior minister; <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barros </PERSON>, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Trucco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Cauas </PERSON>, all former Chilean ambassadors to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Amenabar </PERSON>, who was at the time a charge d'affaires in the Chilean Embassy. <PERSON> Cauas </PERSON> was later appointed finance minister. <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> is now a prominent foe of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s government.

 The central figure in two federal inquiries involving <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has denied using drugs with the mayor, a newspaper reported Saturday. The Virgin Islands Daily News also quoted <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> as defending his role in a heavily-criticized joint venture between the governments of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> government official, was the target of a police drug effort on Dec. 22 after a maid at his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel complained he had offered her drugs in exchange for sex. An undercover attempt to buy drugs from <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> that day was called off after <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> showed up at <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' room However, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> denied offering drugs to the hotel maid in exchange for sex, the newspaper said. He was quoted as saying that a misunderstanding arose when he was looking for writing paper to complete a job application. `` There was a service tray with writing paper on it, and I asked the housekeeper, in the presence of two maintenance men, in Spanish, if I could have the paper. `` When I got the paper off the tray, a light piece of plastic _ probably a used disposable shower cap _ fell off the tray, and I picked it up to give to the housekeeper,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` She started acting funny,'' he was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was in his room later to help him find a job. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who had not spoken publicly about the incident until the press account Saturday, remains at an undisclosed location. His version of the story differs little from that of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who said he was simply visiting an old friend at the hotel. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has denied using drugs with <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and said he was unaware <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was under police investigation. Federal investigators are trying to determine whether <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> thwarted a separate police investigation into the matter, why he was visiting <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> at the hotel, and whether <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was using or selling drugs. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has denied interfering with the city's drug investigation. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, has expanded his inquiry to include the city's involvement in a $ 260,000 joint venture between the city and <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> government to upgrade the islands' personnel system. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> headed the project but was fired in April after <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> officials became concerned about cost overruns. <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> is trying to find out whether city officials working on the project charged personal items and expenses to their account with the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> government. In his <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> interview, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the reason hotel costs for the personnel project were so high was because <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> was slow with paperwork, which put the project into the busy season when rates are higher. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> as saying Friday that he fired <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> because he was `` dissatisfied with the pace of the activities'' and felt some of the consultants' expenditures `` warranted criminal investigation.''

 The government on Saturday denied charges that French construction workers in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> roughed up 15 <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> environmentalists protesting an airstrip being built near a penguin sanctuary. A statement from the environmental group, issued in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said its members were knocked down and dragged through mud and rocks by workers at an airstrip at <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Dumont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Urville </ORGANIZATION> station, located on one of five small <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> islands claimed by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. It was <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>'s fourth expedition to <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, where the organization established the only non-government run environmental base in 1987. The expedition was to spend seven weeks visiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, West German, Soviet, <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> to document waste disposal and pollution. The group went to the French base to protest the construction of a runway which they say will cut through a natural breeding ground and migration area for penguins. The clash occurred after protesters erected a portable hut in the path of French bulldozers and held a banner reading `` Halt the Airstrip _ <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> communique said the station's officer-in-charge saw a video of the brawl and `` admitted the construction workers were out of control,'' <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> expedition coordinator <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said in the statement. A spokesman for <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pensec </PERSON>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s minister for overseas territories, denied a conflict occurred and said the group received authorization from the government to visit the French station. The group had been welcomed on arrival Thursday by 30 French scientists, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with ministry rules. He said the ministry had spoken with authorities at the base who confirmed the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> members erected a hut on the airstrip. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> has clashed with <PERSON> Frane </PERSON> several times. In 1985 the <ORGANIZATION> Greepeace </ORGANIZATION> vessel Rainbow Warrior was bombed in <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION> harbor by people who were later identified as working for the French intelligence service.

<HEAD>Group Forms Apparently To Counter Activists; Party Chief Warns Ethnic

<TEXT>
 A group formed Saturday appears to challenge local activists seeking autonomy in the Baltic republic of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief says independent organizations are causing ethnic divisions. The new Latvian organization, the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, held its organizing congress in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> capital. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, said preliminary data indicate the group is supported by 300,000 of the republic's 2.6 million inhabitants. `` The new mass organization proclaimed its main goal to promote and further extend the perestroika reform program,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, referring to the campaign for economic and social change mounted by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. However, <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> nationalists and activists say the group is dominated by ethnic Russians and is intended to be a counterweight to the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which is seeking greater autonomy for the Baltic republic from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` They are anti-perestroika,'' said <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON>, a Riga-based member of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, an independent group seeking to challenge the political monopoly of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. At a Thursday meeting of the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the republic's party chief, <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vagris </PERSON>, seemed to distance himself both from the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. According to state-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Vagris </PERSON> said `` various public organizations had emerged lately in the republic, such as the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, where ethnic Latvians constitute a majority, and the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, made up mostly of people of other nationalities living in the republic.'' The existence of such groups `` has been causing ethnic stratification in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Both movements have some extremist-minded elements,'' <PERSON> Vagris </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` Both also involve members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which means that there is also stratification within the party.'' He said that was `` impermissible'' and called on the organizations to `` lose no time in renouncing confrontation and join forces instead in promoting the process of perestroika,'' <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said. Despite <PERSON> Vagris </PERSON>' criticisms, one of the founders of the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said its members were seeking ethnic harmony but indicated the group will seek to remain outside party control. `` When creating the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, we proceeded from the fact that the interests of the working people of various nationalities largely coincided, while differences between them were not antagonistic,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Belaichuk </PERSON> as telling the Saturday congress. `` It means we can jointly work for the victory of perestroika initiated by our <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Belaichuk </PERSON>, a rector at the <ORGANIZATION> Riga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION>. Ethnic Latvians make up 54 percent of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s population, according to the most recent official data, obtained in the 1979 Soviet census. Ethnic Russians total 33 percent of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s population, while 5 percent are Ukrainians, 3 percent Byelorussians and 3 percent ethnic Poles

 On the most beautiful and wild of the state's rugged beaches lie hundreds of sea birds wrapped like mummies in heavy oil Some are moving. Others are not. They are victims of the second-largest oil spill in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> waters. The oil that poured from a barge Dec. 22 was thought to have dissipated at sea after some of it moved onto the southern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast. But a storm just before New Year's brought the oil rushing back to shore, fouling 300 miles of coastline, including the pristine northern beaches of the Olympic Peninsula and on <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` I think it's kind of outrageous that this can happen,'' said <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> of Forks as she helped clean a beach where she and her family go regularly. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday more than 6,400 birds have been recovered from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> beaches, about 4,000 of them dead. An estimated 85 birds have been cleaned and released and 675 more have been washed; scientists say more than half of those washed are likely to die. Some of the estimates had been revised downward Saturday based on more complete information, officials said. Hundreds more contaminated waterfowl have been recovered from beaches in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, while uncounted others probably died at sea. Damage to other parts of the ecosystem is less obvious and probably less severe, but it may take months to evaluate, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a biologist and oil spill expert for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Currents along the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast shift to the south in the spring and could deposit even more oil on beaches. `` In a few years, maybe these beaches will be back to normal, but the effects will be seen for months, if not years to come,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Janda </PERSON>, chief park ranger for the Olympic National Park. `` In some areas the oil will always be there, on rocks or on logs, to serve as a reminder.'' Many of the dead birds are taken away in bags by volunteers so that bald eagles and other birds of prey wo n't eat them and be poisoned. The live birds that can be captured are placed in other bags, waiting for a bath that may save their lives. Two persistent birds, cleaned and tagged, were released at an area without oil, only to be picked up again, re-oiled, at a beach farther north. The spill that occurred off <LOCATION> Grays </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> when a tug collided with an oil barge it had been towing at first appeared limited to 70,000 gallons. Environmentalists were relieved when most of the oil swept back out to sea, with only a bit clinging to the <LOCATION> Grays </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> estuary, where many species feed. But last weekend, it turned out that as much as 231,000 gallons had spilled, and the storm drove it shoreward, blackening more beaches, mostly to the north. Bird-cleaning centers were opened at <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION>, at <LOCATION> Neah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> to the north and at <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore </LOCATION>. Already the accident has claimed more birds than the largest marine spill in state history. About 4,000 birds died in December 1985 when 239,000 gallons of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> crude leaked into <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> harbor from a tanker that ran aground. Damage to other life appears minimal so far, experts said. No sea mammal deaths have been conclusively linked to the spill. Most of the toxic, lighter elements already had been refined out of the heavy oil, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, a biologist with the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION>, said most of the oil will break up, allowing most of the toxic hydrocarbons to evaporate. Ms. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> was generally optimistic because the fouled areas are north of clam and oyster beds and a smelt spawning habitat, but she said mussels, barnacles and starfish might be affected. Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, who toured the coast Wednesday, said the spill strengthens his resolve to oppose federal plans for oil and gas drilling off the coast.

 Authorities are deporting eight foreigners accused of posing as Colombian military officials to ship $ 8 million worth of weapons through <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, an official said Saturday. National Security Minister <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, who made the announcement, did not identify the men. However, he said three were Colombian, four Panamanian, and one British. He said the men were involved in `` narco-terrorism and the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel,'' referring to a leading Colombian drug-trafficking group. `` In questioning the conspirators, it was learned that the arms were destined for a leftist Colombian insurgent group called the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colombia </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` This group is in league with and financed by Colombian cocaine traffickers.'' The rebel group, one of several opposed to the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government, has made known through an intermediary that it would like to open peace talks with the government. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the weapons arrived on this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island shortly before Christmas via a Panamanian-registered freighter. He said Colombian officials were invited to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> on Thursday to witness the opening of the crates, which contained machine guns, assault rifles, mortars and hand guns. The Colombian officials returned with the weapons and the three detained Colombians on Friday, he said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the Panamanians and Briton were to be deported Saturday. He said two of the Panamanians were pilots who were to fly the weapons from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The official said the weapons were paid for by cocaine sent to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> radio listeners may be startled Sunday morning to hear traffic reports delivered by Commander <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, who surveys road conditions in a B-52 bomber and shoots at stalled cars. The maniacal traffic reporter is the creation of comedian <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Candy </PERSON> and a radio troupe whose new syndicated comedy show, `` Radio Kandy,'' is a parody of popular radio. The weekly two-hour show, featuring Candy as a disc jockey, is scheduled to be heard at 8 a.m. Sundays on <ORGANIZATION> KNX-FM </ORGANIZATION> and eventually over 225 radio stations nationwide. It is distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> Transtar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. Candy first gained fame on `` Second City TV,'' -LRB- `` SCTV'' -RRB- a now-defunct show about a fictional television station. From there Candy moved to the big screen, starring in such movies as `` Splash,'' `` Planes, Trains and Automobiles,'' and `` Little Shop of Horrors.'' Joining Candy on the show will be `` SCTV'' alumni <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, <PERSON> Valri </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromfield </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. Candy said many `` SCTV'' characters will be reprised for radio, but it will not be a `` Second City Radio.'' `` I do n't know what it is going to be yet; we'll see what works. That is how ` SCTV' evolved,'' he said. Candy said he is not in danger of becoming a so-called `` shock radio'' DJ. `` It's like how gross can you get? How low can you go? Who can you wake up and disturb? Whose life can you wreck today? And when you finally meet these people, they are really quite the opposite,'' he said. `` We will give a nice mixture of music and humor,'' Candy said. `` It wo n't beat you over the head.''

 Police arrested nearly 100 anti-abortion protesters Saturday who sang Christmas carols while blocking doorways and jamming elevators at an abortion clinic, officials said. Police dragged and carried away the protesters, who filled hallways of a busy office building and prevented 15 women from entering the Planned Parenthood League of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> clinic, officials said. Four of the protesters fastened heavy-duty bicycle locks around their necks, interweaving the locks and throwing away the keys. `` It just makes it take longer -LRB- to clear the entrance -RRB-,'' explained protester <PERSON> Darroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Firlit </PERSON>. `` It takes them a long time to try a hacksaw and figure out that it wo n't work and then get the Fire Department and send for a locksmith.'' `` It only takes three minutes to kill a baby. So every three minutes we save is another life.'' Another group of 50 to 75 anti-abortion protesters, also members of the national anti-abortion group <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>, picketed peacefully outside the downtown building, said Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Coakley </PERSON>. Police said 92 protesters who blocked entrances to the clinic and refused to move were arrested, charged with trespassing and released on their own recognizance pending arraignment Tuesday. The protest was one in a series of anti-abortion demonstrations in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in recent months, including one Dec. 31 in which about 75 members of Operation Rescue's <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> chapter were arrested. The clinic opened three hours late, at 11 a.m., after all the protesters were removed, and all but one of 15 patients who had abortion appointments in the morning waited for the protesters to be hauled away rather than reschedule the procedure, clinic officials said. About 50 members of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> staged a counter-protest outside the building. `` It would be unheard-of to block a voting booth,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Convisser </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> NOW chapter. `` And it should be equally underheard-of to block my constitutional right to enter an abortion clinic.''

<HEAD>Radioactive House Cleanup To Cost $9.5 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANSDOWNE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The cleanup of a radioactive house contaminated by a professor processing radium in the basement will cost $ 9.5 million and involve digging up neighbors' lawns and possibly garages, federal officials say. It is the second major price increase for the project, which is being financed by the federal Superfund cleanup program. In 1984, the cleanup cost was estimated at $ 2 million. Last August, as the cleanup began, officials estimated the cost at $ 7.5 million. `` A lot of the areas we are excavating turned out to be contaminated,'' <PERSON> Nanci </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. `` In some areas we went down seven to nine feet'' before finding clean soil. Officials found that portions of the lawns of four surrounding homes were radioactive. Since August, contractors have been pulling apart the house and its lawn. The house was contaminated in the 1930s and 1940s by a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> professor. By November, contractors had torn down the entire house and shipped it to a special dump site in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Only the lawn remained, but that has proven to be much more radioactive than previously thought, <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> said. Instead of the 1,000 tons of soil contractors expected to remove, they will cart off 2,200 tons to the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> dump, <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Janosik </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> project manager, said he expects the cleanup to be completed by May or June. `` I've never seen the price of these things go down,'' he said.

 The family of a <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student killed in the explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 learned shortly before her scheduled funeral they received the wrong body, the victim's father said Saturday. `` I know my daughter is still out there somewhere, either in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, unidentified, or shipped somewhere else,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>. `` And we have a body here that some family is grieving over.'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said the body of his daughter, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>, was examined by the <ORGANIZATION> Monroe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>'s Office Friday. Examiners determined Saturday through dental records and X-rays that it was n't <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>'s body, he said `` They told me this morning they were 100 percent positive it was n't <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>'s body,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home in the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Halik </PERSON>, a specialist in dental identification of the dead, said he determined the body was not <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>'s after examining it in the medical examiner's office Saturday. `` Nothing matched ... just about nothing,'' <PERSON> Halik </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, chief medical examiner, said other physical discrepancies also existed. British officials in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> said they were investigating. `` A question has been raised regarding the body of <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>,'' officials said in a terse statement. `` The matter is the subject of further discussion and examination by appropriate medical specialists.'' Hunt received word Tuesday from authorities in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> that the body of his daughter, who would have turned 21 Saturday, had been identified. Miss <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s aunt then called officials in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> to get a description of the clothes on the body, he said. `` What the person over there described did n't sound like <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>'s,'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. The funeral, which had been scheduled for Friday, was postponed. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said he's concerned another family might receive <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>'s body and cremate it without knowing its true identity `` You can exhume a body, but you ca n't identify it once it's been cremated,'' he said. Miss <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> was returning to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after completing a one-semester program in <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s Division of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abroad </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>France Negotiating Jet Deal With Libya, Report Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is negotiating to sell jet fighters to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official was quoted as saying in a report published Sunday. The Sunday Telegraph said the senior official, who the report did not name, said information about the deal to sell <ORGANIZATION> Mirage </ORGANIZATION> jet fighters was compiled with the help of European intelligence agencies. The report did not say how many jets were under negotiation. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kudla </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he had not seen the report and could not comment on it. The newspaper said <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> `` wants to replenish his stock of aging -LRB- Soviet -RRB- MiG planes with the latest French fighter,'' the Mirage. It said the French government first sold <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> a version of the Mirage in 1978 which was delivered in the early 1980s, although <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> now receives most of its military equipment from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fears that, if the Libyans had been equipped with the new Mirage, the fight over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> last week could have ended differently,'' said the report, referring the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of two Libyan planes on Wednesday. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had not confronted the French with its knowledge.

 Best-selling author <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Cussler </PERSON> led 200 volunteers Saturday in a search for a locomotive believed buried in a dry creek bed during an 1878 flood, but the hunt's first day ended with no clues unturned. <PERSON> Cussler </PERSON> said he was not optimistic after workers found only a part from a railroad car, some tubing and what appeared to be part of an old farm wagon. `` If I had five guys with magnetometers and lined them up we'd find it,'' he said `` But -LRB- with 200 volunteers -RRB- it's too unwieldy. None of them have ever worked together before.'' The search was to be completed on Sunday. A <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> locomotive reportedly fell 30 feet from a railroad bridge, along with 19 of its 25 cars and a caboose, on the night of May 21, 1878, when an enormous flood struck the area 30 miles east of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Twelve of the cars and the locomotive were said to have been buried in the sand. The front brakeman, fireman and engineer all were killed. <PERSON> Cussler </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, has become somewhat of a guru to people who dream of discovering lost relics. Through his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Underwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the author of `` Raise the Titanic'' has located 54 sunken vessels, including a dirigible. But this is his first buried train. He said he learned about the train from articles several years ago. `` I put it away and filed it and I used it for a germ for my book, ` Night Probe,''' he said. `` I brought a psychic out once. He did n't spot the train but he found a target I had marked.'' Volunteers used shovels and hand-held metal detectors while several archeologists and flood experts used a land radar unit to search. Some volunteers, like <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotzinger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedoruk </PERSON>, said they joined the search because they are fans of the writer. Two backhoes dug three large holes in the creekbed in areas targeted by metal detectors. But water filled the holes about 10 feet under the surface. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> of <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, found the flat car part, which he described as a horseshoe-shaped piece of metal that held a gear. If the locomotive is found, it will belong to the landowner, <PERSON> Cussler </PERSON> said. Since most of the equipment has been donated, the cost of the search is less than $ 1,000, said agency spokesman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Dirgo </PERSON>. The town of <LOCATION> Kiowa </LOCATION>, near where the tragedy occurred, was renamed <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to honor two of the victims' widows, sisters whose maiden names were <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. Local newspapers reported that about two weeks after the accident, a man named <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> <PERSON> Londoner </PERSON> searched for the locomotive, using a magnetized crowbar. The Rocky Mountain News reported that the crowbar suddenly plunged violently into the sand, dragging Londoner with it `` to the astonishment of the spectators.'' Two hours later, Londoner reportedly emerged from the bog to announce that he had found the missing engine 8 feet under the ground and some distance downriver from the bridge. However, the newspaper story does n't say the locomotive was recovered. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION>, has said he thinks it unlikely that the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> would have left such a large, expensive locomotive in the sand. He said the railroad was in financial straits, and human labor was cheap at the time. The locomotive was said to be worth $ 18,000, by one account. However, 79-year-old <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, whose father was a 15-year-old railroad worker at the time of the flood, thinks the train is still there. `` My father said emphatically that nobody salvaged the locomotive,'' she said. <PERSON> Dirgo </PERSON> said the most recent organized search for the train was in May 1953 by a <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> professor. `` They only searched an area of 150 by 400 feet and did n't have the kind of equipment we have now,'' <PERSON> Dirgo </PERSON> said.

 Chanting monks pounded drums as tens of thousands of people thronged the moated Imperial Palace on Sunday to pray for <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, the emperor who presided over <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s jorney from war to ruin to economic rebirth. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> died at dawn Saturday, and 3 -LCB- hours later his 55-year-old son <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> silently accepted the regalia of the Chrysanthemum Throne in a 4-minute ceremony. The new emperor bowed as the symbols of his new position were placed before him in a large room in the palace. Included were the state and imperial seals and two of the three imperial treasures _ a sword and jewels. The third, an ancient mirror, is enshrined on the palace grounds. Later, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> used a calligraphy brush to sign formal approval for <LOCATION> Heisei </LOCATION> _ Achieving Peace _ as the name of his reign The name will be used on calendars and official documents. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death at age 87 ended a 62-year reign, the longest of any Japanese monarch. During that time, he announced <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surrender in World War II, gave up his divinity and saw his nation emerge as a world economic power The Cabinet met Sunday morning to deliberate on funeral arrangements and, following precedent of earlier imperial funerals held at least six weeks after death, set Feb. 24 as the date for <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s burial. Tradition calls for dozens of ceremonies, some elaborate, others poignantly simple, to lay <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> to rest. Thirty-six ceremonies have been announced for the first year, the official mourning period for the imperial family. The Cabinet announced it was considering an amnesty of prisoners to mark <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s passing, that it was watching ultra-leftists against the possibility of anti-emperor guerrilla activity, and that it expected many foreign dignitaries to attend the state funeral. Meanwhile, people streamed to the palace in central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to sign condolence registers. Sunday morning alone, 44,332 people signed their names up to 10:30 a.m., the palace said, and the throng was growing. The rain-soaked streets around the palace, normally quiet on Sunday, were crowded as if it was a weekday rush hour. The crowds were quiet, the stillness broken only by the chanting of a half-dozen <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks who thumped drums and chanted prayers for the dead emperor. Nationwide, 430,000 people signed registers on Saturday, news reports said. The government declared an official six-day mourning period. Many celebrations, store sales and other events have been canceled, while others, including a rugby tournament and sumo tournament, were rescheduled. `` The sad news of the passing of his late majesty the emperor has left me grief-stricken,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said. `` Our sincere prayers for his recovery were in vain, and I am at a loss for words.'' Workers at train stations, restaurants, stores and airlines donned black ribbons, and flags were lowered to half-staff or draped with black bunting. Television networks dropped advertising and regular programs to broadcast documentaries on the imperial family, interviews with scholars and politicians and reports from overseas on how the emperor's death was received. Thousands of viewers called to complain about the changes, while others simply rented videos. Many older Japanese, who grew up thinking of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> as a demigod, expressed sorrow. In <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an 87-year-old former <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldier hanged himself, saying in a note, `` I want to follow the emperor in death.'' `` I heard the news on TV and I could not stay home any longer,'' said a weeping elderly woman at the palace. `` I feel so sorry that his life was filled with so many difficulties. I pray that he can rest peacefully now.'' `` It was a shock when I first heard the news though I knew it was inevitable and I thought I was ready for it,'' said <PERSON> Tetsuji </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikkawa </PERSON>, 65. `` I have really mixed feeling because I went to the war -LRB- World War II -RRB- and many of my friends died for the emperor.'' Many businesses, from banks to pachinko pinball parlors, stayed open, but on Saturday night, the bright lights of the <LOCATION> Ginza </LOCATION> shopping district and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s entertainment districts were dark. The emperor's death was not expected to cause major disruptions in business. Stock exchanges canceled their Saturday half-day sessions but officials said trading would resume this week. Officials said 15,000 riot police were mobilized in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> area to guard against possible actions by radicals, as both the left and the right see the emperor as a focus of Japanese nationalism and militarism. Leftists want the imperial system abolished; rightists want it strengthened. Demonstrators gathered at several locations to protest the imperial system and the attention given <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death. Police arrested 10 members among some 100 from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest radical leftist group, the Chukaku-ha, on charges of possessing dangerous weapons after they tried to push past police lines with bamboo poles. At another location in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, 100 people marched for about an hour but there were no arrests. `` We do n't want an emperor anymore!'' chanted the marchers, who carried a banner reading, `` We shall not forget World War II.'' `` I could not stand the thought that people outside <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are going to think all Japanese are emperor lovers and everyone is crying over his death,'' said protest organizer <PERSON> Ryuichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Harada </PERSON>. One passer-by said of the protesters: `` Are they really Japanese?''

 A Nicaraguan rebel leader was killed by machine-gun fire as he drove along a highway west of the Honduran capital, police said Saturday. The body of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rugama </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>, 39, also known as `` Commander Aureliano'', was riddled with 26 Uzi machine gun bullet wounds, police officials said. <PERSON> Rugama </PERSON> apparently was alone when he shot as he drove along a highway west of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. Officers later found his body on the street, outside the vehicle he was driving to a friend's home to attend a birthday party. They said they had no more details about the killing. Leaders of the anti-Sandinista rebels, known as the Contras, immediately blamed the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> Sandinista government for the killing of one of their regional commanders. They said <PERSON> Rugama </PERSON> had been scheduled to meet with other Contra leaders in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> that afternoon. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels, who are trying to overthrow <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government. `` The Nicaraguan Resistence profoundly laments this act perpetrated by the communists of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, who are our only enemies,'' said <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, a member of the Nicaraguan <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION>. He spoke Saturday in a telephone interview. A doctor by profession, <PERSON> Rugama </PERSON> had been a Contra for nine years. He was the organization's Segovia regional commander. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rugama </PERSON> had returned to <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> two days ago after visiting with his mother, <PERSON> Elsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>, another Contra directorate member, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview Saturday that `` our organization does n't have the slightest doubt that the Sandinista regime sent a commando to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to kill not only Commander <PERSON> Auerliano </PERSON>, but also other high-ranking members of the Nicaraguan Resistence.

<HEAD>Detroit Parishes Get Word of Closings, Some Spared</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of at least a dozen Roman Catholic inner-city churches were told Saturday that their parishes will close by summer, while others rejoiced upon learning they wo n't have to sit in someone else's pew. The plan first announced in September by the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> called for closing or merging 48 parishes, the most widespread move of its kind in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Catholic history. Officials cited declining membership, a shortage of priests and the increasing cost of supporting the parishes. But according to announcements at services Saturday, three parishes targeted for closing would be kept open; two would be merged with other churches; and two would remain open until their pastors retired. At least 18 other parishes mentioned in the original list were designated as `` questionably viable.'' Each was given six months to a year to coduct a self-study about its future with the assistance of archdiocesan leaders, parishioners were told Saturday. Nearly two dozen other parishes that did not have Saturday Masses were to learn their fates Sunday. Cardinal <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> disclosed his final decisions to pastors in private meetings last week, giving them permission to release the information during weekend services. A formal announcement by <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> was scheduled for Sunday afternoon. <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> has defended the closings as necessary to wipe out a `` plantation mentality'' in which white pastors and lay people run churches attended mostly by blacks because of white flight to the suburbs. But his home has been picketed by both black and white parishioners in the nation's sixth-largest city. At <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theresa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION>, which will merge with another parish, the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morand </PERSON> said he was asked to keep the news a secret until his Saturday afternoon Mass. `` The idea is that he -LRB- <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> -RRB- sticks a dagger in you and says, ` Do n't tell anybody it's there until Saturday,''' <PERSON> Morand </PERSON> said. `` I really believe he sincerely thinks he's right. But he says he's doing God's will He has said that often, and I resent it very much. `` It is n't God's will. It's a travesty.'' Attitudes were upbeat, however, at parishes spared closing. `` That's wonderful news.

 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, once venerated as a living god and made into the guiding spirit of a world war, today died of intestinal cancer, ending a 62-year reign that saw his nation recover from ruin to riches. He was 87. Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, oldest of the emperor's two sons, became the 125th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne. In a solemn, wordless four-minute ceremony, a sword, jewels and the imperial seals were placed on a table in front of him, and he bowed. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> died without ever having shed much light on his World War II role. Historians generally agree he was a figurehead who was required to approve decisions of the military leaders, until he decided the Japanese had suffered enough _ atomic bombing, firebombing and invasion _ and personally announced surrender in August 1945. His death followed a 3 -LCB- - month illness during which reports on his blood pressure and temperature became fixtures of Japanese routine and many festivities were postponed or canceled

<HEAD>West Germans Debate Whether to Work on Sunday</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Public debate about whether they should work on Sunday is making it hard for citizens of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s richest country to enjoy the sabbath quiet the Bible extols and their constitution protects Most West Germans hew to the tradition of a day on which the family has coffee and cake at home and the children often are even discouraged from going next door to play with friends. Popular magazines and newspapers carry contributions from prominent people singing the virtues of Sunday in church and at home. The constitution provides special protection for Sundays as days `` of rest from work and of spiritual uplift,'' but union leaders say 2.2 million in this nation of nearly 62 million people work at least one Sunday a month. <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappe </PERSON>, head of the 630,000-member chemical workers union, issued the latest call for more Sunday work. Other union leaders united against him in what one called an `` avalanche'' of opposition. <PERSON> Rappe </PERSON> was quoted as saying in an interview with the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Osnabruecker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION>: `` The unions must be ready to negotiate over Sunday work for reasons of economics. `` I'd prefer to have businesses use their money to create jobs in the Federal Republic -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- rather than in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. If that's only possible with more work on weekends, the unions ca n't simply say no. Business representatives praised him. <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Murmann </PERSON>, head of the national management council, called <PERSON> Rappe </PERSON>'s comments a `` beneficial shot of realism.'' Leaders of the printers, public workers, office workers, the mighty, 2.5-million-member steel workers union and some others did n't find his viewpoint beneficial in the least. `` <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappe </PERSON>'s position was not and is not that of the printers union, spokeswoman <PERSON> Ulla </PERSON> <PERSON> Krause-Schaeuffler </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` He has set off an avalanche. We are currently in negotiations to block Sunday work.'' <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillgaertner </PERSON>, spokesman for the public workers, said his union wants to keep Sunday work to a minimum because `` the cultural value of having Sunday off ranks above the principle of maximizing profits.'' <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Breit </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> DGB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> federation </ORGANIZATION>, which has 7.7 million members, also has expressed public opposition to work on Sunday. Church leaders, worried about a drop in attendance, have been steadfast in disapproval. `` We stand by our previous positions,'' Lutheran church spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollmar </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, citing the importance `` of the observance of the Lord's Day and the cultural role of Sunday.'' The issue even united <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and Lutheran prelates in 1984 long enough to issue a joint statement denouncing further expansion of Sunday work. `` The Bible teaches us: ` God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on that day he ceased from all the work he had set himself to do,'' the statement said in a citation from Genesis. `` Remember to keep the sabbath day holy,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders added, quoting from Exodus.

<TEXT>
 More than three decades after renouncing his <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> citizenship and returning to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, novelist <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heym </PERSON>'s American experience continues to infuse his writing and offend his nation's censors `` From my experience in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> I learned to fight back and speak up,'' the 75-year-old writer said in a recent interview at his <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> home. `` I learned that you do n't have to take things lying down.'' <PERSON> Heym </PERSON>'s critical views have resulted in a ban of almost all of his later works in his homeland, and he has struggled for more than two decades with East German censors. His latest book, a voluminous memoir titled `` Nachruf'' -LRB- `` Obituary'' -RRB-, has only been published in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Because of his prominence, East German officials allow him to publish his books in the West and to accept hard currency royalty payments. He is also permitted to travel freely to the West, a privilege enjoyed only by a select few of the nation's authors, artists and trusted party officials. `` I'm just too well known now for them to hurt me,'' <PERSON> Heym </PERSON> said, adding that he has won the grudging respect of party foes in his clashes with them over the years. His first novel, `` Hostages,'' was written in English and published in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1942. A movie based on the novel was released a year later. While his early work received considerable critical acclaim, most of his novels are no longer in print in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Heym </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the early 1950s after becoming disillusioned with the advent of the <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> era and the American involvement in the Korean War. `` I loved the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It was the time of <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> and the New Deal. Then came <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and it all changed,'' <PERSON> Heym </PERSON> said, referring to anti-communist hysteria sparked by Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> that left hundreds of creative artists blacklisted. <PERSON> Heym </PERSON>, the son of a Jewish merchant, was forced to flee <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1933 after the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> took power. He traveled first to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, where he worked as a journalist for a variety of left-wing publications. It was there that the young writer abandoned his given name of <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Flieg </PERSON> and created the pseudonym <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heym </PERSON> in order to secretly inform his family in <LOCATION> Chemnitz </LOCATION> -LRB- now <LOCATION> Karl-Marx-Stadt </LOCATION> -RRB- that he had arrived safely in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. In 1935, he received a scholarship from a New York-based Jewish organization and enrolled at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. He stayed on in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, writing and editing anti-fascist newspapers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s war engulfed more and more of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He later served in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in a special psychological warfare unit in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> charged with the task of demoralizing the will of German troops to fight. <PERSON> Heym </PERSON> published four novels in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which he said he believed at the time was the <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` where there was the most hope that something new and better could be forged.'' The respected Hamburg-based weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION>, however, in a review of `` Nachruf,'' suggested that other, opportunistic considerations were also a factor in his decision to return to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The reasons for <PERSON> Heym </PERSON>'s return appear well-known _ McCarthyism and the Korean War,'' <PERSON> Die </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeit </PERSON> said. `` But another factor played a role _ a lack of artistic success in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Then came the fortuituous invitation to return. In this he saw a chance for a new professional beginning.'' <PERSON> Heym </PERSON> said that after a brief, uncritical love affair with the fledgling communist state, he turned more and more to an analysis of social and political problems that brought a series of stern rebukes from the party's leadership, who rejected his calls for `` discussion without taboos.'' Official dissatisfication over the course of his writing prompted former East German leader <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulbricht </PERSON> to mockingly refer to <PERSON> Heym </PERSON> as `` an American writer with an East German passport.'' He still frequently writes passages in English first because `` its precision and economy demands clearer thinking than cloudy German.'' <PERSON> Heym </PERSON> devotes a considerable part of his best-selling `` Nachruf'' to detailing his battle with East German censors and his fight to break free of ideological limits imposed on his works. But it is also a compelling chronicle of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s rise to power and the fate of a generation uprooted and decimated by war. `` This was the most difficult book I have ever written,'' he said. `` It was an effort at self-accounting on a scale I had never attempted before.'' <PERSON> Heym </PERSON> said he used the third person in the memoir as a literary device in an effort to create a critical distance to his own life. He evokes a refined sense of history and self-irony in retelling his own often contradictory political development and the many macabre and brutal events that shaped the century. The narrative distance also helped him come to terms with the loss of relatives murdered by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. Three of <PERSON> Heym </PERSON>'s five aunts were murdered in Nazi death camps, along with a daughter he never knew. Many of his friends died in concentration camps or were executed for resistance efforts. <PERSON> Heym </PERSON> said he hoped that `` Nachruf'' would someday be approved for publication in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, although he predicted that it would not happen anytime soon. The government has begun to gradually soften its stand on several of his earlier books, approving the publication of two novels over the next two years.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Kieslowski </PERSON>, the director of `` A Short Film About Killing'' and `` A Short Film About Love,'' believes the human condition can be expressed by the ways people observe and ignore the Ten Commandments. The winner of the first European Film Prize, who sees human frailty in its purest form, has set out to do short films about all 10. But anyone expecting nicely packaged sermonettes in <PERSON> Kieslowski </PERSON>'s decalogue will find the effect quite startling `` A Short Film About Killing'' contains what he believes is the longest murder in film history, nearly eight minutes of brutality that he himself describes as too horrible even for a horror film. `` A Short Film About Love' speaks equally of loneliness and need, leaving the viewer scoffing at the superficiality of most relationships and rethinking the common assumption that true love brings happiness. Long one of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leading filmmakers, <PERSON> Kieslowski </PERSON> has remained relatively little known in the West. But these `` sophisticated and strange tales'' _ to use the words of one Polish critic _ may cause that to change. Already they have brought him far more acclaim than he ever expected. `` Killing'' recently won the first European Film Award, a statuette called `` The Felix,' in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The prize, to be awarded annually in a different European city, is intended to be <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s answer to the Academy Awards. Last May, the film won the 1988 Jury Award at the <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>. `` Love'' has been submitted as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s entry in the Oscar's best foreign film category <PERSON> Kieslowski </PERSON>, 47, an intense, ironic filmmaker whose past work has focused on people faced with ambiguous moral and political choices, has finished shooting the other eight films of his decalogue and is editing them for state-controlled Polish TV. `` It's not a religious inclination to make the Decalogue,'' he said in an interview, `` it's just a look at how difficult it is to live, how complicated life is. `` Moses came up with the Decalogue 6,000 years ago. Nobody has ever questioned it _ no ideology, no politics. -LRB- And yet -RRB- we violate it every day. That's interesting.'' Interesting enough for <PERSON> Kieslowski </PERSON> to work harder than he ever has in his life, he said. Instead of his usual pace of one film every four years, he is making 10 in a space of three years. `` Americans are always saying that if there is something good, you should shoot it immediately. And they are right. That's how it happened with the Decalogue. ... I'm surprised no one ever thought of it earlier. The first commandment that he completed was the fifth, Thou Shalt Not Kill. It resulted in the starkly titled `` A Short Film About Killing.'' The screenplay, which <PERSON> Kieslowski </PERSON> co-authored with a lawyer who is active in political causes, portrays the murder of a taxi driver by a young criminal and the youth's subsequent execution for the crime. The initial murder lasts seven minutes, 44 seconds. `` Film killing has its own form,'' <PERSON> Kieslowski </PERSON> said. `` We know how one kills or gets killed in movies. Unfortunately, in real life, one has to work very hard to kill a man. It's hard work.'' The ruthless hollow-cheeked killer, played by <PERSON> Miroslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Baka </PERSON>, struggles for what seems an eternity to strangle and beat to death the much larger taxi driver and then drag him down a river bank. Strangely, by the end of the film _ which portrays <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s mean streets at their meanest _ the audience is able to see the killer as a victim too. In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the film has given impetus to a drive to outlaw capital punishment, a goal which <PERSON> Kieslowski </PERSON> readily endorses. The movie `` is against the death penalty because it is against killing, any form of killing. Because I think that relations between people have become too brutal.'' Abruptly shifting gears from killing to love, <PERSON> Kieslowski </PERSON> made a haunting film about the crystalline love of an innocent 19-year-old for a worldly woman in her mid-30s whom he observes with the aid of a telescope from his room in an apartment block opposite hers. The film, which refers to the Sixth Commandment, ends with their positions reversed and the woman longingly watching for the boy through the window. Love fails to bring happiness, but afterwards they are `` wiser, better people,'' said <PERSON> Kieslowski </PERSON>. The critical acclaim for the films is a complete surprise, he said. `` Beginning the screenplays and beginning the production, we really did not have any idea they would go beyond <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kieslowski </PERSON> said. `` They are such small films ... very short, cheap films. It seemed to me they were unusually local, although obviously we were trying to give them a universal character.'' `` Killing,'' is being shown in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and it to be distributed throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said it may eventually be sold to an American distributor for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. For Polish audiences watching the films, there is unflinching faithfulness to the realities of life here, from a cafe that is out of tea at midday to the windswept, barren apartment blocks where families are packed like so many sardines. However, <PERSON> Kieslowski </PERSON> is not striving to portray life in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> but values that apply equally everywhere in the world. `` It's the same experience for an American, for a German, for a Frenchman, even for a Japanese. ... Everyone is afraid of death, no matter what party he belongs to.'' He said portraying such elemental, universal values was his main aim. `` Maybe I did not always succeed, but I was trying to make them in their purest forms.'' Although critical of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s political system, <PERSON> Kieslowski </PERSON> has continued to work within the state-controlled film industry rather than go abroad or underground. But he now avoids political themes in his work. `` I stopped being interested in politics a long time ago,'' he said. `` I hope it's for good, because it set me free.''

<TEXT>
 After a rip-roaring 1988, the film industry anticipates _ with wary optimism _ a new season that will bring such surefire moneymakers as <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the `` Star Trek'' gang, as well as the return of `` The Fly'' and those hilarious folks of `` Police Academy.'' If box-office hopes are somewhat guarded, that's because the movie menu is leaner than usual. Last year's 22-week writers' strike has finally been evidenced in fewer releases for the pre-summer season, traditionally a slow period. The fall stepup in production assures that the rest of the year will bring a plentiful supply. A cautious note is supplied by <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variety </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. After noting that the 1988 domestic -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> -RRB- gross would amount to a record $ 4.4 billion, he added a historical note: Previous industry booms have lasted 30 to 42 months, followed by an average 18 months of recession. The current prosperity began in June 1986. Hence a downturn is due, according to business cycles. The most awaited film event of 1989 is <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Indiana <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the Last Crusade,'' coming on May 24. The two previous adventures starring <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> rank among the top 10 moneymakers of all time.

 For the 17 months since a disturbed man walked onto the <ORGANIZATION> KNBC </ORGANIZATION> news set and pointed a toy gun at consumer reporter <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, he has waged a personal campaign against lookalike play weapons. <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, a 22-year veteran reporter who covered the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, has had some of his longest days and nights wrangling with manufacturers and retailers over toy guns that look like the real thing. It was just such a phony weapon, a Daisy BB pistol that looked like a Colt .45 automatic pistol, that <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stollman </PERSON> pointed at <LOCATION> Horowitz </LOCATION> on Aug. 19, 1987, as he demanded that <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> read a handwritten statement while on the air. <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> complied, but the broadcast went nowhere after a few seconds because <ORGANIZATION> KNBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Capra </PERSON> ordered the station to `` go to black'' _ shut down the broadcast signal. `` I was lucky I had my reading glasses on,'' said <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, referring to the bizarre, barely legible statement handed him by <PERSON> Stollman </PERSON>. During the short time the incident was on the air, <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> calmly asked the name and hometown of <PERSON> Stollman </PERSON>, the son of a <ORGANIZATION> KNBC </ORGANIZATION> reporter whose contract was not renewed that summer. `` It was the only thing I could think of,'' <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> said. `` I also thought that if I could get out a few hints to police of who this was and where he was from, they could follow leads.'' The broadcast journalist was questioned by <PERSON> Stollman </PERSON> about the sudden appearance of the `` stand by'' messages on studio monitors. Technicians were on strike at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> at the time, and <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> told <PERSON> Stollman </PERSON> that while there occasional difficulties, the station was still probably on the air. The last lines of <PERSON> Stollman </PERSON>'s note stated the gun he was holding was a harmless toy. When <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> read that, the 33-year-old man put the pistol down and was rushed by waiting police as news anchor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> grabbed the gun. <PERSON> Stollman </PERSON> later was placed on three years of intensively supervised probation. <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, meanwhile, intensified a campaign he had already started against the marketing of realistic toy guns. The effort, almost a second career, comes in addition to his consumer reporter job at <ORGANIZATION> KNBC </ORGANIZATION> and his syndicated `` Fight Back'' television show. <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, the city where <ORGANIZATION> KNBC </ORGANIZATION>'s studios are located, was the first locality to ban the sale of the toy guns, in August 1987. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> followed suit. And in October of 1988, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> signed a statewide ban on the sale, manufacture and distribution of replica firearms. But a few weeks after the state legislation was signed, <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> got a telephone call from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> which told him all his personal campaigning was about to be crushed. A congressional source told him that Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., had attached a rider to a late-session energy bill The rider called for some part of toy guns to be made of bright orange plastic, and the federal law would supersede the tougher state and local laws already passed. `` I took this very personally,'' said <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, who has campaigned in 15 states and as many as 30 cities across the country. He also estimates he has received 75,000 pieces of mail over the months on the subject of toy guns. <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> spent the next few days on the telephone. He said a toy manufacturer lobbyist did n't return his call. Neither did <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, although members of his staff told <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> they were unaware of the impact the rider could have on state and local laws. <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> said Sens. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, all of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, helped frame compromise wording that leaves tougher state and local laws in effect. The language about using bright orange plastic remained, and <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> has criticized it because fluorescent orange tape can make a real gun look like a toy or black paint can make a toy gun look real. `` But what I did n't want to see most of all was a bill that would have killed state and local legislation on guns,'' said <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, `` And we did get the pre-emption clause out of the bill.'' <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> estimates the toy industry makes $ 300 million annually from the sales of all types of toy guns. `` They tell me that kids want to play with toy guns and parents want to buy them. But the bottom line is bucks,'' he said. `` I'm not saying kids should n't play with toy guns, but they should play with toy guns that look like toys.''

<HEAD>Positive, But Not Definitive, Signs From Retail, Auto Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumers went on a spending spree in the last days of 1988, but while retailers and automakers are basking in the glow of impressive sales gains, few observers expect their good fortune to continue. The nation's biggest retailers had expected only a modestly good Christmas season following nearly two years of sluggish sales, but were pleasantly surprised when a last-minute burst of gift buying gave them stronger-than-anticipated results. Analysts estimated the retail industry's December sales rose in a range of 6 percent to 7.5 percent from a year earlier, better than the 6 percent gain forecast before the start of the holiday season. Meanwhile, sales of domestically-produced cars and light trucks soared 20.7 percent in the last 10 selling days of the year. The spurt boosted total sales of cars and light trucks to 15.44 million vehicles in 1988, up from 14.9 million in 1987. Most auto industry analysts had estimated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign car makers would sell about 14.5 million cars and light trucks in 1988. But despite that stellar performance, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an economic forecasting service in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said the yearend surge in auto sales was `` a one-time deal.'' Very attractive incentives by dealers `` kicked up the selling rate a bit the last 10 days of December,'' but the trend wo n't last because interest rates _ and the cost of financing a new car _ are moving higher, he said. `` We're looking for car sales to continue to weaken _ and they have weakened,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said, noting that while cars sold at an annual rate of 10.8 million cars in early 1988, sales later slipped to a rate of 10.2 million. Auto and retail sales are watched closely as barometers of consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the gross national product, the broadest measure of the economy's growth. A sharp drop in consumer spending could send the economy into a recession. Sales at general merchandise and apparel retailers began to slump nearly two years ago, although overall consumer spending generally increased. Americans were paying more money for services and necessities _ including cars _ and so had less money for what economists call `` discretionary spending,'' on items such as clothing and furniture. Christmas 1987 was a disappointment for many retailers, and they went into the 1988 holiday season _ when they generally make half their annual sales _ with lowered expectations. But consumers came through, especially in the last days before Christmas. Retail industry analysts are split now over whether Americans are likely to resume their cautious stance. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Consumers are in a mood to spend,'' but at the same time, he said, the retailers' recent sales gains can not be sustained <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Feiner </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, predicted that with the holidays over, consumers would again be hesitant. One thing is certain: No one will be sure about a sales trend until several more monthly sales reports come out. In other business news this past week: _ The government said the unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in December from November's 5.4 percent, indicating the economy remains robust In other reports, the government said construction spending increased for the third consecutive month in November while factory orders rose modestly. _ <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it would buy as many as 100 jets from <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 3 billion as part of a plan to expand the regional carrier, which has undergone three changes in owners and reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws in recent years _ Published reports said <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is in the process of acquiring <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was considering a bid to buy <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>., a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banking <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> refused to confirm or deny the reports, which said the investment firm could get about $ 1 billion in federal aid if it acquires MCorp. _ <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was suspended from participating in a $ 500 million <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> bond issue in the wake of its agreement to plead guilty in a federal securities fraud probe

<HEAD>Caution Prevails In First Week Of Bond Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond traders rang in the new year the same way they rang out the old _ with worries about inflation, the dollar and the stubborn trade and federal budget deficits lingering like a bad hangover. `` I think it's going to be a difficult year for the financial markets,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International He and a number of other economists are predicting that interest rates will head higher in the first half of 1989 due to the overall strength of the economy, although some experts are slightly more optimistic about the near-term. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> may do a little snugging here and there, but no major moves are needed,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. `` I think they tend to feel that interest rates are already high enough.'' Short-term rates, in particular, rose sharply in 1988, reflecting the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s desire beginning last March to tighten credit to prevent inflation from heating up. Longer-term rates remained fairly stable, though. That same trend continued into the first week of trading in 1989, causing a more pronounced inversion of the so-called yield curve, which illustrates the difference between short - and long rates and normally slopes upward `` We're seeing a flatter yield curve overall,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Held </ORGANIZATION>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. For instance, the yield on the three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill has risen 0.21 percentage points to 8.52 percent since the end of last year, while the yield on the 30-year bond moved up only 0.08 percentage points to 9.06 percent Part of the reason for the rise in short-term rates so far this year is that fact that the federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other on overnight loans, has remained relatively high. Some analysts say the rise in the fed funds rate represents merely a carryover of yearend corporate demand for money, but others say the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> could do more to keep a healthy dose of reserves in the banking system. `` There are a lot of things the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> could have said and done ... and did n't,'' said Held. Still, interest rates and bond prices remained relatively stable in the first week of 1989 trading, mainly because of the dollar's surprising strength in foreign exchange <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, which measures the price of all outstanding Treasuries, rose marginally since the end of last year. `` This strength in the dollar is giving us some breathing room in the year,'' said <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of two Libyan jets in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> this past week had helped push up the currency, since the dollar is often considered a safe haven amid international tension. The dollar still remains a major concern among bond traders this year, analysts say, since the market sentiment toward it remains fairly bearish. A weak currency makes dollar-denominated bonds less attractive to foreigners and often sparks higher inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income securities. Besides the lingering trade and budget deficits, which helped spark the 1987 stock market crash, bond traders this year remainly acutely worried about inflation as evidence points to a generally strong economy. `` You're not going to see inflation falling,'' said <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, who noted that the businesses are still using their plants and equipment to near capacity. One bit of positive news this past week, however, came from the December unemployment data. Although the jobless rate last month fell to 5.3 percent, dropping back to a 14-year low, many economists noted that average annual earnings remained unchanged for a third consecutive month and that the average factory work week declined. `` That is n't symptomatic of a booming economy,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Market Bids To Dispell Crash Memories</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It is no easy undertaking, but the stock market has been doing its best lately to dim investors' memories of the 1987 crash. In the early days of 1989, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials has rallied to its highest levels since the collapse. In fact, the Dow has moved to within hailing distance of its 2,246.74 close on Friday, Oct. 16 _ the session before it took a 508-point drop on Black Monday. If the Dow were to complete the mission of recouping its Black Monday loss, it would naturally serve as a morale booster on Wall Street. But the prospect has n't stirred up much excitement just yet. For one thing, legions of the smaller stocks not represented in the Dow remain well below their pre-Black Monday levels. The industrial average itself still stands more than 500 points below its peak of 2,722.42 reached on Aug. 25, 1987. Furthermore, the market's latest advance has failed to dazzle some of the Street's chart-watching analysts. `` We would caution against characterizing this as a chart breakout that would suggest significantly higher levels,'' said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinder </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. As it moved to a new post-crash high, <PERSON> Zinder </PERSON> pointed out, the Dow remained within the confines of a gradually rising trend that has been in force for a year The skeptics also wonder how far stock prices can go while interest rates are high and rising. Widespread expectations persist in the financial world that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will soon raise its discount rate, the charge it sets on loans to private banks, from the 6 -LCB- percent level that has prevailed since last summer. Such a move would mark the third consecutive increase in a sequence dating back to September of 1987. That, in turn, would invoke a warning indicator known as the `` three steps and a stumble'' rule developed years ago by the widely respected analyst <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>. Under this rule, three discount rate increases in a row signal a commitment by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to tighter credit that is stringent enough to put the stock market in jeopardy. `` One thing which has never changed and which never will change, in my opinion, is that sharply rising interest rates will eventually cause a sharply declining stock market,'' asserted <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLoggia </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, investment adviser. Despite such concerns, the Dow Jones industrials rose 25.72 points to 2,194.29 in the four sessions that made up the first trading week of the year. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index gained 1.70 to 157.96; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 3.36 to 384.74, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up 5.39 at 311.40. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 153.39 million shares a day, up from 114.15 million the week before. `` One of the first lessons a new investor learns is that the stock market dislikes rising interest rates,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON>, whose InvesTech advisory letter is published in <LOCATION> Whitefish </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. `` Not only does it give competing investments such as bonds and money market funds an edge, but higher rates eventually slow the economy. That leads to lower corporate profits. `` Bull markets rarely occur without favorable monetary conditions. It's very unusual for investors to mount a sustainable long-term advance while the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is putting on the brakes.''

<HEAD>Wages Flat As Unemployment Matches 14-Year Low</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: For Saturday PMs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Wages remained flat in December as the nation's jobless rate retreated to its 14-year low of 5.3 percent, according to a government report that indicates continued growth without worsening inflation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 3.75 points to 2,194.29, its highest point since the October 1987 stock market crash. Bond prices posted healthy gains. The dollar also rose. Ordinarily a drop in the jobless rate scares the bond market because it raises concerns that the economy is overheating, causing inflation that undermines the value of fixed-income investments. Inflationary pressures could prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to tighten credit by boosting interest rates, something that hurts both stocks and bonds. But analysts said the employment gains were expected, and they noted that average wages remained flat at $ 9.45 an hour for a third month. That eased inflation concerns. The jobless rate averaged 5.5 percent for all of 1988, down from 6.2 percent in 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. `` That gives some support to the notion that we have a strong economy but it has n't set off a new inflationary spiral yet,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. December's civilian unemployment rate was down 0.1 percentage point from November, hitting 5.3 percent for the third time in 1988, the lowest level since the 5.1 percent of May 1974 Service-producing industries led in the creation of 279,000 new jobs last month, bringing to nearly 3.8 million the number of jobs created during the year, the most since 1984's total of 3.95 million, the department said. Economists said inflation remains a threat. `` It shows that the economy has not shifted to a lower gear,'' said economist <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Brimmer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting service. `` With the economy continuing to operate at these levels and continuing to grow as rapidly as it is, inflation is going to keep creeping up.'' `` The economy continues to grow robustly and wage rates are not accelerating very much right now,'' said Washington-based economist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. `` But I still think there is higher inflation ahead, perhaps in spite of this report and not because of it. We could get a big jolt in inflation in January.'' When <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in January 1981, unemployment was 7.5 percent. It rose to 10.8 percent late in the 1981-82 recession, the highest level in four decades, before beginning to decline. The number of workers employed part-time because they can not find full-time work also was unchanged over the past year, remaining at 5.3 million. An alternate jobless rate that includes in the labor force the 1.7 million members of the armed forces stationed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was also 5.3 percent last month, unchanged from November. The dollar rose sharply for a third straight day as traders interpreted comments by a West German official as being bullish for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, said the West German central bank had not intervened recently to influence exchange rates. Dealers took that to mean the bank would not try to limit the dollar's rise. But the German central bank and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> did sell dollars on Friday. The dollar's rise helped support bond prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond gained 21-32 point, or about $ 6.50 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 9.03 percent from 9.08 percent on Thursday.

 Concerns about <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s intentions over the next six months remain evident in the oil futures market, but overall investors remain confident. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the February contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, rose 13 cents to close at $ 17.55 a barrel Friday. The contract recovered on Thursday to post a gain of 34 cents after losing 28 cents on Wednesday. Analysts noted that although investors have appeared optimistic that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> would stick to its new six-month production agreement prices for contracts between March and June showed only small gains of between 5 cents and 6 cents a barrel. `` Although there has been a steady growth in confidence, prices still favor the near-buy months,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, `` so confidence erodes as the months go out.'' The 13-member cartel agreed late last year to cut back production to 18.5 million barrels a day starting Jan. 1 from over 22 million barrels a day. A worldwide oversupply of oil has kept crude prices weak. Since the accord was announced, prices have risen from around the $ 13 level. Among refined products traded on the exchange Friday, domestic heating oil futures closed narrowly mixed. Analysts said cold weather has not affected heating oil prices significantly because of adequate supplies and forecasts of warmer weather. The February contract for home heating oil closed 0.13 cent higher at 53.60 cents a gallon after rising 0.82 cent in Thursday's session Other contract months ended the day mixed. Gasoline futures followed crude oil, with the February contract settling 0.32 cent higher at 47.72 cents a gallon. Other contract months also ended mixed.
