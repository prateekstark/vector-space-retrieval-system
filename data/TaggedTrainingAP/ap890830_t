 The drug control strategy President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will present next week will call for $ 250 million to $ 260 million in economic and military aid for the three principal cocaine producing countries _ <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> _ an administration source said Wednesday. Earlier, sources had said that aid figure could hit $ 300 million, and national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> indicated Tuesday that the figure would be even higher than that. When asked about the reported $ 300 million figure for the Andean countries, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said, `` That figure, I think you can assume, has already been increased by the fact that we have given <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> $ 65 million'' to help it fight the `` total war'' declared by the drug traffickers there. However, the $ 65 million is coming out of a discretionary fund available for fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. The strategy covers fiscal 1990. Scowcroft had not intended to add the $ 65 million onto next year's budget, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with his top lieutenants in the drug war Tuesday at his vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, to discuss the strategy, but sources said Wednesday that the focus of the meeting was <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, not the strategy, and that no specific decisions were made on changing plans for future aid to that country. `` The fundamental issues of the strategy, <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> did not change,'' one of the sources said, noting that the final strategy had gone to the printer before the meeting took place. The source declined to be named publicly. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has suffered numerous bombings by drug traffickers since Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> imposed emergency regulations 1 -LCB- weeks ago that allow for the immediate resumption of extraditions of alleged drug traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for trial. Last Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would give <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> $ 65 million in military equipment such as helicopters, in addition to some $ 2.5 million for protection for the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> judiciary that had been promised previously. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year set aside $ 5 million for such protection. Colombian Justice Minister <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> asked Tuesday for $ 19 million in aid for judicial protection. Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> met for about 40 minutes Wednesday with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> who developed the draft strategy, said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. `` She expressed appreciation for what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was doing and they agreed this was not a problem that was going to be solved quickly,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. `` She said that the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government was in it for the long haul and that she certainly hoped the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue its support.'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> would not comment on the report that the strategy called for a total of some $ 250 million to $ 260 million for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on Wednesday proposed a plan to create `` debt-for-drugs'' swaps to help reduce coca cultivation. The plan calls for trading debt relief to governments in coca-producing nations in exchange for their commitments to fund specific crop substitution and coca eradication programs. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> are the chief coca-growing countries, while <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is the main cocaine trafficking country, exporting about 80 percent of the world's cocaine. The drug strategy, meanwhile, will urge states to impose tough laws against drug users, but wo n't threaten to withhold highway funds from those states that fail to do so, as the draft strategy had proposed, an administration source said Wednesday. In addition, a proposed $ 25 million <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, to be run jointly by the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, was eliminated from the strategy due to a last-minute bid by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to develop a money-laundering intelligence center and combine all the elements, the source said. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> objected to the sudden change of plans. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, quoting <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sources in its Thursday editions, reported that the plan will focus on arresting middle-level figures like pilots, couriers and money handlers. Although the government has been trying for years to identify and arrest middle-level workers, it has not concentrated resources in this area, the Times said. The officials said the effort would be a major change from the current emphasis on going after the leaders of international drug organizations, by trying to seize drugs at the border and by eradicating coca leaf cultivation. However, most of the elements included in the draft strategy _ the emphasis on targeting drug abusers who fuel the drug traffic, the hiking of funds for drug treatment by 49 percent and the need for massively increased aid to the Andean countries _ remain the same as proposed originally by <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the source said. In <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the vacation White House press office announced that a new program allowing judges to strip student loans and other federal benefits from drug offenders starts Friday. The vacationing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a report on Wednesday spelling out how the penalties will work in both state and federal courts. Those convicted of drug trafficking or possession can be denied federal grants, student loans, contracts, and professional and commercial licenses, but not welfare, disability or Social Security benefits. The decision to deny any or all of an individual's benefits rests solely with the sentencing judge, except for those convicted of a third drug trafficking offense. For them, permanent denial of the benefits is mandatory. The penalties can be applied to convictions occurring after Friday for offenses occurring on or after Nov. 18, 1988. Next Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will go on radio and television to describe his new national drug strategy that is expected to stiffen penalties for individual users.

<HEAD>China Acts To Reassert Controls Over Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 The official press reported Thursday that the government is taking new steps to re-establish order in an economy reeling from speculation and profiteering in scarce materials and widespread tax evasion. The steps include measures to reassert controls over the distribution and pricing of raw materials such as coal and steel, the reports said. The state will also begin a campaign against what it says is rampant tax evasion among <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 14.5 million privately owned enterprises, the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Xie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mingan </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION>, said the state will tighten controls on prices of some raw materials such as coal, rolled steel and non-ferrous metals. He said redundant middlemen will be eliminated, illegal dealers and officials trading power for money will be disciplined and state supplies of materials to production enterprises will be maintained. One aspect of the economic reforms _ decentralization of controls over raw materials _ has led to hoarding, speculation and price-gouging. Middlemen, often with links to influential party and government officials, buy up scarce materials at low government-set prices and sell them for huge profits on free markets. <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> <PERSON> Xin </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, told a conference Wednesday that if the problem of tax evasion among private businessmen goes unsolved, `` it will certainly sap the morale of the dominant working classes and bring adverse effects on the enthusiasm of intellectuals.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s conservative leadership has singled out private entrepreneurs as an example of unhealthy disparities in income levels. Many private businessmen, some operating from simple street stalls, earn more in a day than a worker or teacher makes in a month. A young worker earns about $ 27 a month. <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> said the state was not trying to add to the financial burdens of private businessmen, who have been a stimulus in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic growth over the past decade. He also promised no change in the preferential terms on taxation for foreign investors in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s parliament, was also told Wednesday that more than 2,800 companies lost their business licenses and nearly 800 party and government officials were punished after the government began a drive against shady business practices in October The moves come against the backdrop of a return to Marxist orthodoxy in the political sphere following the military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in June and a general reassessment of the pace of the nation's market-oriented economic reforms.

 A man convicted of the 1977 rape and murder of a 61-year-old woman was executed Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s electric chair <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Waye </PERSON>, 34, was pronounced dead at 11:05 p.m. after receiving two 55-second jolts of nearly 2,500 volts of electricity, said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>. `` I would express that what is about to take place is a murder,'' <PERSON> Waye </PERSON> said in a final statement. `` I do n't hate anyone. I forgive everyone involved.'' <PERSON> Waye </PERSON> went to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> earlier Wednesday seeking a stay of execution, but the high court refused by a 7-2 vote to postpone the execution and to consider his case on appeal. <PERSON> Waye </PERSON>, a former textile worker, also was denied clemency earlier Wednesday by Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> has said <PERSON> Waye </PERSON> should not be executed because he is borderline mentally retarded. <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> has received 638 letters opposing the execution, largely due to a letter campaign urged by the human rights group. <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, in letters Wednesday to <PERSON> Waye </PERSON>'s attorneys, said he had reviewed <PERSON> Waye </PERSON>'s case and `` I am not persuaded that the governor's power of executive clemency should be exercised in this matter. <PERSON> Waye </PERSON> received communion of bread and juice Wednesday night from a boyhood schoolmate, the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, and the Revs. <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> A.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Epps </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Coble </PERSON>, operations officer at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Waye </PERSON> was baptized Tuesday night. `` He said to tell the people, ` I am blessed,''' <PERSON> Coble </PERSON> said. `` He's relying on his religious faith at this time,'' <PERSON> Coble </PERSON> said. `` He's savoring the time he has with his family.'' <PERSON> Waye </PERSON>'s mother, brother, two sisters and other relatives visited him Wednesday. <PERSON> Waye </PERSON> was the eighth person to die in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s electric chair since the state reinstituted the death penalty in 1977, and the 117th executed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1976 allowing reinstatement of capital punishment. Earlier Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> denied a stay of execution based on claims of <PERSON> Waye </PERSON>'s diminished mental capacity. Monday he denied a stay on claims that the trial jury was given faulty instructions. <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON>'s rulings were upheld Wednesday afternoon by a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which heard arguments via conference call, said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrer </PERSON>, a spokesman for Attorney General <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>. <PERSON> Waye </PERSON>'s attorneys contended the condemned man should be spared the death penalty because of new evidence showing he has `` a very seriously damaged brain.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, a lawyer from the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> Legal and Educational Defense Fund in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, told the appeals panel <PERSON> Waye </PERSON> was deprived of an adequate psyciatric evaluation when he was tried in 1978. He also said <PERSON> Waye </PERSON>'s previous attorneys failed to adequately investigate <PERSON> Waye </PERSON>'s psychiatric condition. Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Linwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> argued that the defense was legally barred from raising such objections, which should have been raised at trial or in earlier appeals. <PERSON> Waye </PERSON> was convicted of the Oct. 14, 1977, rape and murder of <PERSON> Lavergne </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, whose nude body was found in a bathtub. Her face was beaten beyond recognition, and she had been stabbed 42 times with a butcher knife. The killer had poured laundry bleach on the body. Shortly after the killing, a man who identified himself as <PERSON> Waye </PERSON> called police to tell them he had killed a woman, according to trial testimony. Police picked up <PERSON> Waye </PERSON> at his home and said he led them to the farm house where Mrs. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> lived alone. <PERSON> Waye </PERSON>'s court-appointed attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wellons </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, did not dispute that <PERSON> Waye </PERSON> committed the crime. However, he pleaded for a verdict on a lesser charge than capital murder. <PERSON> Waye </PERSON> could be the last person executed in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. The State Penitentiary is scheduled to close by June 30, 1990, and the electric chair will be moved to a new prison in <LOCATION> Greensville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.

 Funeral services were held Wednesday for a black man whose shooting death by police sparked two days of rioting and looting in <LOCATION> Vineland </LOCATION> while a special panel convened on how to calm racial tensions. Community leaders had hoped the unrest following the Sunday night shooting had subsided, but four people were arrested Wednesday, including a man who scuffled with a television news crew, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tofanelli </PERSON>, a city spokesman. The WPVI-TV news crew from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> was attacked by a group of youths as they interviewed people in downtown <LOCATION> Vineland </LOCATION>, where rioting and looting broke out Monday night, <PERSON> Tofanelli </PERSON> said. News reporter <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> was listed in stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> Newcomb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vineland </LOCATION> with a broken nose and facial injuries, hospital officials said. A cameraman and sound technician were treated for minor injuries and discharged. `` I feel no animosity toward those youngsters out there,'' <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said in a telehone interview. `` There is a lot of frustration ... a lot of anger here.'' <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s wallet and some television equipment were stolen. The equipment was returned later, <PERSON> Tofanelli </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, 23, was arrested on assault and robbery charges, <PERSON> Tofanelli </PERSON> said, and three other people were arrested in a separate incident when they disobeyed police orders to leave the area. The charges were not available. About 200 people packed into <ORGANIZATION> Truth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newfield </LOCATION> for a two-hour ceremony in remembrance of 26-year-old <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who was shot and killed by <LOCATION> Vineland </LOCATION> police on Sunday. Mayor <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> met with community leaders and announced the formation of an eight-member special task force to find ways of restoring calm to the city. `` We're hoping this will be the first step,'' <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> said at an informal press conference at his City Hall office. `` We're hoping that we can be assured there wo n't be any more outbreaks.'' <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, president of the local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People, thought the unrest would end with the memorial service. `` They're grieving, but I do n't think it's going to be a destructive type of thing,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. Mourners gathered outside the small white church in <LOCATION> Newfield </LOCATION>, about several miles north of <LOCATION> Vineland </LOCATION>, as the coffee-colored casket containing <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' body was led to a black hearse. They raised clenched fists in a symbol of black power as a choir sang `` Oh How I Love Jesus.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' body was taken to a funeral home and then to the state medical examiner's office in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> for a second autopsy. An initial autopsy was performed Monday by the county coroner. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a father of two children, was shot after he allegedly threatened officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON> with a steel rod, said police Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who was wanted on drug and weapons charges, was spotted by officers after police received an anonymous telephone call about a man on a bicycle carrying drugs, <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON> said. After being told he was under arrest, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> picked up the rod and approached <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON>, swinging, <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON>, who is white, fired two shots at <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, hitting him both times, the police chief said. <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON> has been taken off street duty and put on special assignment. The mayor said he did not plan to follow the demands of some blacks who want <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON> suspended without pay pending the outcome of an investigation by the state Attorney General's office. <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> said the task force would review the police department's relationship with the mostly minority community as well as the handling of citizen complaints He said a report was expected in about 30 days.

 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> officials are hoping to boost tourism by telling <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION> residents that summers are better in the Sweat Belt. The <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> plans to spend $ 250,000 on advertising in cities along <LOCATION> Interstate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> 75 </LOCATION>, which ends in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said. The ads will target <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, she said. `` We know there are a lot of Floridians who went to school in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, worked in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, have family in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. They're our main target,'' bureau director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Savich </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` If we can get the average Floridian who by July has had months of hot, muggy weather, we'll be happy to get them, too,'' he said. Tourism is <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s second-largest industry following manufacturing, worth $ 16 billion a year. Most tourists come from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region, though. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> wants to become a national tourism draw. The ads will use themes like, `` Come up to the cool <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> summers,'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said.

 Call it the `` wheel of misfortune.'' That's what a woman feels about the popular television game show after receiving prizes she says were used, filthy and damaged. `` I just wanted to go on ` Wheel of Fortune' and have a good time,'' said <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuker </PERSON>, 30, who appeared on the show 15 months ago. `` And I did have a good time _ it was a lot of fun. `` Now, all the problems have kind of ruined it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Stuker </PERSON> said her winnings included a $ 4,200 jukebox that arrived at her northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> home used, dirty and with parts missing. She also said the sparkling $ 10,000 blue canopied dinghy she picked out turned up with a broken windshield, cracks in the fiberglass, splotches of tar on the hull and dirty, torn upholstery. A representative of the <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> Enterprises show said officials are working on the complaints. The representative declined to give her name. Mrs. <PERSON> Stuker </PERSON> was the show's big winner for two days, garnering $ 36,829 worth of prizes including a Jeep, a sailboat, a small motorboat, artwork, sportswear and sporting equipment. She and her husband, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, forfeited some items they did n't want, but still got hit for $ 1,300 in federal and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state taxes on the prizes `` We got the Jeep, and it was nice _ we traded it in for a van,'' <PERSON> Stuker </PERSON> said. `` We got the TV and the VCR and some other nice things.'' But then the jukebox and the boat arrived. The couple's lawyer, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, has a file of letters indicating the Stukers' repeated attempts to have the problem corrected. The Stukers refused the game show's offer of $ 2,500 in cash in lieu of the $ 4,200 jukebox. The show took back the boat but has n't offered a replacement `` We do n't want to be greedy but anybody in their right mind would want this stuff if they had it coming to them,'' <PERSON> Stuker </PERSON> said.

 The last <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> beach closed by an oil spill in June was prepared for reopening today as state crews plowed oil-soaked sand. Mackerel Cove in <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION> had been closed since the June 23 accident involving the Greek tanker World Prodigy. The tanker spilled about 300,000 gallons of home heating oil into <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> when it ran aground at <LOCATION> Brenton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>, about a mile south of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> and five miles from Mackerel Cove. The spill caused most <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> beaches to be closed about a week, but Mackerel Cove, the hardest-hit of the beaches, remained closed because oil had soaked into the sand. State environmental workers have been harrowing the sand to expose the oil to air so it can evaporate. The department decided to bulldoze the rest of the contaminated sand instead of turning it because it is now a manageable amount, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Segerson </PERSON>.

 The vacation was 14 days old and the standings were: Fish-14, President Bush-0. The presidential patience appeared to be wearing thin. Sure he was worried about the drug lords in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and the civil war in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But the other thing bugging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he relaxed on the coast of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> was why the heck could n't he catch a fish. Despite daily excursions in his speedboat <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> _ sometimes twice daily _ to ply the ocean off his seaside home, the president failed to reel one in. He tried all kinds of lures and a variety of fishing partners _ from grandchildren to visiting dignitaries _ but still came up with an empty line. He canceled an afternoon of golf Sunday in favor of a fishing jaunt, and on Monday morning decided to forgo his 6:30 a.m. jog to try again. On the advice of longtime fishing buddy <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Boilard </PERSON> the president even ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to keep extraneous boats, including the small flotilla of press chase boats, 500 feet away on the theory that the vessels might be scaring off the fish. Still no luck. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried not to show dismay, and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claimed the president was n't bothered a bit. But there were signs it was getting to be something of a sore subject. `` The fishing's been lousy,'' he confided to reporters at the end of the first fishless week. `` I fish every single day and have n't got one. Eventually there were inklings of a Hemingwayesque obsession, as he talked of having a `` rendezvous with bluefish.'' He laid down a decree: `` I guarantee there will be fish caught.'' When he learned that an 18-pounder was caught off one of the TV crew boats tailing <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>, he could barely contain his envy. `` Eighteen pound bluefish?'' he repeated several times. `` Out there with us? There's no justice here. That's just not fair.'' Meanwhile, word was spreading fast about the fishless vacation. The <ORGANIZATION> Portland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> came out with a front page graphic called Fish Watch, featuring a picture of a circled fish with a line drawn across it and the statistics on how many days <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has fished without a catch. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> piloted his boat into town one day, a local fisherman gave him a large fish, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> grudgingly agreed with the press corps that this seemed the only way he could hook one. Evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s weekend house guest, told a local church congregation the president took him along on a fishing trip as a <PERSON> Jonah </PERSON>, a reference to the biblical figure who was swallowed by a whale. The president laughed and nodded when a reporter asked if he would have <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> bless his fishing rods. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has previously espoused a philosophical viewpoint on fish-free vacations, saying the fun was more in the fishing than the catching. But this trip, the situation seemed a bit much to take. By Monday both the president and his staff were trying to put the best face on his bad luck streak. That morning presidential photographer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> caught six fish on the president's boat and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> caught one that he described by extending his hands about two feet. White House spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanca </PERSON> later said diplomatically, `` Under the president's careful tutelage, the fishing trip was successful ... The fish were caught under his strong leadership.'' When reporters came upon him later at the golf course, the president also took the cheery tack. `` We did it today,'' he said. But when asked if `` we'' meant he too had caught a fish, he quipped, `` I was so busy trying to make General Scowcroft feel at home there ... we did well today.'' By the time Scowcroft finished beating his boss at golf, a game <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has vowed to improve on this vacation, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was directing all questions about golf and fishing to him. `` Brent, they want to talk to you about this. I'm too grumpy,'' he said before darting off in his golf cart.

 Shoppers at the biggest supermarket chain in the <LOCATION> Baltimore-Washington </LOCATION> area are accustomed to getting advice from <PERSON> Odonna </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>, whether they want it or not. She is the consumers' ombudsman, advocate and confidante at <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, and what's good for customers turns out to be good, too, for the prospering chain, the country's 12th largest supermarket company. Twenty thousand times a year, customers write or call Mrs. <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> to ask for a recipe, to request that stores stock an old familiar brand or to complain about the checkout clerk who put the eggs at the bottom of the bag. When Giant started selling live lobsters, two customers asked for a merciful way to cook the crustaceans. Mrs. <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> consulted animal rights people, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquarium </ORGANIZATION> and the fish industry and wrote into a guidebook two alternative methods _ severing the spinal cord or starting out with cool water. The experts said lobsters feel less pain than when they are plunged into boiling water. On Giant's commercials, Mrs. <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> brims with advice. She tells how to combat cholesterol, compare costs of different brands or opt for healthful snacks -LRB- `` choose pretzels, plain or fruit-filled shredded wheat or matzo.'' -RRB- `` Lower The Fat,'' urges a sign over the stores' meat counters. `` Choose chicken. Remove the skin. Eat more white meat than dark.'' On the shelves, green arrows point out foods that are high in fiber or low in fat and cholesterol. Three ounces of meat in a serving is really enough, Mrs. <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> advises budget-minded shoppers. `` Slice the meat thinly and fan it out on the plate.'' `` Everyone in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area can tell you who <PERSON> Odonna </PERSON> is,'' says <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professionals </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 1,000 firms that employ consumer advisers. `` Not many of them have her kind of recognition.'' The only woman among 22 Giant vice presidents, Mrs. <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> says she is free `` to openly disagree with company policies when they are not in the consumers' best interest.'' She pestered Giant's bakers until they finally agreed to forswear highly saturated palm and coconut oils in baked goods, except for in whipped toppings _ and she's working on those. `` Some people think I'm a pain in the neck,'' she says. `` If I am, I'm doing my job.'' Another idea came from <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION>'s consumer board, on which customers volunteer to serve. At their urging, she pressed Giant to create one checkout lane in each store with no candy to tempt kiddies. The chocolate industry protested in vain, she says. In an interview in Giant's nothing-fancy corporate headquarters in a warehouse neighborhood outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> spells out her philosophy: `` People are going to eat their hot dogs and their chocolate chips. But choices should be there. Consumers have the right to choose, and they have the right to be informed.'' A native of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, she started as an intern to the company's first consumer adviser, <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, who also served as consumer adviser to Presidents <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> `` Giant was ahead of the curve,'' says <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, who analyzes supermarket stocks for <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` The industry is just coming around to what <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION>'s been doing for years.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> says a third of 164 retailers who took part in a 1987 survey have consumer affairs departments. Forty percent of the consumer advisers report to top management. Analyst <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Walin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bache </ORGANIZATION> notes that what Mrs. <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> does is also good business. `` The costs are not that high and the goodwill between Giant and the community is great,'' she says. With 147 stores, <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> enjoys net profit margins of over 3 percent of sales _ well above the industry average of 0.71 percent. Giant's sales, near $ 3 billion a year, have doubled in eight years.

<HEAD>Grand Canyon Pollution Pits Federal Agency Against Federal Agency</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two federal agencies contend that a large <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> power plant, partly owned by another government agency, is polluting the skies over the Grand Canyon. But the operator of the plant, one of the nation's largest coal-burning electric facilities, criticizes the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> study. `` We designed and built the Navajo Generating Station to meet all air-quality standards,'' said A.J. `` Jack'' <PERSON> Pfister </PERSON>, general manager of the Salt River Project, which operates the plant near Page, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` The plant was located to assure that emissions would blow away from the Grand Canyon,'' he said Tuesday. The controversy pits the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> against the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 24.3 percent of the plant and would be responsible for much of the cost of expensive pollution controls. Costs estimates to control the pollution range from $ 300 million to $ 1 billion. The government has tried for years to determine to what extent the plant, 80 miles from the center of the Grand Canyon, is responsible for the layers of haze and pollution that cloud the skies during certain times of the year. The <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> defends its $ 2 million study tracking the plant's pollution and favors strong curbs. But the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION> sides with plant operators who argue the plant should n't be singled out for expensive pollution controls Both agencies are part of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Manual </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said Tuesday he was n't prepared to accept the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> conclusions, suggesting the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> conduct a review. That suggestion was widely seen as giving the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION> the upper hand. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that pollution from the 2,250-megawatt plant `` is a significant contributor to visibility impairment'' at the canyon. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> relied heavily on last year's six-week <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> study, in which plant pollutants were traced using a specially colored chemical. The <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said that during the study, an average 40 percent of the pollution could be traced to the plant, and that the figure reached 70 percent on some days. `` We have substantial evidence that the Navajo Generating Station is a significant contributor to the visibility problem,'' said <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> deputy administrator. `` Action must be taken now to protect the Grand Canyon.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said it would determine by February how sharp a reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions will be required. Curbs could force the plant to install expensive `` scrubbers'' or other technology. <PERSON> Pfister </PERSON> said he would go to court to stop any attempt to require installation of expensive pollution controls. The Salt River Project has put the possible cost as high as $ 1 billion, although other estimates are in the $ 300 million to $ 400 million range. About one-fourth of the bill could be sent to the government because of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION>'s partial ownership. The agency uses its electricity to pump water from the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to an irrigation project in central <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. The plant burns 24,000 tons of coal a day and releases an estimated 12 tons to 13 tons of sulfur dioxide from its 750-foot smokestacks hourly. Plant operators contend much of the pollution comes from other sources, including the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> freeways, and that a number of studies have shown that the plant is n't responsible for the canyon's visibility problems <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuhnke </PERSON>, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, and other environmentalists say they fear <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> will try to pressure <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> into seeking only modest emission curbs because of the potential cost to the federal government. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, other owners of the plant are the Salt River Project, 22 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 14 percent; the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, 21 percent; the <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 11 percent; and <ORGANIZATION> Tucson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 8 percent.

<TEXT>
 Federal housing officials are refusing to fund a project approved over agency officials' objections by former Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> in his final days on the job, a source says. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> One </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> early this month it will not honor <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s decision to fund a project to develop a computerized listing of black entrepreneurs, said a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> source who spoke Tuesday on the condition of anonymity. One <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a Maryland-based company owned by a prominent black Republican couple, had requested $ 421,000 for the project. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> approved half of that Jan. 17, three days before he left <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> after heading the agency for eight years. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s approval came despite a 6-1 vote against the proposal by a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> review committee, which questioned the need for the listing. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> approved the funding through a technical assistance program over which he had authority, including the right to overrule objections from others in the agency. But his action appears at odds with sworn congressional testimony that he took no direct role in funding decisions. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> is scheduled to be the first witness when congressional hearings into influence-peddling, mismanagement and possible fraud at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration resume Sept. 15. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> can halt the project despite <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s approval because the department never entered into a contract with One <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Since there's no contract, we do n't need a reason to kill it,'' said the source. The One America project had been put on hold by new <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. Attempts to reach One <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> officials late Tuesday were unsuccessful. The telephone at the company was not answered. The company is owned by <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>. During the early 1980s, Mrs. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> headed a group of black Republicans known as the Council of 100 and also served on a White House commission on small business. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> is a former <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official and was the first black to serve on the National Labor Relations Board. Mrs. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in July, said she had not received any special treatment from the agency. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> has not returned calls seeking comment. In a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said that getting more blacks involved in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs was one of his greatest achievements at the agency but said politics played no part in his decisions. `` A lot of blacks got business and we certainly did n't ask them were they Republicans, Democrat, liberal or what,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Prescription Costs Vary</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A prescription that costs $ 28 in one community could sell for $ 2 in another, according to a private survey of drug prices that found wide variations nationally and even within communities. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that its survey found that prices differed by factors of up to 14-to-1 nationally and that costs typically vary by more than 25 percent from one pharmacy to another in the same town. Even bigger price differences were found between some brand-name medications and their generic substitutes, which on average cost half as much, the <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> said. One pharmacy had the city's highest cost, $ 36, for a brand name and the lowest, $ 9.75, for the generic. The findings confirm the wisdom of shopping around, and are especially important for older Americans, who account for 12 percent of the population but use 32 percent of all prescription drugs, <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It was possible that an older consumer could save more than $ 30 on a single prescription,'' the report said. `` For example, in one community a prescription for Procardia -LRB- heart medication -RRB- sold for $ 26.99 at one pharmacy and for $ 58.60 at another pharmacy in the area.'' The findings also have important implications for government and private health insurance programs, which could hold down spiraling costs by making sure beneficiaries get the lowest-priced medications, <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> said. The 42-state survey also looked at services offered by pharmacies and found somewhat higher drug costs at outlets that have special programs such as 24-hour operations, after-hour emergency service, free delivery, patient drug profiles and discounts. `` Since for many older consumers, these services can be as important as cost savings, and since many offered them ` at no additional cost,' consumers should ask about the services and any associated costs,'' the <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> said. The group used older volunteers to survey prices at 1,050 pharmacies between September 1987 and September 1988. The resulting study, which did n't identify specific towns or pharmacies, examined price differences among 165 communities on 15 drugs often prescribed to older Americans. While the pharmacies surveyed were not scientifically selected, the true range of prices can not be less than those found in the study, <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> said. The report said there were large state-to-state differences in drug costs, with <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> having the highest overall average prices and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> the lowest, but <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> could not immediately provide actual figures for the states. There were big differences within states as well. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, for example, the price for Dyazide, a medication for high blood pressure and extra fluid in the body, varied from $ 20 to $ 45 in six communities. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, one pharmacy had an average price of $ 15.88 for certain drugs surveyed while another had an average of $ 31.36. Drugs included in the survey were: Dyazide; <LOCATION> Procardia </LOCATION>; Slow-K and its generic, potassium chloride TR, used to treat the need for more potassium; Hydrodiuril and its generic, hydrochlorothiazide, for high blood pressure and extra fluid in the body; Isordil and its generic, isosorbide, for chest pain; Cardizem, chest pain; Lasix, and its generic, furosemide, for high blood pressure and extra fluid; Tenormin, high blood pressure; Inderal and its generic, propranolol, for high blood pressure and chest pain; and Tagamet, ulcers. The survey did not include <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new drug strategy is being adjusted to focus more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and two other <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations that are fighting cocaine cartels in the region. The crisis in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, with seven bombings Tuesday in the city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, was high on the agenda when the president met with top <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> officials at his <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> seaside retreat to complete the new anti-drug strategy to be unveiled next week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised `` to cooperate to the best of our ability'' with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s latest request for $ 19 million to protect judges from drug cartel death squads. He did not comment specifically on the request but said details were being worked out in discussions in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with a delegation of <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> officials headed by Justice Minister <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>. Because of the crisis there, `` <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is a new ingredient in the overall drug strategy,'' national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> told reporters `` the law is under siege in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and we must protect it every way we can.'' `` We must uphold the rule of law, and regrettably at this moment that requires intensive physical protection of our judges,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, her country's eighth justice minister in three years. The 32-year-old lawyer denied reports she had considered resigning in the face of death threats against her family, saying: `` The threats are out there, but I am satisfied with my protection right now. I am determined that the integrity of our justice system survives this crisis and I hope to play my full part in assuring this.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recommended Tuesday that Americans postpone non-essential travel to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> indefinitely and suggested that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens living there consider leaving. `` Although Americans have not yet been the target of any violence, visitors and Americans resident in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> should carefully re-evaluate whether it is essential that they travel to or remain in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> at this time,'' said the statement. `` The department believes it would be prudent for those who deem their presence non-essential to seriously consider leaving.'' Asked about reports that the anti-drug proposal will include $ 300 million for <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, Scowcroft indicated it will contain an `` Andean strategy'' to help these countries improve drug interdiction. He said the aid package was adjusted upward to include the $ 65 million that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced last week for the Colombian armed forces. Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> said the additional $ 19 million she sought would be used to buy armored cars, metal detectors and other security equipment to protect judges. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has already promised $ 5 million over two years to train Colombian security guards to protect the judges. `` While training and other such programs are useful, we also need to channel resources into such items as bulletproof cars -LRB- and -RRB- metal detectors,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it is ready to airlift military equipment to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> under the $ 65 million aid package as soon as it receives a list of materiel requested by <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. The crisis prompted cancellation of today's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., scratched the hearing after the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expressed fear that publicity would further jeopardize the lives of Colombian authorities <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the panel was told that `` because of the sensitive nature of the situation in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> at this time that it would not be appropriate to have an open hearing.'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> indicated that a review of emergency extradition decrees by the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> could delay <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to get custody of <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, who is wanted on money-laundering charges. But he said `` we have every hope and expectation of getting custody of Mr. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is seeking to extradite <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> under emergency extradition decrees promulgated this month. Extradition papers are being prepared for 12 other Colombians under federal indictment, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said, `` so that when someone is captured we would be in a position to have everything signed, sealed and delivered to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Judge Requires Labeling Rules by Oct. 30</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has until Oct. 30 to issue rules on tampon labeling aimed at preventing toxic shock syndrome, a federal judge says. `` This delay in issuing a tampon absorbency regulation is wholly unreasonable and unacceptable,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said Tuesday in issuing the deadline. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` has been lethargic in responding'' to its legal obligation, especially since the government has known about the danger for more than seven years. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McLearn </PERSON> declined to comment on the ruling. A revised <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> proposal issued in June would require tampon makers to prominently display one of six new standardized terms for absorbency ranging from low to highest. Under the proposal, tampon boxes would have to carry labels advising women to select the lowest absorbency needed to minimize risk of toxic shock syndrome. Toxic shock syndrome, or <ORGANIZATION> TSS </ORGANIZATION>, is a rare but sometimes fatal condition associated with tampon use. `` Women are unknowingly subjecting themselves to toxic shock syndrome simply because -LRB- government officials -RRB- drag their feet in ... standardizing tampon absorbency labels,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s opinion said. The opinion came in a lawsuit filed a year ago by <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit organization, to force the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to issue tampon-labeling regulations. Regulations have required a warning about <ORGANIZATION> TSS </ORGANIZATION> since 1982 but allow it to appear on a package insert. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has tried since 1981 to have manufacturers label tampons with a standardized absorbency rating. The agency tried unsuccessfully to get tampon makers to voluntarily standardize labeling, but began regulatory efforts in 1984. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s reasons for delay are `` lame at best and wholly irresponsible at worst.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is urging <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities to complete an investigation into the death of an Arab-American teen-ager and the disappearance of two other Americans. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said Tuesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to determine who killed a 14-year-old American-born youth in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> earlier this month. A report by a Scottish pathologist retained by the family of <PERSON> Amjad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON> said the youth was killed by a single gunshot wound. <PERSON> Amjad </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, but lived in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> for the last four years. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had been in close touch with the youth's family, as well as with relatives of two other Americans of Palestinian origin who have been reported missing for more than 10 days in Israeli-held territory. `` We certainly understand the tragedy of the situation and their agony,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. `` We've been talking to their families. We've been following up with the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities We urge the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities to conduct a full investigation.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also condemned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s expulsion of five Palestinians on Sunday. The expulsions brought to 60 the number of Arabs deported for their alleged role in organizing the 20-month uprising against Israeli rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` We deplore these latest deportations,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. `` These measures corrode the atmosphere within which the peace process must be moved forward and make it more difficult for Israelis and Palestinians to engage in constructive dialogue.''

 The World Tourism Organization voted to put off consideration of a membership application by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s self-declared state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> until the organization meets again in 1991. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, supported by <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, forced the vote Tuesday to delay the membership consideration afer daylong discussions. The vote was by secret ballot. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort was led by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for international organizations, who said he was `` very gratified'' by the outcome. The vote was 40-34 to postpone the issue, with six absentees, six abstentions and five blank votes.

<TEXT>
 A Havana-born Republican state senator rode heavy support from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Hispanic community Tuesday to become the first Cuban-American elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, winning the seat held by the late <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> for nearly three decades. With all precincts reporting in the ethnically divisive race, state Sen. <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, 37, received 49,638 votes, or 53 percent, to 43,759, or 47 percent, for Brooklyn-born attorney <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>. The 48-year-old Democrat, who is Jewish, had been making his first run for elective office. The race was made necessary by Pepper's death May 30 at 88. Pepper, a Democrat, had held the seat since its inception 27 years ago The 93,000-plus turnout was nearly 51 percent, far higher than normal for a special election and higher than election officials' 43 percent projection. The outcome was delayed more than an hour late Tuesday by a <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> elections computer problem that temporarily halted vote-counting. Higher final counts for both candidates were revised early Wednesday because of the counting problems. The unofficial returns indicated that predominantly Hispanic precincts, with turnouts of more than 60 percent, boosted Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> with 80 to 90 percent margins, while <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> was favored by margins of 80 to 90 percent in predominantly black or non-Latin white precincts. In her victory speech, Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> said she wanted to unify and heal the community and `` provide leadership ... which is based on acaring conscience and conservative convictions. `` We do not have the luxury to waste time on divisive politics,'' she told cheering supporters at the Airport Hilton Hotel. `` We must focus on what we have in common and not ponder on the negative.'' <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, addressing disappointed supporters at the Clarion Castle Hotel in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, said, `` We have done incredibly well and we did it on a positive theme.'' He said Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> outspent him and had campaign help from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>. The Democrat, noting that more Hispanics turned out than blacks or non-Hispanic whites, said, `` We've got to get everyone in this community to get out and exercise their right to vote. If that had happened, we would have won tonight.'' The Democrats, mindful that August is vacation month for many <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> residents, had tried to build an absentee-vote margin for <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>. But election officials said <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> had only 3,933 absentee votes to 3,599 for Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>. The victory gave the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> an 11-8 majority in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation, and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> called it a Republican milestone in the South `` That seat has been a Democratic seat since it was created,'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` For us to win it is a major victory.'' Democratic Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who campaigned for <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, expressed disappointment in a statement issued by his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, but said, `` The Democrats ran a surprisingly competitive race after an admittedly divisive primary.'' Ethnic-bloc campaigning dominated the short, tense race between Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> for the remaining 14 months of Pepper's term <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> had come under fire for declaring, `` This is an American seat.'' <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> had hoped to capitalize on the 30,000-plus edge that Democrats, mostly blacks, Jews and retirees, hold in registration. Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> looked to the Hispanic community, which makes up 40 percent-plus of the vote. Polls in the final week of the race had indicated it was too close to call. ` It's been a very controversial election,'' said <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Elections Supervisor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>. `` There has been a tremendous amount of media exposure, and we think both camps are getting a lot more people out to vote.'' Pepper's seat was one of five openings in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House. The others were caused by the resignations of <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and the deaths of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Miss., in plane Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> had refused to appear with <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> during the campaign, charging his `` American seat'' message was bigoted. However, the same charges were made against her campaign over a Spanish-language mailing that urged Hispanics to show how American they were even though they were n't born in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and did n't speak English like <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>'s said his `` American seat'' remark was an appeal to voters to decide on qualifications, not birthplace. He also said it was a response to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s statement that the party wanted to elect a Cuban-American.

<HEAD>Financial Picture Brighter for Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers are showing further financial gains this year, with the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reporting higher net income and a growth in farm assets because of rising land values. Those are national figures and do n't reflect the farmers who are n't making it financially because of lingering effects of last year's drought or burdensome debt they are unable to handle. Even so, a preliminary report said Tuesday, farm asset values should rise 4 percent to 6 percent this year to a range of $ 780 billion to $ 790 billion from around $ 750 billion last year. `` Rising real estate values are driving this increase,'' the report said. `` Debt levels will probably be unchanged from last year.'' Cash receipts from larger crops this year are boosting net farm income more sharply than had been expected. Nationally, it said, net farm income could rise more than 10 percent this year to between $ 48 billion and $ 53 billion, $ 1 billion more than forecast in July. Last year's net income was around $ 44 billion, and the record was $ 47 billion in 1987. As used by the agency, net farm income includes the value of agricultural production whether sold or stored on the farm, allowances for family dwellings and other adjustments, minus total operating expenses. In another method of accounting, the report said this year's net cash income `` could fall from last year's record $ 60 billion.'' Net cash income does not include changes in inventory values and is simply gross cash income during the year minus cash operating expenses. Economists said cash receipts from the sale of crops and livestock are expected to rise $ 2 billion to $ 10 billion this year, more than offsetting a decline in direct government payments to farmers. Total expenses are likely to go up 3 percent to 6 percent. About one-third of the expected gain can be attributed to larger costs of expanded crop acreage this year. But short-term interest rates also are going up, although long-term interest rates are continuing to fall as old debt is paid off. Overall, interest expenses are expected to rise by more than 10 percent this year. `` Wheat and corn receipts are expected to rise as much as 15 percent this year, following sizable gains last year'' the report said. `` Vegetable receipts are also expected to rise. Soybeans, however, probably will see falling receipts as higher domestic production and record foreign output lead to a 25 percent decrease in prices.'' Total livestock and poultry receipts should see a modest rise, but hogs could be the only livestock group facing a drop, the report said. Although the decline in 1989 hog receipts is expected to be small _ less than $ 500 million _ it will be on top of a $ 1 billion reduction in 1988.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s price support for soybeans grown this year will be reduced 5 percent to $ 4.53 per bushel from $ 4.77 in 1988, the maximum reduction allowed by law. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Tuesday that was a preliminary decision and that the final 1989 soybean support rate would be announced by Oct. 1. Department economists have forecast that soybean prices market during the 1989-90 marketing year beginning Sept. 1 may average $ 4.75 to $ 6 per bushel, compared with $ 7.35 in the current year. Under the price-support program, farmers can take out <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> loans and then have the option of repaying them if market prices are significantly higher when the loans are due. If prices are down, producers have the option of turning their crop over to the government, settling the debt. Soybean production is expected to be up sharply this year to an estimated 1.9 billion bushels from 1.54 billion in 1988 when drought reduced yields. The reduction in the support rate was required by a formula in the 1985 farm law. Supports will be 75 percent of the average of season prices received by farmers during the preceding five years, not counting the high and low years. But the law says the support can not be cut more than 5 percent in any single year and in no event can be lowered below $ 4.50 per bushel. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> also said a `` marketing loan'' program wo n't be in effect for soybeans this year. A marketing loan program would allow producers to repay their price support loans at the prevailing world market price or at the loan rate, whichever is lower.

<HEAD>Voters in Four Counties Vote for Riverboat Gambling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Voters in four eastern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> counties approved riverboat gambling that would allow floating casinos to dock in their areas. In <LOCATION> Scott </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the largest of the four counties voting on the riverboat gambling initiative, the measure was approved by 23,999 votes, or nearly 60 percent, to 16,102, or 40 percent. `` A victory means this community has basically said ` come on in,''' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, coordinator of Citizens for Riverboat Gambling in <LOCATION> Scott </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` It sends a message to developers and the Racing and <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that we will support riverboat gambling if the commission wants it to come here,'' she said. `` I think it's an exciting concept.'' But the Rev. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> VanderJagt </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Newcomb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Davenport </LOCATION>, was n't happy with the result. `` We're disappointed, surely,'' he said. `` We certainly are n't going to be poor sports about it `` This was an economic, moral and social issue. They are intertwined, whether you are talking about theft, compulsive gambling or prostitution. It sends the wrong signal.'' In <LOCATION> Muscatine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, voters gave the measure 3,939 votes, or 54 percent, to 3,315, or 46 percent. The proposal enjoyed wide support in <LOCATION> Clinton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, with 7,903 `` yes'' votes and 4,929 `` no'' votes for a margin of victory of 62 percent to 38 percent. The spread was much closer in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>: 1,598 votes for to 1,496 votes against. Under a 1989 law, floating casinos may begin operation on <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> waterways aboard excursion boats April 1, 1991, but only in counties where voters have given approval. Two weeks ago the riverboat gambling initiative was rejected in the northeast counties of <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> and Allamakee while it passed in <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Last Tuesday, voters in <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> counties in southeast <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> approved a gambling proposal. Along the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Woodbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> supervisors have set a Sept. 26 referendum while petitions were being circulated in <LOCATION> Mills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The Legislature this year voted to authorize riverboat gambling, limiting betting to $ 5 per play and setting a $ 200 nightly limit on losses. Boats can offer blackjack, roulette, slot machines, dice games and video gambling. Passage of the issue is only a first step in the process. The <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will decide how many licenses to grant and where the boats will dock. Those decisions are not expected until next year.

 Far in the cold darkness beyond <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, a lonely Voyager speeds into the void, dozens of worlds in its wake as it leaves a legacy that may aid the survival of its home planet, a garden island in a sea of space. What wonders Voyager 2 witnessed as the one-ton spacecraft cruised the solar system, traversing an arc-shaped 4 -LCB- - billion-mile path in 12 years as it trekked past four planets and at least 56 moons: In 1979, <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> and its moon Io, a hellish satellite of sulfur-spewing volcanoes Saturn and its graceful rings in 1981. Five years later, Uranus, knocked on its side by some incomprehensible collision. And today, the probe is 5 million miles past deep blue <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, with its frozen volcanic moon <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, once flooded by seas of icy lava. Such marvels, such sights never before seen by human eyes, were returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in 81,000 photographs captured by television cameras aboard Voyager 2 and its twin, <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> 1, which explored Jupiter and <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> before hurtling toward the stars. And what, one may ask, did these humble Voyagers, these piles of 1960s electronics, do for their human masters, for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayers who paid the $ 865 million to propel them to the outer planets? `` The immediate benefits of Voyager's pictures of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> and their wealth of scientific information is to stimulate our intellects and to nourish our souls,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and former director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. `` But surely over the coming generations those arcane facts will become relevant to our destiny on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, just as earlier arcane facts from <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> are now considered vital to our destiny.'' <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> astronomer <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> said: `` If you want to understand <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, go look at other worlds.'' From Mariner and the space probe Pioneer, scientists studied how <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>' thick clouds trap solar heat, warming the planet to 900 degrees in a runaway `` greenhouse effect.'' It helped alert scientists to how industrial air pollutants threaten to warm <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, flooding coastal areas and triggering droughts and starvation. <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON> first warned of depletion of Earth's ozone layer after using chemical formulas devised to help <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> understand <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>' atmosphere, <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> and other planetary scientists developed the theory that smoke from nuclear war could plunge Earth into a dark, cold nuclear winter and cause mass starvation of those who survived the exchange of warheads. `` The idea ultimately evolved from our attempt to understand the great Martian dust storm of 1971-72,'' which was detected by Mariner 9 and chilled Mars' already cold surface, <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> said. `` The lesson we're learning is that the complexity of the universe is something you'll never imagine without looking at it,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey geologist <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON> said Tuesday at a final news briefing on Voyager 2. At <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, Voyager discovered six moons in addition to Nereid and <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, which were first detected from Earth. It discovered three thin rings of debris and two broad rings orbiting the planet. It found at least six moonlets hidden in one ring. Voyager detected in <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s bluish atmosphere an Earth-size swirling storm called the Great Dark Spot, 720 mph winds, photochemical smog, invisible ultraviolet auroras and cirrus clouds of natural gas casting shadows on clouds far below. It also revealed two types of ice volcanoes on frosty, pinkish <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>: 1,000-foot-deep craters measuring hundreds of miles across that once produced ocean-size floods of ice flowing like lava, and volcanoes that may be active today, ejecting nitrogen ice 25 miles high at speeds of 560 mph. Scientists presented new findings Tuesday showing <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s weak, tilted magnetic field does n't go through the center of planet but is offset about four-tenths of the way toward the surface. That and other evidence suggest the liquid that generates the magnetic field may exist in a shallow spherical shell, not in a deep central core as inside the Earth. `` As exciting as the discoveries at <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> have been, this encounter has really just been the fourth and final planet that <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> has revealed in an unprecedented decade of discovery,'' said Voyager project scientist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>. `` For those of us fortunate enough to be involved, this has been the journey of a lifetime.'' Voyager 2 keeps looking back at <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> until Oct. 2. Then, like <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> 1, it will collect information about particles and magnetic fields in space and search for the edge of the solar system, sending Earth information until about 2020. Then, carrying copper videodisks of pictures and recorded sounds of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, the Voyagers will spend billions of years orbiting the center of the Milky Way. Perhaps one day, an alien civilization will find one of the Voyagers and play the record. They will hear a simple message recorded by a 7-year-old boy from another time and another world: `` Greetings from the children of the planet <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>.''

But <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, in office since July, said he would welcome direct talks with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> `` in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> or in any part of the world,'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> also said in the interview that he ruled out the possibility of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> forcefully trying to recover the Falklands, which it calls the <LOCATION> Malvinas </LOCATION> and has claimed since 1833. Their brief but bloody <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> war cost the lives of nearly 1,000 British and Argentine soldiers. `` This is completely ruled out, at least during my government. ... We will not use weapons to recover what we believe and are convinced is ours,'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> added that he would invite Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to the Argentine capital of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> if diplomatic relations between the two countries, which have been severed since the war, were restored, the paper reported. `` I am planning to do so if Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is willing to talk to me,'' it quoted him as saying. The exclusive interview was by Times correspondent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Llanos </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> but the paper did not say when it was conducted. There was no immediate reaction from Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government. But the British domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported without attribution: `` The view in <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- British government circles -RRB- is that if President <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s words and proposals are accurately represented, this is an attitude which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> welcomes. `` However, while his words will be studied closely in -LRB- Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s -RRB- Downing Street -LRB- office -RRB-, the feeling is that any British-Argentine dialogue should move forward one step at a time.'' Representatives of the two governments agreed during three days of talks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this month to hold a meeting of officials Oct. 17-18 in the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> to discuss proposed normalization of relations between the two nations. Similar talks in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, in July 1984 broke off over the issue of sovereignty, with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> refusing to discuss sovereignty of the islands and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> insisting it stay on the agenda. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government has consistently refused to discuss sovereignty. But <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> has dropped the insistence of the previous Argentine government headed by President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s sovereignty claim must be the first issue considered in normalization talks. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> invaded the Falklands 325 miles off its southeast coast in April 1982 but <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> sent a task force and recaptured them in a war that eventually led the Argentine junta, which had ruled harshly for nearly eight years, to relinquish power upon the election of <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> claims the windswept islands as an inheritance from the days of Spanish colonial rule and says the British, who have ruled them as a colony since 1833, stole the islands. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has never formally declared an end to hostilities with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since the 1982 war. Asked in the interview in The Times if he thought island sovereignty would be negotiated at any stage during his six-year term, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> was quoted as saying: `` It might, but it might not. We have waited 156 years -LRB- to recover the islands -RRB-. We can certainly wait a bit longer.'' Nearly 2,000 staunchly pro-British <ORGANIZATION> Falkland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> are fiercely opposed to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> ever gaining sovereignty. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> was quoted in the interview as saying that if full diplomatic relations between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> were restored, his government would allow airline flights and shipping services between <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and the Falklands. He was quoted as saying that this included the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> I, the Falklands' own merchant vessel that caused a stir in recent months by docking in neighboring ports in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> says will not talk about running for a sixth congressional term until he has cleared the air of the controversy caused by a male prostitute he once employed. When it was reported that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> had paid <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> for sex and then hired him to do household chores, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat said he did not believe the controversy should affect his political plans. But <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> has continued to allege that he procured sex partners for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> knew <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> was running a prostitution ring out of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, home, charges the congressman strongly denies. `` Before I have disposed of those charges, it's not fair for me to be saying, ` Hey I'm gon na run anyway,''' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday. `` I'm not going to talk about running again until I can get the forum to clear those up.'' The proper forum, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said, is the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee. On Monday he asked Chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., to investigate <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>'s allegations `` to ensure that the public record is clear. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has been re-elected since disclosing his homosexuality. But after the disclosure that he paid for sex, some Republican leaders called for his resignation. `` If everything <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> said was true I should resign,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` The focus should not be on my political career. It should be on the accuracy of these charges.'' <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> reportedly is looking for possible book and movie deals. He said he has received hundreds of messages on his telephone answering machine since his story appeared Friday in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` Just leave a message on my answering machine _ if you can find room on the tape,'' an early version of <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>'s message said. `` I'm an open person. I'll listen to all offers,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>, who will be 33 years old on Monday, has said that he was inspired to publicize his story by the television movie `` Mayflower Madam,'' about <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Biddle </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrows </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> madam who ran a high-class brothel. He told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that he was motivated by money and notoriety. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he believes greed is leading <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> to embellish his story. `` There seems to be some change in the story, and it seems someone told him that the more lurid the story, the more money there will be for him,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has said he employed <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>, who has a history of involvement with male prostitution and drugs, with hopes of reforming him. <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>'s number was published in the City Paper, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s weekly arts and entertainment guide, in an advertisement that offered `` Total Pleasure _ Full body massage will make you feel it Young, handsome masseur avail. by appt.'' Callers were greeted with background music of the'60s rock hit `` Light My Fire.'' <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> did not return a message left on his machine Tuesday, and his outgoing message was toned down: `` I will return your call as soon as possible or one of my associates will return your call as soon as possible.'' The congressman said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, the man he currently lives with, has been helping him through the ordeal of disclosure. `` He has made such an enormous difference in my life that this has been a tolerable experience,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. `` I only wish I met him five years earlier. He has provided emotional and intellectual support that make a big difference _ the absence of which contributed to the extent to which I was stupid personally earlier.''

 A flightless bird the size of a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> marathoner gave authorities a good run and kicked an animal control officer before police surrounded him and ended his two-hour escapade. The bird, a relative of the ostrich, fled in terror Tuesday after he was accidentally freed from his owner's back yard. The owner's sons and police chased the emu, named PeeWee, through streets in this seaside town southeast of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> until police finally surrounded him with a wire fence in a pasture. PeeWee was taken to <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grafton </LOCATION> and given three stitches for a cut in the neck. The bird was expected to go home today. Emus are flightless Australian birds with long legs and huge three-toed feet. Owner <PERSON> Myrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Borysenko </PERSON> estimated PeeWee to be more than 6 feet tall. <PERSON> Borysenko </PERSON> said he got the bird as a chick three years ago. He said PeeWee was friendly but not very smart. `` Once he's outside the back yard, he has no point of reference. If I'm in the yard he will recognize me. But if he's outside the yard, he gets spooked,'' said <PERSON> Borysenko </PERSON>, who is a doctor of immunology and anatomy. He said a neighborhood child probably opened the backyard gate, letting PeeWee loose. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Borysenko </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Justin </PERSON>, went to the front yard to collect the bird, but PeeWee became terrified and took off. `` As my son likes to say, as soon as he got out, his turbo kicked in and he was flying down the street,'' <PERSON> Broysenko </PERSON> said. At the town common, animal control officer <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> got a noose around PeeWee, but he leapt away and kicked her in the leg. `` His kick was about as hard as my horse could do, but I was n't hurt,'' she said After police surrounded him, animal rescuers took the bird to the medical center in a van. But <PERSON> Borysenko </PERSON> said his troubles are n't over. `` Now all I have to do is figure out how to get him home,'' he said. `` I guess I'll have to get a van.''

<HEAD>Highway Officials Back Off ``Friendship State''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Highway commissioners dropped plans to print `` The Friendship State'' on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> license plates and said they were at a loss for words following complaints that the slogan was n't tough enough <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dedman </PERSON> said Tuesday that he hoped a consensus could be reached on a positive slogan that would temper outsiders' views of Texans. `` We should do everything to say ` Y' all come' to visitors to the state and ` Y' all come in bringing hi-tech and other jobs,''' he Responding to an outpouring of criticism about the earlier decision to use `` The Friendship State,'' <PERSON> Dedman </PERSON> said perhaps `` Never give up'' should be the new slogan. As it is, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> plates next spring will remain sloganless, although more colorful with the red, white and blue state flag. On July 19, the three-member commission approved, with little fanfare, putting `` The Friendship State'' on the state's 27 million license plates, hoping the cheery message would attract tourists. Friendship is the official state motto and the word ` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' derives from the Spanish pronunciation of an Indian word meaning `` friends. But once word of the decision reached the public, thousands of Texans, prouder of their independence than their friendliness, jammed telephone lines to the highway department and radio call-in shows. Most said the slogan was too generic and bland. State Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor, called it `` wimpy.'' Republican gubernatorial candidate <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rains </PERSON> said it `` looked a little quiche and chablis.'' The most popular alternative was the `` Lone <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>,'' although some suggested more topical slogans, such as `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the Insolvent State,'' or `` The Bank Failure State.'' <PERSON> Dedman </PERSON> said there is a feeling outside the state, particularly in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has gotten what it deserved in the state's financial and energy collapse. During the 1970s Arab oil embargo, some Texans rode around with bumper stickers directed at `` <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>,'' saying `` Let them freeze in the dark.'' `` We should be collectively as a group of people as conscious as we can be of being good marketers to the rest of the nation and try to do whatever we can to overcome some of that perceived negative outlook toward <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dedman </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Amnesty International Demands China Stop `Judicial Killing'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said today that it has appealed to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government to `` stop using judicial killing'' as a way to suppress internal opposition. The human rights organization said it sent a telex message to Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> saying it feared the brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last June reflected an official policy of crushing peaceful opposition at any cost. Amnesty International did not release a text of its message to <PERSON> Li </PERSON>. However, the organization said it appealed for the release of all `` prisoners of conscience'' and for fair trials for all those facing political charges. The London-based organization, which opposes capital punishment in all countries, also called for an end to executions. In a report published today, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> estimated at least 1,000 people were killed when security forces moved against the demonstrators in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and elsewhere in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> from June 3-9, and that at least 300 more people were killed in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The government has said at least 200 died during the unrest. The statement also said, `` There was strong evidence that the authorities had taken a deliberate decision after the army massacres in early June to carry out secret executions, but also to publicize certain death sentences in order to cow political opposition. `` Some -LRB- detainees -RRB- are reported to have been severely beaten by police or soldiers and it is feared that detainees may still be put under strong pressure _ including the use of ill-treatment and torture _ to confess to crimes or to denounce others involved in the protests.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it expressed concern to <PERSON> Li </PERSON> about a directive reportedly approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s central committee in June which specifically directed that the number of persons executed or imprisoned were not to be made public. The report said <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> had been unable to confirm reports of mass executions. `` The atmosphere of terror following the military crackdown, which has seen a continuing wave of repression, including mass arbitrary arrests, summary trial and executions, has made it impossible for <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> to discover the true death toll,'' the report said. It asked however that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` stop using judicial killing as a political tool'' to suppress the opposition. About 4,000 people have been officially reported arrested. Amnesty said it believes the number is much higher and that many detainees `` may be prisoners of conscience held solely for the non-violent exercise of their fundamental rights.'' In its message to Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said, it inquired specifically about <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, a 24-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student who was at the top of a list of wanted student leaders published June 13. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> cited reports that <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> was badly beaten following his arrest, and included claims by a former policeman that the student leader was executed.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell against the Japanese yen today, and prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> declined sharply. The dollar closed at 143.08 yen, down 1.07 yen from Tuesday's close of 144.15 yen After opening at 142.86 yen, it ranged between 142.78 and 143.20 yen. Currency dealers said the dollar's fall was in response to its slide on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market Tuesday. `` The dollar's decline halted after it dipped into the 142-yen range, when everybody felt it had reached the lower end of its range,'' said a trader at a major commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Daiichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kangyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said the dollar was likely to remain within a narrow range until the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic data, including unemployment figures for August, on Friday. On the stock market, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 80.24-point gainer Tuesday, fell 215.99 points, or 0.61 percent, closing at 34,471.66. Dealers said trading was relatively dull as many institutional investors retreated to the sidelines after profit-taking outpaced small-lot buying. Among the few gainers were banks, including <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which announced plans on Tuesday to merge. Led by the two banks, other bank shares gained moderately, said a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, also speaking on condition of anonymity.

<DATELINE>ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lutherans grappled with the issue of abortion in an assembly that briefly adopted a resolution some considered pro-choice before delegates reconsidered and maintained a neutral position. As the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first legislative assembly neared its close today, it recognized that society was in a `` time of crisis'' about abortion, with `` mounting hysteria, fear, polarization and violence.'' The newly merged 5.3-million-member denomination settled on a resolution Tuesday that advised `` information, counseling and competent Christian guidance'' on abortion. This should be `` based in the Lutheran traditions of Biblical grounding and social and individual responsibility,'' the resolution said. The delegates avoided defining a position about abortion itself, leaving that for a two-year study on sexuality and decision by the next assembly in 1991. One delegate, <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, unsuccessfully sought a speeded up process for developing a stand on this `` excruciating, sensitive'' issue, adding, `` We must begin to lead or be led.'' The assembly reconsidered and rejected an orginally approved measure that many delegates interpreted as pro-choice. The Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinlicky </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, exclaimed during the debate, `` I will not obey this call for free access to abortion on demand.'' A nurse, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Reisner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, pleaded for retaining the original, saying `` pro-choice allows pro-life. The reverse is not true.'' To not permit it is `` taking away our freedom.'' In the end, delegates reinstated a revised version eliminating a phrase calling for provision of `` free access to services.'' Bishop <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chilstrom </PERSON>, church president, said that if the original was taken literally it would be contrary to previous church statements. The three denominations that merged into the new body had taken varying positions, one seeing human life as beginning at conception, another less definite about it, but both upholding the sanctity of unborn life. On another topic, the assembly urged `` loving care and compassion'' toward AIDS sufferers, saying they often have been `` met with apathy, indifference or even antagonism and denial.'' The church affirmed the `` rights and dignity of all persons living with AIDS,'' and pledged to include them `` in the life and worship of the church.'' Steps also were taken for fuller inclusion of youngsters in future assemblies, and to provide resources to meet needs of the deaf and other disabled, and also those whose primary language is not English.

<HEAD>EPA Review Condemns Proposed $500 Million Water Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HILLIARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Supporters of the proposed $ 500 million Two Forks dam reacted with anger after a five-month federal review condemned the water project as unnecessary and environmentally damaging. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> DeHihns </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> deputy regional administrator from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> who conducted the review, announced Tuesday that he was recommending the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> press on with efforts to kill the project. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that the decision was `` a classical example of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> bureaucratic arrogance that shows a full disregard for the competency and expertise of a host of federal, state and local agencies'' that supported the plan. `` You simply ca n't leave us high and dry,'' Mayor <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday in reaction to DeHihns' announcement. `` We have not been given a fair, objective appraisal of this project.'' The 615-foot-high dam to be built 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> near the confluence of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fork </LOCATION> would flood 30 miles of scenic river valley and canyon and the town of <LOCATION> Deckers </LOCATION>, which has fewer than 100 residents. `` The Two Forks dam and reservoir project would result in the loss of a major aquatic resource which provides irreplaceable stream fishery habitat and recreational resources near the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> metropolitan area,'' <PERSON> DeHihns </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> president, said <PERSON> DeHihns </PERSON> deserves `` the heartfelt praise and gratitude of all concerned Americans'' for his balanced review. `` His finding that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> should proceed with a veto of this project is a major victory in the continuing battle to protect the world class wildlife habitat downstream on the <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s magnificent Cheesman Canyon,'' <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> DeHihns </PERSON> said he was recommending continuation of a veto process started March 24 by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. The next step is two months of hearings. The final decision will be made at <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> DeHihns </PERSON> said vetoes are rarely overturned, and that about 7,000 pieces of mail his office received about Two Forks ran about 10-1 against the project. In response to criticism by the mayor and water board, <PERSON> DeHihns </PERSON> said, `` I'm not happy they're upset. But I'm obliged to carry out my responsibilities under the law.'' <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area water providers, contending new water resources are needed for a growing metropolitan area, already have spent $ 40 million in research and planning for Two Forks. <PERSON> DeHihns </PERSON> said metropolitan <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> appears to have adequate water supplies for now. He suggested <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> could put more water conservation measures in place before. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said DeHihns could have let project proceed or attach additional environmental requirements. His report said Two Forks dam and reservoir `` was the most environmentally damaging of the alternatives examined.'' Besides flooding a prized trout stream, Two Forks would eliminate about 300 acres of wetlands, and it would alter the river channel with possible effects on threatened and endangered species downstream, including in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, where officials have been strongly opposed to the project. `` I caution that there are still powerful forces aligned against us,'' Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., said in a statement Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., called the decision a major setback `` This decision was made by unelected officials applying subjective standards to a project Coloradans have studied, decided upon, and funded,'' he said.

Mrs. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said she would support <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> City Councilman <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> if he decides to run for the seat. `` It is clear to me that <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> would have wanted to be succeeded by City Councilman <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>,'' she said. `` He loved <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON>, he trusted <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON>, and considered him to be among his closest friends.'' Previously, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said he would not make a decision until Mrs. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> announced her intentions. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> did not immediately return telephone calls to his office Tuesday. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and 15 others were killed Aug. 7 in a plane crash in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> while on a hunger relief mission to a refugee camp. State Sen. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and state Rep. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> have announced they will run for the seat, and several others are believed to be considering entering the race.

<HEAD>Alabama Bans Hazardous Wastes of 22 States, D.C.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> is banning hazardous waste shipments from 22 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to keep the state `` from becoming the waste dump of the nation,'' Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. A representative of the hazardous waste industry said his group plans to challenge the ban _ the second of its type in the country _ in court. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> identified states that would be affected by a law enacted in May. It bars states from sending hazardous waste to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> if they do n't have some means of disposal within their own borders or if they do n't have a cooperative agreement with <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> `` The intent of this legislation was to force states to accept responsibility for the hazardous waste they generate. In the past, it has seemed <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> was the path of least responsibility,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, chief of the department's land division. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s ban is similar to one enacted earlier this year by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> <PERSON> Eskew </PERSON>, an aide to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, applauded the move and said the two states are aiming for `` a regional approach which ensures reciprocity and fair burden sharing'' in waste disposal. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hazardous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the lobbying group has made overturning the two states' laws a top priority. He said the state laws violate federal interstate commerce statutes and will cause a shortage of hazardous waste sites nationally. `` It is virtually certain we will challenge one. The only question is whether we will challenge both,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s ban would affect only the hazardous waste landfill at <LOCATION> Emelle </LOCATION>, the nation's largest. The law leaves it up to the landfill operator, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, to stop shipments from the banned states, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimshawe </PERSON> said the company is studying the list of states and will decide later whether to take legal action. According to figures compiled by state environmental officials, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> ranks fourth in the amount of hazardous waste it collects from other states, and second in net intake, which deducts waste shipped out of the state. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> ranks first in both categories. Mrs. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> predicted the ban could reduce <LOCATION> Emelle </LOCATION>'s waste by 50,000 to 100,000 tons for the rest of the year. Without the ban, the department had predicted that the landfill would receive 700,000 tons of waste this year, up from 550,000 tons last year. Officials from <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and seven other Southeastern states will meet Thursday in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to discuss ways to dispose of hazardous wastes over the next 20 years. Mrs. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said the ban `` could be used as a negotiating tool'' to get the other states to handle their share of waste. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> is the only other Southeast state with a hazardous waste landfill. Eighteen of the banned states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have no disposal facilities. They are <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were banned because they did not respond to the state's request for information about hazardous waste disposal within their borders.

 Justice Minister <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON>, who drug traffickers want dead, summed up the dangers of her job after taking office six weeks ago: `` If they want to kill you, they will _ with or without escort.'' At the time it was merely a realistic statement by a woman who at 32 holds one of the most dangerous government posts in the world. Then she became a target in an anonymous phone call from a man who said: `` You will be the next.'' Since 1984, her ministry has been a post few covet. In that year, drug traffickers murdered Justice Minister <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>. Then, a former justice minister, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Parejo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, was wounded in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, where the government had sent him as ambassador because traffickers had threatened his life. Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> was threatened Thursday, according to press reports, and hours later she boarded a plane for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ three days before her original schedule _ amid rumors she had resigned. The reasons for her rush to confer with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials may help Mrs. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> meet one of her goals as a minister: to obtain money to pay for protection for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> judges threatened by drug barons. The traffickers have vowed to kill 10 judges for every drug lord extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. As justice minister, Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> is a member of a committee deciding on extraditions. `` People should not be afraid of carrying out their duties,'' she said in a Colombian radio interview three weeks ago. She told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> earlier this week that she did not intend to quit and that she was asking the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for $ 19 million to build a security system to protect judges and high officials in her ministry. The administration approved $ 65 million in emergency aid earlier this month for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s war on drugs. Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> has made it clear that being a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister is the high point for her career as a lawyer. `` I got this job because I have experience,'' she said recently. She graduated in 1980 from the exclusive <ORGANIZATION> Bogota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rosary </ORGANIZATION>, a Roman Catholic institution. After working for a few months with her father, also a lawyer, she worked for other private firms developing administrative experience. Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> entered government service in 1986, when <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> became president. Her career began at the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. She later was appointed general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. She became justice minister on July 16 and took an immediate dislike to the tight security surrounding her and her husband, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Paley </PERSON>, an Argentine public relations consultant, and their 3-year-old son. `` With all those armed guys protecting you, one must avoid going out. But that is part of the price being in the post,'' she said. `` I love my family, but I have less and less time with them,'' she added. `` I hope this situation will improve soon.'' It did not and when death squads killed leading presidential hopeful <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> Aug. 18, Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> became involved in an all-out government offensive against drug traffickers. As the government conducted raids across the nation, arresting suspected drug dealers and confiscating millions of dollars in property, said: `` I am not prepared for times of war like these.'' The statement was considered untimely, and rumors that she planned to resign became common in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. She said Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` The threats are out there, but I am satisfied with my protection right now. I am determined that the integrity of our justice system survives this crisis and I hope to play my full part in assuring this.''

 Four people were arrested this morning as racial tension and vandalism continued on the streets where a black man was shot and killed by police. Officers in riot gear doubled their patrols and disbanded small groups of youths to try to prevent a recurrence of the violence and looting that broke out late Monday and early Tuesday. The mother of <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 26, who was shot Sunday, called for calm as community leaders discussed longer-term solutions to defuse the tension in this city of about 54,000. Three of the four arrested were jailed on charges of malicious mischief in the overturning of a parked car, and the fourth on a charge of failure to disperse. There were no arrests in another incident this morning, when about a dozen helmeted officers chased about 10 people after the group yelled obscenities at them. The group later threw bottles and rocks at the officers, but there were no injuries. `` I do n't think it's over,'' said 34-year-old <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Childers </PERSON>, who has lived in <LOCATION> Vineland </LOCATION> for about three years. `` It's just going to escalate.'' After reports of the shooting, nearly 200 people gathered on the city's main street and threw rocks and bottles through store windows. There was looting and about 20 cars were damaged, including police cars that had windshields smashed. Four people were reported injured and 26 people were arrested. On Tuesday night, about 200 people met at a church with religious and community leaders and heard the victim's mother plead for an end to the violence. `` That's not going to bring my son back,'' said <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, sobbing as other family members cried by her side. `` I do n't want nobody else killed. One is enough. `` Let's pull together and love each other,'' she said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was shot Sunday after he apparently threatened officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON> with a steel rod, police Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who was wanted on drug and weapon charges, was spotted by officers after police received an anonymous call about a man on a bicycle carrying drugs, <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON> said. After being told he was under arrest, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> picked up the rod and approached <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON>, swinging, <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON>, who is white, fired two shots, hitting <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> both times. The state Attorney General's office has taken over the investigation of the shooting. <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON> has been taken off street duty and placed on special assignment, city officials said. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, president of the local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People, met with Mayor <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> on Tuesday. Earlier, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> called for <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON>'s resignation, saying the police chief mishandled the matter by calling the shooting a `` justifiable homicide'' before a complete investigation `` That was the catalyst,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` That sparked the anger.''

At the same time last year, 216 people had been killed, and the total of 372 homicides in 1988 set a city record. Police said at least one of Tuesday's slayings was drug-related. About 60 percent of the city's killings are related to drugs, according to police, who add that drug-related violence has also increased the murder rate in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s suburbs.

<TEXT>
 So few students were killed during last year's pro-democracy uprising in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> that they were n't `` worth mentioning,'' the country's health and education minister said. Dr. <PERSON> Pe </PERSON> <PERSON> Thein </PERSON>, addressing a <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> meeting Tuesday of scholars just back from education overseas, said `` students must see the truth behind last year's incidents.'' A transcript of his remarks, reported in an official Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> broadcast, was seen today in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. Diplomats, dissidents and international human rights groups estimate several thousand people were killed last year in a series of army clampdowns on student-led unrest from March to September. According to witness accounts and independent reports, scores of students were among those killed as troops fired indiscriminately into crowds of peaceful demonstrators. `` I do n't mean to say that there were no casualties, only that there were few casualties, of which students constitute so small a number as to be not worth mentioning,'' <PERSON> Pe </PERSON> <PERSON> Thein </PERSON> said. The military government admitted killing hundreds as it crushed dissent in September, but it said most were `` looters'' or `` destructive ... unscrupulous elements.'' Last June, all schools and universities throughout the country were closed because of the unrest. Though primary and middle schools recently re-opened, university and high schools remain closed. The minister said the country needed technocrats and intellectuals to reconstruct the nation, but `` school teachers -LRB- must -RRB- guide their students to becoming clever people and ... -LRB- to -RRB- avoid taking part in destructive acts.'' <PERSON> Pe </PERSON> <PERSON> Thein </PERSON> told the scholars that attempts were being made to try to divide the army and the people in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. He accused foreign broadcasting stations of using `` human rights issues to portray themselves as the only ones who love the country and report that the defense forces do not love the nation.'' `` The defense forces have been portrayed by some as a barbaric force,'' he said. He warned teachers, as public servants, to stay clear of party politics. `` Despite repeated warnings, we have had to part ways with some -LRB- teachers -RRB- because of their contacts with political parties,'' he said. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> have reported authorities arrested at least 2,000 people since putting the two leaders of the main opposition group under house arrest on July 20. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> and Tin Oo, who head the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, were accused of trying to divide the people and the military after criticizing the government's human rights record. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> says it has received `` credible'' reports that many pro-democracy activists have been tortured, sometimes fatally, after being arrested.

<HEAD>Probe of L.A. Mayor Reportedly Uncovers No Criminal Impropriety</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 City investigators who have spent nearly five months scrutinizing the personal finances of Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> have uncovered no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, it was reported today. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> could be fined for alleged improper financial disclosures, but the man recently re-elected to an unprecedented fifth term is unlikely to face any criminal charges, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> reported. A final report from City Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> is expected sometime in September. `` The process still is going on. Anything can happen in two weeks,'' the Times quoted an unnamed source as saying. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> has said he would not comment on the investigation until the report is released. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s inquiry focuses on the 71-year-old mayor's connection to <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which paid <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> $ 18,000 as a consultant. After some inquiries by <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, City Treasurer <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> subsequently had $ 2 million in city funds deposited with the bank. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said he did not pressure <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> says he has not been pressured. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> later returned the $ 18,000 fee.

 A day after he was sentenced to a year in prison for perjury, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said he decided not to testify at his trial to avoid revealing that he and his siblings were abused by their father. The former congressman said Tuesday he decided to disclose the family secret after discussions with his brothers, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, and his sister, <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> joined him at his home in suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for the news conference. `` My father's a very sick man,'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, denied the allegations of abuse. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, a Republican who represented <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s 4th District in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for two terms until his defeat in 1988, was sentenced Monday to a year in prison for his conviction on nine counts of perjury. He also was fined $ 30,000 plus $ 450 in court costs. The former congressman said immediately after his trial that he did not take the stand because a deposition taken in connection with a dispute with his father `` contained information about something my father did to a family member.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said Tuesday he felt certain that prosecutors would have asked him on the witness stand about the alleged incidents, which he described a day earlier as `` so disgusting I will not even publicly disclose it.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said Tuesday night he did not believe the prosecution would have raised the allegations during the June trial. `` As far as I can tell this has nothing to do with his case; he's having a severe case of Monday morning quarterbacking,'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s sister said her father had sexually abused her as a young teen-ager, but that her siblings had agreed not to discuss the matter publicly until now. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> denied abusing his daughter. `` When anybody accuses me of incest he better be proving it. I deny that completely,'' he said. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, 38, remains free on his own recognizance pending an appeal. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was convicted June 20 lying to a federal grand jury in 1988 about his negotiations for an $ 850,000 loan from a federal agent posing as a drug money launderer.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 2nd graf to indicate these are the first suspensions
of any professional athlete for steriod use. A longer version moved on

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> suspended 13 players who tested positive for steroids, indicating that warnings of a crackdown on the muscle-building drugs months ago may have worked. The action marked the first time <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> professional athletes had been suspended for steriod use. No other league conducts mandatory tests for the drugs. The small number of suspensions under the new steroid policy seemed to please even the <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Players </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which has challenged the accuracy of tests and the suspensions. `` The fact that so few players have been suspended for alleged steroid use indicates that the public perception of the steroid problem in the <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> is greatly exaggerated,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON>, executive director of the union and former All-Pro guard. Of the 13 players suspended for four weeks, only Pro Bowl guard <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Solt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION> was of any prominence. Meanwhile, two other prominent players were suspended for using illegal drugs. All-Pro cornerback <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Rams and tight end <PERSON> Orson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mobley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> will miss the final exhibition game and the first three regular-season games. Commissioner <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozelle </PERSON> announced the steroid policy on March 21, saying he wanted to allow time for players who might be using steroids to get them out of their system before the start of training camp. A letter detailing the plan was sent 10 days later to all players. In both 1987 and 1988, 6 percent of the players had positive steroid tests, but no suspensions were imposed. The percentages were much lower this time. The <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> tested more than 2,200 players for both illegal drugs and steroids. An unspecified number of players tested positive but already have been cut from their teams, the league said. The warnings seem to have worked, even by the testimony of one of those caught, linebacker <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Mraz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raiders </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was very disappointed and very emotional,'' coach <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanahan </PERSON> said. `` He said he was aware of the new policy since April 1. He informed me that he had not been on them since then.'' But Coach <PERSON> Lindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Infante </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, who lost offensive linemen <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Uecker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ariey </PERSON>, said the warnings may not have been enough. `` After all that was mentioned about it and all the letters that had gone out and all the notoriety about the decision to test for it and punish the people caught for it, I'm quite shocked that anybody would run the risk of this happening,'' <PERSON> Infante </PERSON> said. The 13 players also included three <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bills </ORGANIZATION> _ brothers <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Doctor </PERSON>, a linebacker, and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Doctor </PERSON>, a fullback, and linebacker <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaworksi </PERSON>. Others were defensive back <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Bears, running back <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Amoia </PERSON> and wide receiver <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jets </ORGANIZATION>, tight end <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Rams, and running back <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> and nose tackle <PERSON> Rollin </PERSON> <PERSON> Putzier </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Coach <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Jets </ORGANIZATION> said he would release <LOCATION> Amoia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>. But General Manager <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION> said he would welcome back <PERSON> Solt </PERSON>. And Buffalo general manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Polian </PERSON> said all three of his suspended players will make the team. `` They are not druggies,'' <PERSON> Polian </PERSON> said. `` They're good kids who made a mistake and are paying the penalty for it.'' <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> said some players had called the union claiming they were innocent. He suggested that tests may have mistaken other medication as steroids or `` masking agents'' designed to hide the their presence.

<HEAD>Actor Sues Surgeon Over Face Lift; Says Career Ruined</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 You might not know actor <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> by name, but he bets you knew his dimples until a plastic surgeon smoothed one away and, so he says, killed his livelihood. In a lawsuit made known Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> said his earnings as an actor in commercials dropped more than two-thirds after a 1983 facelift erased his left dimple. `` The secret of his success was his dimples, his Irish-American dimply smile,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>'s lawyer. In court papers <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, 59, said: `` I have a specific look which is all-American, perky ... a genuine trustable person who sells.'' The Daily News reported <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> sued for $ 5 million; the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said $ 10 million. <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> said that before consenting to surgery, he told Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> how important his dimples were to his appearances in ads for Irish Spring soap, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>'s Big Boy restaurants, <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> shirts, the Belmont Racetrack and <PERSON> Dellwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Milk </PERSON>, among others. He said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> assured him the operation would leave his dimples intact. However, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> was told before the operation that there was no guarantee how the tightening of his jowls would affect his dimples. According to the suit, <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> won one job for about every six auditions he made before he was operated on Oct. 20, 1983. After the operation, he said he won only one job for every 50 auditions. In 1982 <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> said he made as much as $ 56,000; two years later his earnings plunged to $ 16,731. <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> sued in 1984, but the case came to light Tuesday when Justice <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sklar </PERSON> ruled the actor could add breach of contract to his suit.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Roman Catholic journalist, in a rare criticism of the church, said Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>'s remarks about Jews may be `` deeply wounding'' to people who lost loved ones in the Nazi holocaust. Criticism of <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>'s comments on Jewish-Catholic relations spread worldwide on Tuesday, although some <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> clerics said the Polish primate's remarks may have been misconstrued. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> told pilgrims at <ORGANIZATION> Jasna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monastery </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Czestochowa </LOCATION> on Saturday that Polish anti-Semitism would disappear if Jews abandon `` anti-Polonism,'' or anti-Polish sentiments. He asked Jews to understand that it offended Poles' religious sensibilities and feelings of sovereignty to insist on removal of a Carmelite convent set up on the edge of the former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>. `` Dear Jews, do not talk to us from the position of a nation elevated over all others and do not put to us conditions that are impossible to meet,'' <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> said. But he intensified charges of anti-Semitism by using language that invoked the image of Jews spreading communism and by saying that <PERSON> Jews </PERSON> collaborated with <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> during World War II, that Jews as businessmen neglected or detested Poles and that Jews have easy access to mass media. Polish <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> journalist <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwinski </PERSON> said: `` The expressions used by the primate, even contrary to his intentions, pose a danger of deeply wounding the feelings of many of those who are descendants and brothers of the Holocaust victims.'' The rare published criticism appeared Monday in the Polish opposition's <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. Cardinal <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeCourtray </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, said Tuesday it was unlikely that <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>'s words were meant the way they were received. He said the `` primate and bishops of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> can not be accused of an anti-Semitism, which they denounce.'' Referring to <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>'s comment about easy Jewish access to mass media, the International League against <ORGANIZATION> Racism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Semitism </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that he had `` made use of arguments used against Jews by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> yesterday and by the extreme right in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> today.'' <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON>, a legislator from the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said Tuesday in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, `` Anti-Semitism has a long history in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and I think it is ridiculous to talk about ` anti-Polonism.''' <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s chief rabbi, <PERSON> Elio </PERSON> <PERSON> Toaff </PERSON>, said in a newspaper interview that the question of anti-Semitism is something the church `` has to face. ... The analysis has to be deep enough to eradicate once and for all the anti-Semitism that still exists in many countries, like <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' `` It is particularly serious that it was <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, one noted for diplomacy and political gifts, who confused cause and effects,'' said <PERSON> Tullia </PERSON> <PERSON> Zevi </PERSON>, head of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, quoted in the same article Monday in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s I Messaggero. The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> issued a statement Monday calling <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>'s comments `` malicious and out of place.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, the archbishop of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Tuesday he was `` shocked'' by <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>'s `` harmful'' remarks. In a news conference, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> also called on Polish church officials to honor their commitment to move the Carmelite convent at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>. The convent site has been criticized as offensive because an estimated 2.5 million of the 4 million victims of <LOCATION> Auschwitz-Birkenau </LOCATION> were executed simply for being Jewish. Only several thousand Jews live in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> today compared with a pre-war Jewish population of 3.5 million. Relations between the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and Jewish groups have been strained since Aug. 10 when Cardinal <PERSON> Franciszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, whose diocese includes the camp, announced the church was suspending a 1987 agreement to move the convent. He said it could not fulfill the agreement in an atmosphere of `` aggressive demands.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>'s comments could be construed to shift `` the blame to the Jews for demanding that a signed accord be carried out.'' `` I do n't think that is just, and I do n't think that is charitable. And it certainly does n't represent my position,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. The proposal to remove the convent, founded in 1984 just outside the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> fence, has found little sympathy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Poles have argued that thousands of the victims at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> were Polish political prisoners, including many priests and nuns. Most Poles acknowledge that anti-Semitism still exists in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. But some say its depth is exaggerated and note that many Poles risked their lives to protect Jews during the war.

<TEXT>
 In the world of mathematics, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Chudnovsky </PERSON> are known for going the extra mile. Unsatisfied with their record 600-mile-long calculation of pi in June, the brothers more than doubled that record, coming up with a number containing more than a billion digits. `` They're starting more calculations, so it goes on from here,'' <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arvay </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. `` I do n't know when they're going to stop.'' Meanwhile, six <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> scientists extended man's search into the infinite by determining the world's largest known prime number. The find left <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, one of the researchers, groping for a way to describe the 65,087-digit number. `` It's God-awful large,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` There's nothing in the real universe that is comparable at all, that you measure in those numbers.'' Pi, the ratio between the diameter and circumference of a circle, begins 3.14159, then continues on indefinitely with no known duplication or pattern. Since pi was first approximated at 3 1 @ 7 in ancient <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, it took centuries and the invention of the computer in recent decades for scientists to calculate the ratio to more than 100,000 decimal places. But in less than three months, the <ORGANIZATION> Chudnovskys </ORGANIZATION> extended their record calculation from 480 million decimal places to more than a billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researchers did their work on two supercomputers at <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yorktown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, the company said. The new mark of 1,011,196,691 digits appears to be a record, <PERSON> Arvay </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Renz </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Mathematical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said he had not heard of anybody exceeding the researchers' mark In June, the <ORGANIZATION> Chudnovskys </ORGANIZATION> said their 480 million-digit pi would stretch for 600 miles if printed. At the time, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Chudnovsky </PERSON> said calculating pi to such lengths is useful for testing the performance of computer hardware and software. He called the task `` the ultimate stress test.'' In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the six researchers at computer maker <ORGANIZATION> Amdahl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spent evenings and weekends during the last year using the company's machines to find the largest prime number The number equals 391,581 multiplied by 2 to the 216,193 rd power, minus one To put that in perspective, that's 600 times the number of atoms in the known universe, according to <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarantonello </PERSON>, one of the researchers. `` It's like going to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>, in a sense. There's not a lot there, but it's important scientifically to do it because the technology proves so useful,'' researcher <PERSON> Bodo </PERSON> <PERSON> Parady </PERSON> said. A prime number is any number that can be divided evenly only by 1 and itself. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the previous record was set in 1985 by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Slowinski </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the supercomputer maker. The new number, discovered Aug. 6, has 37 more digits and is a trillion, trillion, trillion times larger. <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, Calif.-based <ORGANIZATION> Amdahl </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> had accepted the number for entry into the publication. The discovery was announced at a meeting this week of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mathematical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagstaff </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a computer scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Although the number itself has no known practical application, the advanced multiplication programs honed by the researchers during their work already are being used by scientists searching the universe for pulsars, rotating neutron stars. The process also has applications in cryptology and bank transaction coding, which use large prime numbers. The other <ORGANIZATION> Amdahl </ORGANIZATION> researchers were: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Noll </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>.

 An Afghan rebel leader who has been a major recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid will boycott meetings of the guerrillas' interim government until elections are held, his spokesman said today. It was the latest blow to the Moslem insurgents' government-in-exile, which has been troubled by bickering and fighting The leader, <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> of the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> rebel group, said he will no longer attend the government's cabinet meetings until elections are held, his spokesman, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Qadeer </PERSON> <PERSON> Karyab </PERSON>, said in an interview. The move fulfilled a threat <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> made earlier this month when he criticized the interim government for not meeting a six-month deadline for elections and the drafting of an Islamic constitution for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The charismatic rebel leader has repeatedly been accused of treachery by rival guerrilla fighters. His group was accused of carrying out last month's massacre of 32 rebels of Jamiat-i-Islami, an equally powerful but more liberal guerrilla group. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the major supporter of the rebels, condemned the killings in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s northern <LOCATION> Takhar </LOCATION> province. Since then, the fighting between the two rebel groups has escalated, and the latest reports claim hundreds may have died in recent clashes. Jamiat leader <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> called for <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>'s suspension from the government following the <LOCATION> Takhar </LOCATION> slayings <PERSON> Sibghatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON>, president of the rebels' interim government, branded <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> a `` killer'' and claimed he has used <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military backing to kill other guerrillas and Afghans. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>'s group has been a major recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid channeled through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> policy gives full support to the fragile government-in-exile. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> special envoy to the guerrillas, was meeting Afghan rebels based in the southwestern <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Quetta </LOCATION> today and could not be immediately reached for comment. <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON> is on his second tour of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where the majority of the anti-Communist rebels are headquartered. Aside from accommodating the fractious guerrilla government, whose membership is limited to seven major rebel parties, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> shelters 3 million Afghan war refugees. For more than a decade the insurgents have been fighting to topple the Marxist government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. The guerrrillas also receive military aid from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and other Arab states. In 1979, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> sent in troops to back its communist allies against a growing insurgency and to replace one leader with another. But in February the last of more than 100,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Elections were promised by the rebel leadership within six months of its government's establishment in February. <PERSON> Syed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON>, the leader of the moderate <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, holds the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> portfolio, which puts him in charge of elections. But a spokesman for his group, <PERSON> Azim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser-Zia </PERSON>, said the government does not have the money to hold the elections. `` Somehow nothing has been allocated for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to have its own office, let alone conduct an election,'' the spokesman said. `` It ca n't be done by just one man.''

 Syrian and Christian forces battled for six hours with artillery in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today, and mortar rounds exploded near a meeting between a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> peace envoy and a Moslem leader. Police said one person was killed and 19 wounded in the fighting. The latest casualties raised the toll from the nearly six months of clashes to at least 803 killed and 2,287 wounded. The French envoy, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON>, drove from the Christian sector across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line into Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> during mortar and sniper exchanges. He met with <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamseddine </PERSON>, the senior Shiite Moslem cleric in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON> traveled with an escort of two carloads of bodyguards. During a 45-minute meeting at <PERSON> Shamseddine </PERSON>'s second-floor apartment in the <LOCATION> Tallet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Khayat </LOCATION> district, five mortar rounds exploded nearby. <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shamseddine </PERSON> moved from his living room to an interior hallway for safety while they finished their discussions, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer at the meeting. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said two Frenchmen with an engineering team, <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Guigard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Paron </PERSON>, were wounded by mortar shrapnel in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today. Telephone lines were out, and French Embassy officials could not be reached. Today's fighting flared early this morning after Syrian gunners bombarded the 28-mile coastline of the besieged Christian enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` Their radar must have detected some ship movements off the Christian enclave,'' said a spokesman on condition of anonymity. No ships were reported hit today. A Maltese-flagged tanker, the Sunshield, was hit and set on fire by <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> shells Tuesday as it tried to run the Syrian blockade. Seven crewmen were killed and two were wounded. Police said two were missing and believed dead. Before meeting <PERSON> Shamseddine </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON> met with Patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>, spiritual leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> sect, for 90 minutes at his seat in the mountain-peak resort of <LOCATION> Bkirki </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. No details of the talks were reported. In addition, the envoy declined comment on other talks he held Tuesday with Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the Christian leader, and acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem. <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON>, secretary-general of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Tuesday after two days of talks with Syrian leaders in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. The French peace plan calls for lifting blockades by both sides, a halt to arms deliveries to the warring factions, political reforms to distribute power equally between Christians and Moslems, and the withdrawal of Syrian and Israeli forces from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Another peace envoy, Soviet <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Tasarov </PERSON>, left <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> today after talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> leaders. He has been trying to revive a stalled Arab League peace effort. After the fighting broke out in March, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive the Syrians out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The troops came under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate, but <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> says they are really backing the Moslems in the nation's 14-year-old civil war.

<HEAD>Moldavians Considering Language Compromise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, in an effort to placate outraged minority groups, proposed today that the republic adopt a weaker version of a law making Moldavian the official language, an activist said. The compromise, which reportedly resulted from a telephone conversation between the party chief and President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, is aimed at stopping widespread strikes and other protests in the republic. The initial proposed law would substitute Moldavian for Russian in virtually all government and business transactions in the republic. Russians and other minorities in the republic say the proposal is discriminatory. The proposed compromise, outlined to the Supreme Soviet by <LOCATION> Moldavian </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Semen </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossu </PERSON>, would make Moldavian the language for government officials and documents, and Russian the tongue for everyday contact among the republic's ethnic groups. The compromise was reported by <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Nestase </PERSON>, a leader of the pro-Moldavian People's Front who spoke by telephone from the republic's capital, <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, now has no law specifying which language is to be used, but Russian has traditionally been the tongue for government affairs. <PERSON> Grossu </PERSON> proposed the compromise after reporting he had spoken with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> by telephone Tuesday night about the language controversy. The Moldavian party chief did not say whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had suggested the compromise, but <PERSON> Nestase </PERSON> said it was widely believed this was the case. `` We think this is the most realistic compromise,'' <PERSON> Nataly </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascal </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> member, said in a telephone interview. `` We support this compromise and we're not the only ones.'' The Moldavian Supreme Soviet began debating the proposal on Tuesday, and <PERSON> Nestase </PERSON> said the session would continue Thursday. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has quietly been involved in several attempts recently to quell nationalist unrest breaking out in may of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s republics. He told the Lithuanian party chief during the weekend that the independence movement there had gone too far. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also `` worked out'' with other members of the ruling Politburo a tough party statement Saturday condemning nationalism, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told a news briefing Tuesday. The statement by the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> warned that independence movements were leading the country into an `` abyss.'' A strike organizer in the Moldavian city of <LOCATION> Tiraspol </LOCATION>, where Russians and other minorities walked off their jobs last week to protest the proposed language law, said strikers were willing to consider the compromise even though they would still prefer that Russian and Moldavian be given equal status. The weekly <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News today highlighted unemployment as a factor in the republic's unrest. It said at least 150,000 of the republic's 4.2 million people are unemployed, and the number is growing Pravda repeated earlier criticism of <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> activists, accusing them of `` spreading the seeds of separatism and nationalism'' and claiming that Moldavian parliamentarians ordered Pravda correspondent to leave the republic. The Supreme Soviet session addressing the law opened Tuesday, and several thousand people, some carrying red-yellow-and-blue Moldavian banners, gathered after the debate in downtown <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION> to show support for the People's Front. `` We have to seize the moment,'' said <PERSON> Ala </PERSON> <PERSON> Myndycanu </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> governing council. `` We have to solve our problems before <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> does.'' But non-Moldavian activists, members of the Russian-language group <PERSON> Yedinstvo </PERSON>, warned that `` life wo n't be quiet'' if the original law was passed over the objections of strikers. Disgruntled Russian-speaking residents of the republic are striking at almost 200 factories and offices to protest the bill, said <PERSON> Vsevolod </PERSON> <PERSON> Yampolsky </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Tiraspol </LOCATION> strike committee. Most of the strikes are in cities with large <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> populations. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported today that railroad workers in several <LOCATION> Moldavian </LOCATION> cities had joined the strike. The portion of the bill that would be cut out under the compromise would have made Moldavian the language among Russians, Ukrainians, Jews, Bulgarians, and other nationalities in the republic. That goes farther than the language laws in a number of other republics. Many non-Moldavians do not speak Moldavian, but they share some knowledge of Russian as a result of Soviet schooling. The law also would restore the Latin alphabet, replacing the Cyrillic imposed by dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> after he annexed <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in 1940. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> imposed the Cyrillic, used in Russian, to back up his claim that Romanians and Moldavians are two distinct nationalities. Ethnic Moldavians make up 64 percent of the republic's 4.2 million people.

<HEAD>Solidarity Lawmaker: Break Communist Monopoly on Foreign Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Solidarity lawmaker criticized the Communists' foreign policy record today and suggested a non-Communist official should be named foreign minister in Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s new government. <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, head of the Solidarity parliamentary delegation, also said in the pro-Solidarity <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> newspaper today that the Communists should assume at least one economic ministry so the party would have a sense of `` co-responsibility'' for economic policy. Communist leaders have been pressing to keep the ministry of foreign affairs in the hands of current Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Olechowski </PERSON>, a party member. The post is one of several areas of conflict as <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a longtime Solidarity activist, forms the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first government led by non-Communists. <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> has said that the new government would be announced before Sept. 10. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> assumed office on Aug. 24. `` Experiences in Polish foreign policy ... indicate that the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- does not serve'' national interests, <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said in the interview published today. He cited a recent agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> ally <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over disputed waters in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> near the port of <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, which many Poles believe was settled to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s disadvantage. <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> noted that the information department of the foreign ministry legally `` functions as a service unit for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'' of the party. This `` does not correspond to the requirements of the new period,'' he said. Although <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> did not say specifically that the ministry should be taken away from the party, his remarks about breaking the party's monopoly on foreign policy appeared to indicate that the ministry should go either to Solidarity or one of two minor allied parties, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peasants </LOCATION> and the Democrats. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who is acting as the party's envoy in the coalition talks with <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, argued strongly Tuesday for the party to retain control of the ministry. `` We think that the best candidate is <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Olechowski </PERSON>,'' he said in an interview with the party paper <PERSON> Trybuna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludu </PERSON>. `` If professionalism is a criterion, then undoubtedly <PERSON> Olechowski </PERSON> is an expert of the highest class.'' He also cited <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s alliances in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc that he said have protected national security. `` No matter what you accuse the party of, its foreign policy is not subject to criticism,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` It has guaranteed us a safe, stable place in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s favorable position in the world and alliances which allow us a feeling of national security. `` Society needs this feeling and it has to be maintained.'' <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said he favored only limited participation by the Communists in the <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> government. `` Broad participation.. would not be understandable to public opinion,'' he said. Solidarity already has promised the Communists control of the important defense and interior ministries, which control the army and police. <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> reiterated in today's article that the party ought to take one of the five economic ministries: finance, agriculture, foreign trade, labor or industry. That way it `` could not be in opposition to the government's economic policy and spread social demagogy,'' he said. He suggested that non-Communist adminstrators serve just below the defense and interior ministers. Another controversial area is control of the mass media. <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said the committee that oversees state radio and television should be put under control of parliament, where Solidarity and its allies hold a majority. Personnel decisions in radio and television will be one of the quickest signs of change under the new government, <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration appears to be largely `` on automatic pilot'' because of the president's failure to fill many top executive branch positions, Democratic congressional researchers say. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not nominated anyone by Aug. 9 to fill 160 of the top 394 positions requiring <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` It is believed that this number of vacancies so late in a president's first year in office is without precedent,'' the report said. Among them, although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he wants to be remembered as an `` education president,'' are five of the seven assistant secretaries of education, it said. Four assistant administrator slots are vacant at the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the president has not nominated anyone as chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, the report said. Openings were also listed for three undersecretaries and 13 assistant secretaries in other departments. `` It appears as though a significant portion of the government is on automatic pilot,'' said the DSG, an organization of House Democrats that provides research papers to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The DSG said it did not have comparable figures for past administrations, although its analysis in May showed that four previous presidents had made appointments during their first six weeks in office at a pace two to four times as fast as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Deputy White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where the president is vacationing, said the administration's count is not the same as the DSG's. `` Their numbers conflict because they wanted to go with the broadest brush to try and add to the sensational nature of their conclusions,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. The White House counts 308 presidential appointments within the Cabinet departments. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said appointees to 129 of these posts have been confirmed, and 38 are awaiting confirmation. He said 25 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointees had been retained and 84 candidates were now being cleared for appointment. He said most of the remaining 37 vacancies had candidates under consideration. `` The notion that somehow <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been crippled by the fact that he has n't got all of his assistant secretaries in place just does n't make any sense,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. The DSG report dealt with a larger figure because it included posts outside of the Cabinet departments. The report said that as of Aug. 10, only 156 of the 394 positions were filled by an appointee confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Nominations for 60 positions were awaiting confirmation, and remain so since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been in recess. Two nominations, of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> to be secretary of defense and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to be assistant attorney general for civil rights, were rejected. Tower was turned down by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> by the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. For 16 positions, appointees of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have been asked to remain on the job. `` It is not clear how the failure to fill so many key positions in a timely manner will affect the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration or the country generally,'' the report said. `` It does, however, appear to set the administration on a course that is virtually 180 degrees at variance with the prevailing view of scholars and former White House officials on how the presidency should be managed.'' Defenders of the administration have argued that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not need to move quickly because he succeeded a president of his own party and thus did not need to make major policy changes. The DSG, however, said the slower pace `` could be as important a liability to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration as it would be to any other.'' Even if the remaining nominations are made and confirmed quickly this fall, those people would have missed most of the planning for next year's budget and legislative initiatives, the report said. All of the Cabinet positions have been filled. However, posts for which no nomination has been made and no <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> holdover is in place include two assistant secretaries of agriculture, an undersecretary of commerce, a deputy undersecretary and six assistant secretaries of defense, an assistant secretary of energy, two assistant secretaries of health and human services, two assistant secretaries of housing and urban development, an assistant secretary of the interior, a deputy attorney general and associate attorney general, an undersecretary and an assistant secretary of state, an undersecretary and an assistant secretary of the treasury and three assistant secretaries of veterans' affairs. The only department at which all the top posts have been filled is Transportation, the report said.

 <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, the heiress who molded the historic <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> into one of the nation's most liberal dailies during her 37 years at its helm, died of cancer today. She was 86. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Faris </PERSON>, a vice president at the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> died at her <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> home. She had been sick since May. The Post, <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> once said, advocated `` honest unionism, social reform and humane government programs.'' Her paper was a middle-class tabloid, packed with columns and features, restrained only by <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>'s legendary tight fist. The Post is the oldest continuously published newspaper in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, first published by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> in 1801, and was one of the few metropolitan newspapers owned by a woman. She was credited with saving the Post when she broke with other publishers during a long newspaper strike in 1963 and resumed publishing under the old contract. The paper gained circulation during that period, and within a few years became the city's only afternoon paper. `` Often voted least likely to succeed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s competitive journalistic climate, she outmaneuvered such moneyed rivals as <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION>'s Journal-American, <ORGANIZATION> Scripps-Howard </ORGANIZATION>'s World Telegram and Sun, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, and in the end outlasted them,'' noted <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>. On Nov. 19, 1976, after years of turning down potential buyers, she sold the Post to media magnate <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, reportedly for $ 31 million. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> transformed the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> into a racier and more politically conservative tabloid before selling it to real estate developer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> last year. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, known to many as <PERSON> Dolly </PERSON>, was born on March 11, 1903, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adele </PERSON> <PERSON> Neustadt </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>. Her grandfather was financier <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, a founder of the <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> banking house and a prominent philanthropist. The heiress studied at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s exclusive <ORGANIZATION> Brearly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and attended <ORGANIZATION> Bryn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mawr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` I was a rich kid of the right kind _ not the robber baron type _ and had been to the right schools,'' she said in a diary entry quoted in a 1976 biography by <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> called `` Men, Money and Magic.'' `` I remember being furious whenever it -LRB- her wealth -RRB- was mentioned. People even said, not entirely joking, ` Come on, give me a million. You wo n't even miss it.''' But <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>'s thrift at the newspaper was legendary. The Post always seemed to do more with less _ the smallest staff, the most decrepit equipment. `` I do n't know if it's fear of being self-indulgent or a puritanical guilt, but spending just is n't easy for me,'' she once said. In the early 1930s, <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> became involved in social welfare efforts _ a settlement house for immigrants, several hospitals, a club that provided lunches to women looking for jobs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She became a confidante of President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON>. At one point, she declined <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s invitation to run a program in his administration for farm women. Her involvement in politics escalated, however. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Backer </PERSON>, her husband, was appointed to the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and then ran unsuccessfully for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for the state <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> in 1938, losing to city Parks Commissioner <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>. In 1939, <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> bought the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> at Backer's request. At first, <PERSON> Backer </PERSON> served as editor and president; she served as director and vice president and her ownership was not public knowledge. Financial losses led <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> to believe that the paper needed comic strips, columns, features and a tabloid format. When Backer disagreed, <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> promoted <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Olin </PERSON> <PERSON> Thackrey </PERSON> from feature editor to executive editor. In 1942, <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> became president and publisher. She divorced Backer in 1943 and married Thackrey. She and <PERSON> Thackrey </PERSON> differed in print in 1948. Thackrey supported <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>; <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> backed Republican <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>. By 1950, <PERSON> Thackrey </PERSON> was out, both as <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> editor and as <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>'s husband. In the 1950s, under <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wechsler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> became known for investigative reporting. The Post eventually found an audience among the city's liberal middle class. After years of profits, the paper's fortunes dimmed in the 1970s as much of its audience moved to the suburbs. Ultimately, <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> sold it to <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>. `` It was a terrible headache,'' she said. <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>'s four marriages ended in divorce. Her first husband was <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B.W </PERSON>. Hall, followed by Backer, Thackrey and <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonneborn </PERSON>. She is survived by her two daughters, Adele Hall Sweet and <PERSON> Sarah-Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramarsky </PERSON>, her son <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, 15 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. <PERSON> Faris </PERSON> said a private burial was planned, with a memorial service later.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishops File Brief in Abortion Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's Roman Catholic bishops are urging the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to use a pair of cases from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> to overturn its 1973 decision legalizing abortion. In a friend-of-the-court brief filed earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> said past high-court rulings on abortion have usurped legislative authority. The brief added: `` For this court, the time has come to decide whether to continue to write rules or to allow legislatures to legislate.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, filed a similar brief earlier this year in a case the court used to give states greater power to regulate abortions. The justices already have agreed to study the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> cases during the term that begins in October. Both cases involve laws that require doctors to notify the parents of young, unmarried girls who seek abortions. The court also will study an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case involving stringent regulation of abortion clinics. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> parental notice laws have been portrayed erroneously as creating conflicts between the rights of parents and children, the Catholic Conference brief asserted. `` If a family is to retain any vitality when confronted by this reality -LRB- of a young girl's pregnancy -RRB-, its members must ... be entitled to reflect upon and discuss whether -LRB- the girl -RRB- should consider termination of her pregnancy through abortion,'' the brief said. It added: `` To rule that a state may not shield the family for a brief time for this kind of consultation is to deny family integrity and ultimately to undermine familial relationships.''

<HEAD>Minorities, Women Accept Out-of-Court Settlement on Discrimination
Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA PERLMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of minority and female police officers that sued the city for discrimination has accepted a settlement after recent <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings against affirmative action programs. `` There are mixed feelings,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Drew </PERSON>, the attorney representing the 10 minority and 11 female officers. `` Considering the latest rulings, we did not feel that the laws of this country, as interpreted by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, are favorable to minority and female litigants.'' According to the settlement, the city will pay the officers $ 325,000, including court costs and attorney fees. It was not disclosed how much each person would receive, <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> recently issued decisions to restrict affirmative action programs and make it more difficult for plaintiffs to prove discrimination in the workplace. In March 1988, the minority officers _ eight blacks, a Hispanic and an American Indian _ sued the city, seeking $ 4.6 million in damages. Two months later, 11 female officers filed a similar suit seeking more than $ 1.6 million. Both suits alleged the officers were denied promotional opportunities because of their race or gender. The two cases were joined for the purpose of settlement talks. The trial was to begin Sept. 12. At the time the suits were filed, only one of the department's 45 command officers _ sergeant and above _ was classified as a minority. At the heart of both suits was a written exam and performance evaluation for the position of sergeant that the officers said were discriminatory and never had been validated to ensure they conformed to civil rights regulations. The city has agreed to hire an independent consultant to develop a professionally validated test for sergeant promotions. <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> said the timing of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings made it impractical for him to take the case to court. He said he believes the settlement `` indicates a willingness on the city's part to put the bad behind us and move forward. Hopefully that will lead to better minority and female representation on the police force.''

 Police battled protesters nationwide today during demonstrations against alleged corruption in Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s government. More than 100,000 people were reported arrested and 10 killed. A daylong general strike shut down commerce and transportation in the six states governed by the opposition, but it was less effective in the 19 states controlled by <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. At least 80 people, including five policemen, were injured and more than 103,450 people were arrested during the strike, police said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported two people were killed during a clash involving police and pro- and anti-government demonstrators in the southern state of <LOCATION> Kerala </LOCATION>, which is governed by a coalition led by the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The news agency said seven people were killed in the northeastern state of <LOCATION> Tripura </LOCATION>, also governed by the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Four of the victims died when strike supporters hurled a bomb at a passenger bus, the new agency said. Two were killed in a clash between police and strike supporters, and one person was stabbed to death, it said. In <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, the country's largest city and the capital of Marxist-ruled <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> state, one opposition supporter was killed and 46 injured as police fired into the air and threw tear gas to try to separate the warring groups, police said. V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, leader of the fractious opposition, said more than 100,000 opposition supporters were arrested in eastern <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state for enforcing the strike. At least 36 people were hurt, eight of them seriously, when baton-carrying police charged stone-throwing mobs, witnesses said. About 2,700 people, including 16 lawmakers, were arrested for sitting on railroad tracks in southern <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> state, police said. Arrests during such protests are routine and detainees are released after a few hours without charges. More than 700 opposition activists were arrested in southern <LOCATION> Andhra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> states, while 50 were taken into custody in northern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, police said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s central shopping arcade, police used batons to break up clashes between pro- and anti-government supporters. Opposition leader <PERSON> Atal </PERSON> <PERSON> Behar </PERSON> <PERSON> Vajpayee </PERSON> and several members of his <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were arrested, police said. The altercation broke out as activists trying to enforce the strike were confronted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> workers, police said. `` As a member of the opposition I wanted the strike to be successful, but I also wanted it to be peaceful and non-violent,'' said <PERSON> Devi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lal </PERSON>, chief minister of northern <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> state and a key opposition leader. The opposition has been trying for nearly two years to focus attention on government corruption. But previous efforts have rapidly lost momentum, largely because squabbling opposition leaders could not agree on a strategy. Last month, in a rare display of unity, 106 opposition members resigned from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, saying a government audit into a controversial arms deal proved kickbacks were paid to senior officials and members of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s party. Opposition leaders contend a Swedish company, <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION>, paid $ 50 million dollars in kickbacks and bribes to secure a $ 1.4 billion contract to supply artillery guns to the Indian army. The government and the company deny wrongdoing. An opinion poll conducted in July by the respected news magazine <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> indicated <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were almost certain to win the election. According to the poll of 10,399 registered voters, the party would return to power capturing 58 percent of the 542 seats in the decision-making lower house of Parliament. Today's strike was called in part to gauge the opposition's clout before parliamentry elections, which must be held by Jan. 4, 1990. Most shops and businesses in the capital closed despite increased police. Government offices operated normally as thousands of employees stayed overnight in their workplaces. The government had said those who failed to work would lose a day's salary. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Delhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> operated its entire fleet of 3,800 passenger buses, <ORGANIZATION> PTI </ORGANIZATION> quoted an official as saying. But witnesses said most buses had few passengers. Press Trust of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> said mobs hurled stones at buses in opposition-controlled areas of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> and at least 14 vehicles were damaged. Several activists of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were arrested following the violence, it said without elaborating The other participants of the strike are the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a group of seven parties. On Tuesday, police arrested at least 5,000 political workers across the country to prevent violence.

 At <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request, the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> will hold a special meeting Thursday to present evidence of the alleged involvement of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in drug trafficking, it was announced today. Thursday is the expiration date of the term of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s provisional president, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solias </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> last year <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s opposition parties are concerned that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will name a puppet government and ignore calls for free elections. The meeting will come just one week after the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> dealt a blow to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hopes of ousting the general by adopting a resolution that stopped short of calling on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down. In requesting the meeting, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it wants to present `` a summary of the evidence and elaboration of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> position on the critical situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> press office said. The decision to call for a meeting of the hemispheric council came in response to a challenge by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s delegate at last week's session for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to present evidence of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged wrongdoings, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, who spoke on condition of They said it was not yet clear whether the evidence will be presented by Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, who represented the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at last week's session, or by another official. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> today urged <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down and `` open the way to a peaceful, democratic resolution of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s problems.'' The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> resolution last week expressed deep concern over the failure of a mediating team dispatched by the organization to promote a democratic transfer of power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The document called on Panamanians to settle their differences by Sept. 1, the date on which the constitution calls for the installation of a new president. Most <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegates viewed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> step down as a dangerous precedent for intervention in the internal affairs of member states. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been pressing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down since February 1988, when he was indicted by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on charges involving drug trafficking. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has claimed the efforts are an attempt to renege on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pledge to hand over the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to his country's control next year. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has served as commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces for six years. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe he will install a puppet successor next month, after voiding results of May 7 elections that observers agree gave a wide majority to the U.S.-backed opposition.

 The nation where World War II began will mark the 50th anniversary of the German invasion beginning Thursday with a series of events nearly overshadowed by the startling political events under way. Joining Communist President Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> at official events will be Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and newly named Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, the first non-Communist to head a Polish government in 45 years. Planned commemorations include an internationally broadcast concert by <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, speeches at <LOCATION> Westerplatte </LOCATION>, where the war's first shots were fired, and an international prayer for peace led by a televised message from Polish-born Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II. The war has an enduring poignancy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which fought against <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> from the conflict's start on Sept. 1, 1939, to the victory in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on May 9, 1945. More than 6 million Poles died, a fifth of the population and a higher percentage than any other nation. The toll included 3 million Jews, deported to death camps such as <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> built in the once-obscure Polish villages by those names. At war's end, 40 percent of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s national property was lost and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> was empty and leveled. In the capital, stucco facades of homes still show the scars of battle. To some, the war's toll continued at the hands of the Communist government that took power backed by Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. `` We will pay homage to all victims of the war, we will pay homage to its heroes and we will express the will to live in peace,'' said <PERSON> Wlodzimierz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozinski </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. The commemoration begins one week after Communist and Solidarity lawmakers joined to elect <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> prime minister. The Solidarity editor heads the first non-Communist government in the Soviet bloc. The events begin tomorrow night with a parade to Victory Square and a changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, who went to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> with his family after the Soviets invaded and later joined the Polish army organized under the Soviets, will lead the ceremony. On Friday, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and others will gather in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> at the 75-foot granite memorial honoring the defenders of <LOCATION> Westerplatte </LOCATION>, where the German battleship <ORGANIZATION> Schleswig-Holstein </ORGANIZATION> fired on a garrison of 182 Polish soldiers to start the war. War veterans from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the Allies will participate, including about 70 survivors of the attack. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> will conduct a concert Friday evening at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s Grand Theater with actress <PERSON> Liv </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullmann </PERSON> and others in a televised benefit for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> will open with lines from W.H. <PERSON> Auden </PERSON>'s poem, `` September 1, 1939,'' and <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pisar </PERSON>, one of the youngest survivors of <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, will narrate reminiscences accompanied by photographs and film of the destruction of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Ullmann </PERSON> will narrate <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenberg </PERSON>'s cantata `` A Survivor From <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>.'' An International Day of Prayer for Peace will bring together representatives of world religions for conferences and contemplation on Thursday and Friday. `` The lessons we draw from World War II must be drawn for the whole world, for international reconciliation and understanding,'' said <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Klaczynski </PERSON>, an organizer. The pope is to address his countrymen Friday evening via a television screen set up in the <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, rebuilt after the being razed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. Jewish groups representing the few thousand Jews who remain from a population that numbered 3.5 million before the war, will mark the anniversary with a photo exhibition, `` Jews in Struggle for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' and a service at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s lone synagogue conducted by the country's only rabbi, <PERSON> Pinchas </PERSON> <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Joskowicz </PERSON>, who arrived this spring from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. There will also be wreaths laid at the monument to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto uprising and at <LOCATION> Umschlagplatz </LOCATION>, where Jews were loaded into railroad boxcars for transport to the death camps. Solidarity, the independent union born in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, has scheduled masses and concerts, including one by bands of miners and shipyard workers. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will send a five-member delegation of parliament members. It had been expected that West German President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> might visit for the anniversary. But the tentative plans were dropped because of lingering diplomatic tensions between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, concerning among other things a stalled West German aid package to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be represented by Secretary of Veterans Affairs <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, the highest ranking Polish-American in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are among the other nations invited to participate.

 Republican <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, who became the first Cuban-American elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, pledged today to unite <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s multi-ethnic community after an emotional race for the late Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>'s seat `` I think it's been a terribly divisive and ethnically divisive campaign,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show after defeating Democrat <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> in Tuesday's special election. `` But now it's time for healing, now we have to reach out to all those sections,'' she said. `` I know there are a lot of people out there who feel alienated. It was a very bitter battle but now we're going to start healing those wounds. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, who did n't rule out seeking the seat again in the scheduled election in 14 months, also promised early today to try to ease the ethnic tensions. `` I and she will unify the community,'' <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> said. During the monthlong campaign, Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> refused to debate <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> following claims that his `` American seat'' theme stirred prejudices against Hispanics. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> had said his remark `` This is an American seat'' was an appeal to voters to decide on qualifications, not birthplace. He also said it was a response to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s statement that the party wanted to elect a Cuban-American `` It was a rough campaign. Wounds from it need to heal,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagt </PERSON>, R-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, 37, a state senator since 1982 and wife of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>, called on <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> and his supporters to meet to discuss the drug and crime problems facing <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` We do not have the luxury to waste time on divisive politics,'' she told more than 1,500 cheering supporters, most from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s conservative Cuban community `` We must focus on what we have in common and not ponder on the negative.'' Pepper, the liberal advocate for the elderly and the only person to hold the seat, died May 30 at age 88. Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>'s campaign included appearances by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Her campaign chairman was the president's son, <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON>. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> called the victory a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> milestone in the South. `` That seat has been a Democratic seat since it was created,'' he said from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` For us to win it is a major victory.'' With all 159 precincts reporting, Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> had 49,638 votes, or 53 percent, to <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>'s 43,759 votes, or 47 percent. Turnout was 50.6 percent, unusually high for a special election. The district covers black neighborhoods such as <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, most of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> and sections of blue-collar <PERSON> Hispanic </PERSON> <PERSON> Hialeah </PERSON> and upscale Coral Gables and Key Biscayne.

If that had happened, we would have won tonight.'' Some of the Cuban exiles at Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>'s victory gathering said that although her election is symbolic of their assimilation into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, they still feel excluded from mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We have brought <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> to office on our own with no support from others,'' said <PERSON> Richardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Samiter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, 55. `` We have been trying to cross the bridge that separates us, but we are treated like second-class citizens. These things we do not forget quickly.'' `` This is a very important step for Cubans. One of us is in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> now,'' said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Esteves </PERSON>, 49. `` She is our blood. She knows our mind. She knows our feelings.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> faces re-election in 14 months, when Pepper's term would have expired

 About 500 people were allowed home after they were evacuated early today because of burning pesticides at a nearby feed store. Several residents reported breathing problems and a few firefighters were overcome by smoke, but there were no serious injuries, said Lt. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Casciato </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ravenna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. A three-block area, which included apartments and group homes for the elderly, was evacuated, he said.

The fire broke out in a section that contained fertilizers and pesticides, <PERSON> Casciato </PERSON> said. The area was destroyed, <PERSON> Casciato </PERSON> said. `` The product itself was being consumed by the fire. We did n't want to put water on it because that would allow it to contaminate the ground,'' he said The fertilizers and pesticides were allowed to burn out, although some water was initially used to cool down the area and keep the fire from spreading to adjoining buildings, he said. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickin </PERSON>, a duty officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, said investigators would be sent into the building when the fire was completely extinguished.

 A judge rejected a crack user's plea for leniency and sentenced her to life imprisonment for letting a man rape her 13-year-old daughter to pay drug debts. Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbier </PERSON> `` sunk to an intolerable level of humanity,'' and showed no potential for rehabilitation. <PERSON> Barbier </PERSON>, 29, who could be paroled in 10 years, was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct for giving her daughter to a man who raped her twice. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, 28, was convicted on the same charge and was sentenced by another judge Thursday to 40 to 60 years in prison. <PERSON> Barbier </PERSON> maintained her innocence. In a letter to <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> dated Aug. 18, she said: `` I feel I have been punished enough,'' in losing her children to her ex-husband, the letter said. `` The last two years of my life has been nothing but tragedy.'' <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> said he imposed more than the 10 to 25 years called for in sentencing guidelines because they `` do n't accurately reflect the nature of this crime.'' `` Your daughter trusted you and you abused that trust beyond all bounds of decency,'' <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> told <PERSON> Barbier </PERSON>. `` This case demonstrates tragically the far-reaching impact of drugs on innocent people,'' the <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> circuit judge said. `` I have not heard of such a situation where drugs were responsible for a mother subjecting her own daughter to sexual abuse.'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Barbier </PERSON> offered her daughter to settle a drug debt, then smoked crack with him after the attack. Assistant Prosecutor <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barbier </PERSON>'s daughter called the May 1988 rape the worst hour of her life. `` The child is grateful her pain is finally over,'' <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said after Tuesday's sentencing. `` She can begin rebuilding herself.'' The victim, now 14, had written a two-page statement before sentencing, but was too shaken to read it in court, said her father, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dare </PERSON>. `` She wanted to ask the judge to keep her mother in prison long enough that she ca n't endanger -LRB- her -RRB- younger children,'' ages 6 and 8, said Dare, 33. `` She spent so much time taking care of those kids that she felt like a mother instead of a sister.'' Dare said he plans to lobby for legislation easing regulations on taking children away from parents who are drug users. <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> granted Dare temporary custody of the victim and her sister, 13. The two other children, who are half-sisters, were staying with a relative. Although <PERSON> Barbier </PERSON> will be eligible for parole in 10 years, <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> must first be notified and then has authority to deny her release, <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Plan Reportedly in Works to Transport East Germans to West</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> is working on a plan to transport at least 1,500 East German refugees from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in the next few days, an Austrian government source said today. The report came amid heightened speculation that officials were formulating a plan to deal with thousands of East Germans who have traveled to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in an effort to flee their Communist homeland for the West. A report in the Munich-based Abendzeitung newspaper today said 15,000 East Germans would be allowed to go West from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> by the weekend. The crush of East Germans, who have also tried to flee this summer through <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, has created friction between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and several other nations and forced <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to close diplomatic facilities that have been overwhelmed by refugees in several <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc cities. The Austrian government source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> plan involves transporting the refugees from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and then to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The source said it was not yet clear if they would leave <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> by train or airplane. There was speculation that a West German envoy sent to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> today was trying to work out the reported plan. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> dispatched the senior diplomat to meet Austrian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Greinert </PERSON> said. The spokesman said <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> thanked Mock for <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s role in offering help to thousands of East Germans who had already fled across the Hungarian-Austrian border. He declined to comment on whether <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> was working on a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> plan. <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sztuchlik </PERSON>, head of the Foreign Relations department of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, said he had no knowledge of such a plan. In <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, however, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Szelei </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is working with both East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to deal with the refugees. The rush of refugees began in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> after reform-minded Communist Hungarian authorities began removing border fences in May. Some refugees say they are fleeing the hard-line Communist system in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but others say they are simply looking for a better economic life. Last week, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> allowed 108 East Germans holed up in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in a plan also organized by the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. But <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> said it was a one-time occurrence. There are 2,200 East Germans in camps set up by the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> for those who want to flee West, with 150 new arrivals each day, said <PERSON> Sztuchlik </PERSON>. At least 200 other East Germans are holed up in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s closed missions in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> hoping to go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where they receive automatic citizenship and assistance in starting a new life.

 A British official today said authorities will investigate whether security forces in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> leaked documents that helped <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> gunman identify a Roman Catholic man they later killed. However, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cope </PERSON>, the minister of state for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, also suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> group members made the claim to a reporter of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in order to discredit the police. <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said in a television report Tuesday that he had met with four masked men from the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UFF </ORGANIZATION>, over the weekend. He said he was taken to a house where he was shown the police documents and a videotape about suspected members of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the 60 percent <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the 95 percent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Among those named in the police material was 28-year-old <PERSON> Loughlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Maginn </PERSON>, who was shot to death Friday in his home in <LOCATION> Rathfriland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION>, a cover name for the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, claimed it killed <PERSON> Maginn </PERSON> because he was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maginn </PERSON>'s family has denied the claim and said he had been harassed by security forces for a year. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he was told the group got the documents through a `` breach of security at security force bases,'' but he said they did not elaborate. In his comments, <PERSON> Cope </PERSON> did not rule out that the documents could have been stolen rather than leaked. The Royal Ulster Constabulary, or <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION>, the police force of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province, also said it was investigating the claim. In his comments, <PERSON> Cope </PERSON> said, `` One can only speculate as to why the <ORGANIZATION> UFF </ORGANIZATION> have chosen to talk to the media in this way.'' `` Like the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> UFF </ORGANIZATION> has every reason to hate the <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION> whose efforts have put many of its members behind bars. It is not surprising that they will do their best to try to discredit the police and use the media for this purpose,'' he said. The government of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, which has a consultative role in the province's affairs, said it was seeking an `` urgent clarification'' on the report from the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government. The <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> was formed in September 1971 as a coordinator for paramilitary groups that supported continued British rule of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The Freedom Fighters group, like the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, is outlawed in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and its members are barred from appearing on television or radio. There have been past cases in which members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>, a local army unit that is being converted to a full-time force, were involved in sectarian murders. In 1980, several police informers were killed after the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> obtained information from reserve police officers.

<HEAD>Gallery Boycott Leads to Postponement of Exhibits</HEAD>

 A boycott by some artists of the Corcoran Gallery over its cancellation of a photography exhibit including pictures of genitalia has led to the `` indefinite postponement'' of two other scheduled contempory art exhibits, gallery officials said today. The scheduling and then cancellation in June of the exhibit by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> touched off a political controversy that resulted in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> moving to restrict federal subsidies for artists. The gallery said today contemporary artist <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemieux </PERSON> has pulled what it described as her `` first major one-person museum exhibition'' scheduled to run from Oct. 28 to Dec. 31. and that six scupltors also have canceled a show of their work scheduled to run from next Feb. 3 to April 8 <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>, acknowledged that l0 American painters, including Ms. <PERSON> Lemieux </PERSON>, featured in a joint U.S.-Soviet exhibition to be featured next spring also have threatened to deny the gallery the right to display their work. `` As far as we know, that show is still on,'' Ms. <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON> said of the spring 1990 exhibit _ `` 10 plus 10: Contemporary Soviet and American Painters,'' a touring show arranged by the <ORGANIZATION> Modern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION>. `` But we realize that the artists are upset.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lemieux </PERSON> notified the gallery in a letter last week that she was withdrawing her exhibit. A week earlier, two of the six sculptors in the exhibit titled `` The Resonance of the Odd Object,'' notified the Corcoran they were canceling their show. `` We believe the <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>, by its regrettable decision, not only compromised its own curatorial standards, but also demonstrated its complicity with the punishment subsequently attempted against other art instititions,'' sculptors <PERSON> Buss </PERSON> <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipski </PERSON> wrote. The Corcoran canceled the <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> exhibit two weeks before it was to go on display after protesting members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> objected to three pictures of genitalia and homosexual activities in it. The House later voted to cut the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>' budget by $ 45,000 _ the total of federal grants received by <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, a photographer whose picture of a crucifix in a jar of urine also touched off a protest And the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last month approved legislation by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, that would prohibit federal financng of sexually explict artwork. `` This is what we feared from day one,'' <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr-Cahall </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>'s director, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're in the middle of the storm.''

<HEAD>Group Says Fat-Laden Foods Barrier to Healthy School Lunches</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Free `` fat-laden foods'' given to schools by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are key obstacles to healthy school lunch programs, a consumer nutrition group said today. Sixty-seven percent of the school food service directors questioned this spring by <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s commodity distribution program is one of the most significant barriers to their efforts to provide nutritious meals. The school lunch programs depend upon commodities provided free of charge by the federal government to help them stay afloat financially, `` yet the commodities offered include a high proportion of fat-laden foods,'' said the report, which is a followup to previous studies assessing the progress being made to reduce fat in school lunches. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, acting administator of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the department is committed to dietary guidelines developed jointly with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. But he said the guidelines do n't set quantitative standards for fat, and `` there is no scientific consensus on appropriate levels of fat in children's diets.'' More than 80 percent of the directors agreed that efforts are needed to reduce fat in their school lunches and said they have taken some steps toward that end. Yet many of the directors said they were unaware that most health authorities agree that fat in children's diets should be reduced to about 30 percent of calories, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> said. Twenty-eight percent were uncertain of the proper average level of fat in school lunches. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> has provided only limited guidance to the directors on how to cut back on fat to achieve this level, such as through comprehensive hands-on training in meal preparation or guidance on working with food suppliers,'' said the study. Other findings included: _ Only 6 percent of the directors have established target levels or ranges for fat in their programs Central city school districts are eight times more likely to establish such limits than are rural districts. _ Twenty-three percent of those questioned said they did not receive any guidance or guidelines on how to purchase foods or modify recipes to reduce fat The rest reported having limited access to written materials or training programs. _ When asked to identify the single most important thing that could be done to help reduce fat, 50 percent said change the commodity program and 26 percent said provide nutrition education Public Voice recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> provide greater leadership in educating school food service directors and in offering assistance in planning monthly menus, including suggesting how often specific foods should be served. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also should significantly expand the availability of lower-fat commodities to the schools, the group added. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said `` it is important to remember that no matter what level is deemed appropriate, that level must be applied to a person's entire diet, not to a single food or a single meal <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> can not at this time support setting quantitative fat standards or recommended frequency of serving certain foods.'' The variety of foods donated to schools is under constant review, he said in a statement, adding that `` over the years significant progress has been made in providing more and more healthy, wholesome foods, including additional low-and reduced-fat foods.'' In addition, the agency promotes and coordinates nutrition education and technical assistance for all involved in the school lunch program, he said. But states `` have great flexibility in how they spend the money they have available for training.'' `` Technical assistance and educational materials have recently been revised and distributed to school food service directors,'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. `` These include recipe cards, a commodity foods newsletter and information on fat and cholesterol.''

 Three more judges resigned in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the nation's cocaine capital, after threats were made by drug lords seeking to halt a government crackdown on narcotics trafficking, authorities said today. Also today, <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> put the city under a 10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew to help combat the string of bombings and other attacks that have plagued the city. The resignations of three more judges brought to 108 the number of judges who have quit since the traffickers vowed Aug. 18 to retaliate against the government, police, journalists and others seen as a threat to the drug empire. The traffickers have said they will kill 10 judges for every Colombian extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stand trial on drug charges. The <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> magistrates, who resigned on Tuesday, had been investigating slayings believed to have been ordered by drug traffickers. The government, meanwhile, was reported to be preparing to extradite to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the first drug figure since the traffickers' terror campaign began two weeks ago. The effort to extradite <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, an alleged money manager for the traffickers, is seen a key test of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s will to battle the drug barons. He was arrested in the first days of an unprecedented offensive against trafficking, which began after gunmen hired by the cartel assassinated presidential hopeful Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> on Aug. 18. The syndicated TV news program `` Noticiero 24 Horas'' reported the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government notified <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> on Tuesday of plans to extradite him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He was told he had five working days, or until next Tuesday, to appeal. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics official had said earlier that the paperwork was going forward on an extradition request for <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a 35-year-old economist who faces federal charges in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in a $ 1.2 billion operation for laundering cocaine profits. He is being held under heavy guard by the investigations division of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s national police force. The television did not cite a source for its report. A presidential spokesman said he could not give any information, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> refuses to comment on extradition prceedings. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> re-established the country's extradition treaty as part of a series of emergency measures in the drug crackdown. In raids nationwide, police have seized more than $ 200 million in real estate including luxurious homes and office buildings, and other property such as airplanes, helicopters and cars. About 11,000 people have been taken into custody. Drug traffickers in turn have declared war on the state and responded with a wave of bombings and burnings, mostly in of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, 215 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> and the base for the world's largest cocaine trafficking cartel <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON>, father of three alleged kingpins in the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, Tuesday appealed in a letter to President Barco: `` Let there be dialogue, let there be peace.'' The nation's communications minister, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonds </PERSON>, responded by telling reporters: `` There will be no dialogue.'' <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, reputed leader of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, said <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s drug lords are prepared for total war if the government refuses to make peace, the French newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> said. He proposed ending the violence in comments over the weekend to a government agent, said the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> daily, which did not say how it obtained excerpts of the purported conversation. According to Liberation, <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> is in hiding in his refuge in <PERSON> Magdalena </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> in the country's Amazonian cocaine-processing region. He reportedly said drug traffickers would be willing to let the government keep all the property it has seized if narcotics chieftains were allowed to rejoin society. If the government declines the peace offer, Liberation quoted him as saying, `` There will be some deaths, always more deaths. I will give orders. Some journalists and some magistrates _ they will pay.'' fe U449 <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> police said Tuesday night they broke up a planned rocket attack on the state-run distillery that serves the stores. The liquor business is a rich source of patronage for <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>'s leading politicians, who have been a principle target in the drug traffiker's terror campaign A police spokesman said in a telephone interview that officers acting on a tip went to the distillery and found four imported, high-powered rockets. They were set up and aimed at the distillery's highly flammable alcohol storage tank, the spokesman said, who asked not to be identified The police spokesman said the rockets were similar to those found near a university when police frustrated an attempt to kill presidential hopeful <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> on Aug. 5. <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> was gunned down two weeks later at a political rally outside <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. The slaying capped a 48-hour wave of assassinations that shocked officials and prompted the anti-narcotics offensive.

<TEXT>
 Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a war hero and Olympic yachtsman who became one of the world's leading advocates of wildlife protection, has died, his environmental group said today. He was 79. The prominent conservationist suffered a heart attack Tuesday while visiting the western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> and died there, said the Wildlife and Wetlands Trust at <LOCATION> Slimbridge </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Severn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> estuary where <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> lived. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, who was a founder of the World Wildlife Fund, would have been 80 on Sept. 14. He was two years old when his father, Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcon </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, died in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> snows in 1912 after being beaten to the South Pole by a Norwegian, <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Amundsen </PERSON>. Capt. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> left a note to his wife in his hut saying, `` Make the boy interested in natural history; it is better than games.. Make him a strenuous man.'' His son said in later life that he felt having a hero for a father meant he had to do well in different fields by his own unaided effort. After studying art in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> became a celebrated bird artist, exhibiting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The royal family owns some of his paintings. He was an Olympic bronze medalist yachtsman in 1936 and three times decorated commander of destroyers and gunboats in World War II, when he also designed the camouflage adopted by the British Admiralty for all ships on duty in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. He was a champion glider pilot, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup helmsman in 1964 and the first Briton to be knighted, in 1973, for services to conservation. He wrote 18 books on natural history, illustrated 20 books by other authors and published three volumes of travel diaries and an autobiography, `` The Eye of the Wind,'' in 1961. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> was prominent in the movement to save whales, describing the whaling nations as `` international hooligans.'' In 1949, he explored the unmapped <LOCATION> Perry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> area of the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> and led expeditions of naturalists to <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australasia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Galapagos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seychelles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and three times to the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said he founded his wildfowl trust in 1946 as a haven for migrating geese and other water birds after shooting a goose and seeing it slowly die. `` I thought I would n't do that to my worst enemy so why should I do it to a goose,'' he recalled. In 1961, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> was one of the founders of the World Wildlife Fund, now known as the World Wide Fund for Nature, and designed its panda logo. `` The fact that the fund has gone from strength to strength and become the largest voluntary conservation organization in the world is a tribute to Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>'s vision, energy and determination,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Medley </PERSON>, director of the fund's British arm. In February, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> was named Conservationist of the Year by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magazine, Wildlife Art News. In May he was presented with the Conservation Medal of the National Zoological Park in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scott </LOCATION> is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Philippa </PERSON> <PERSON> Talbot-Ponsonby </PERSON>, and their son and daugther, and by a daughter from a previous marriage.

 The <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s largest city was closed today by a general strike protesting the death of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising activist who was shot by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. In <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, also in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, soldiers opened fire during a stone-throwing demonstration, wounding nine Palestinians, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The wounded included two 12-year-old boys shot in the legs with plastic bullets and a 22-year-old shot twice in the stomach, hospital officials said. An army spokesman said two soldiers also were injured when they were hit by stones thrown by demonstrators. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the military government completed the reopening of schools, which were closed for much of the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising, by allowing 10th and 11th grade students to return to class. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, stores and businesses were closed following the death Tuesday of <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayyab </PERSON>, 27, who was the leader of a PLO-backed students group at the closed <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He had been jailed four times without charges during the uprising. Masked youths set tires ablaze and threw up makeshift roadblocks in several neighborhoods in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which has a population of nearly 200,000 people. The town of <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Balah </PERSON>, where <PERSON> Jayyab </PERSON> was from, also was shut by a strike. No casualties were reported in the protest, but a 39-year-old municipal worker was shot several times by unknown assailants in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He was transferred to an Israeli hospital for surgery. After <PERSON> Jayyab </PERSON>'s death Tuesday, Palestinian witnesses said he was shot by soldiers after a firebomb was thrown at a military vehicle and during stone throwing at troops in downtown Palestine Square. The army said he was killed by army fire during a disturbance. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted a witness as saying <PERSON> Jayyab </PERSON> was shot in the face at close range. Officials at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> hospital, where the wounded <PERSON> Jayyab </PERSON> was brought by soldiers, said he died of a single bullet wound above the right eye. His death brought to 544 the number of Palestinians killed by soldiers or <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians during the uprising. At least 100 other Palestinians were slain by fellow <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> as alleged collaborators with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Thirty-eight Israeli also have been killed. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the army reported no violence as about 45,000 students returned to high school classes for the first time since January. The army closed all schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> early in the uprising, keeping more than 300,000 students from class. Officials maintained the schools served as hotbeds for organizing stone-throwing protests against soldiers. Schools were opened briefly twice, but each time they were shut again under military order. The latest phased re-opening, which started July 22, came following complaints by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and human rights groups that closure of schools was unfairly depriving Palestinian youths of an education. Schools remained open in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> throughout the uprising, except for individual institutions shut for brief periods following disturbances. Since West Bank classes resumed, the army has closed several individual schools where protests broke out.

 A judge today ordered state officials to release a carpenter who has been jailed for 18 months under the state's 156-year-old sodomy law after he admitted having oral sex with his wife. <ORGANIZATION> DeKalb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellani </PERSON> ordered the state to free <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> on his own recognizance by 3 p.m. unless a satisfactory reason for keeping him in jail is found. <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>, 35, was convicted in February 1988 on one charge of sodomy and sentenced to five years in prison after he testified that he engaged in oral sex with <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, his common-law wife of four years. The couple have since divorced, and Ms. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> won custody of their two children. <PERSON> Castellani </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> be freed until it could be determined if he should have a new trial or if his conviction should be overturned. <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, was charged with two counts of rape, two counts of aggravated oral sodomy and two counts of aggravated anal sodomy in connection with two encounters with Ms. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. He was acquitted of those charges, but a jury found him guilty of sodomy because of his admission on the witness stand. Sodomy, even between a consenting husband and wife, is a felony in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> is believed to be the first man convicted under the sodomy law for conduct between marriage partners. In today's hearing, <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, argued that state prosecutors should be required to disqualify themselves from the case if they had engaged in oral sex. <PERSON> Castellani </PERSON> declined to order prosecutors to reveal such information. The judge gave <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>'s attorneys until Tuesday to review transcripts from the original trial and to file additional motions in the case. They were seeking a writ of habeas corpus which, if granted, would void <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>'s conviction and free him. Failing that, he wants a new trial. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lister </PERSON>, <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>'s original lawyer, testified today that he advised <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> not to appeal the conviction because he believed an appeal would delay a release from the state Board of Pardons and Paroles. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Lister </PERSON>'s advice effectively deprived <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> of his right to appeal. Senior Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON> said the state was not trying to interfere in private marital relations, but became involved because of Ms. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' contention that she did not consent to the acts.

 A human rights group today protested the government's arrest of more than 50 journalists, lawyers and activists and charged that some of the detainees have been tortured. <PERSON> Bahi </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Din </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, deputy chief of the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s Egyptian chapter, alleged that the prisoners were beaten with cattle prods. Attorney General <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> said his department was investigating claims by detainees that they were tortured, but he refused to elaborate. Authorities arrested 55 journalists, lawyers and activists last week for allegedly taking part in a Communist conspiracy. More than 300 of the roughly 400 journalists working for the state-run newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION> have signed petitions seeking the release of their colleague, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON>, and two journalists from the leftist opposition weekly Al-Ahali. The arrest of <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> was the first time a reporter from one of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s three government-owned newspapers has been arrested since President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> took office in 1981. The protest by his colleagues at the state-run newspaper is highly unusual. The newspapers are not censored outright, but unlike the opposition press, they almost never criticize security policies or activities in their news or editorial columns. The three journalists were arrested Aug. 24 along with 52 other people in crackdowns on what security officials described as `` an underground Communist Party.'' The detainees include three lawyers and several workers, who authorities said were arrested with documents `` inciting change in the country's social and political system.'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the alleged torture occurred Monday in prison. He said two rows of security policemen flanked the detainees, beat them with electric cattle prods and dragged journalist <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> across the floor. He said <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> was tortured so badly that the prison warden was reluctant to let him meet the visiting head of the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION>, magazine editor <PERSON> Makram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>. The syndicate is the professional organization of Egyptian journalists. <PERSON> Amina </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafik </PERSON>, the syndicate's secretary-general and <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON>'s colleague at <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION>, concurred that the detainees had been beaten `` Some of them have been hurt,'' she said. She said, however, that when she visited on Tuesday, <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> looked well. Mrs. <PERSON> Shafik </PERSON> said the protest petitions do not refer to beatings or torture but urge `` improved treatment and release'' of the three journalists. She said 1988 Nobel Prize-winning writer <PERSON> Naguib </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahfouz </PERSON>, a regular columnist at <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION>, also signed the petition for presentation to `` various government points.'' <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> said he had seen no signs of torture but nevertheless demanded from prison officials `` better treatment and regular visits by a doctor. I'm sure treatment has improved now.'' He said <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> had been on a hunger strike and was in hysterics when he visited him Monday. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> said he persuaded <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> to end the strike.

 Telephone and mail service was disrupted Wednesday, the second day of a strike by 1,500 postal and communications workers.

Under emergency powers invoked by the government earlier this month, strikes by workers in essential services such as communications are outlawed, with violators risking dismissal, as well as a prison sentence of two years and a fine of about $ 450. No action was taken against the strikers by late Wednesday despite <PERSON> Mangwende </PERSON>'s warning. The protesters include most <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> telephone operators and communications technicians. Hundreds of telex machines were paralyzed and operator-service telephone calls were suspended. Incoming direct-dial telephone calls were still being received.

 Hotel queen <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was convicted today of tax evasion for charging personal expenses to her businesses but was acquitted of the most serious charge against her, extortion conspiracy. She was found guilty of 33 of the 41 federal counts on which she was tried. The counts on which she was convicted related to evading $ 1.2 million in taxes from 1983 to 1985. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, who with her husband runs a multibillion-dollar real estate empire, showed little emotion while the jury foreman read off the verdict, but occasionally shook her head. Her co-defendants, former aides <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>, were convicted of assisting in the tax-evasion scheme. <PERSON> Turco </PERSON>, who had been charged in the extortion conspiracy, was also acquitted on that charge. All three also were acquitted on mail fraud charges. Each of the 33 counts Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was convicted on carries a maximum prison term of three or five years. She could also face fines as high as $ 8 million. The extortion conspiracy charge carried a 20-year maximum sentence. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was allowed to remain free on bail pending sentencing Nov. 14. The judge and lawyers went into conference after the verdict was announced. As she waited, Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> slumped in her chair, occasionally talking with her bodyguard, grandson and niece. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 69, was depicted at the trial as arrogant, penny-pinching and mean-spirited. Her former housekeeper testified that Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> once told her, `` We do n't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.'' Her 80-year-old husband, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, was charged in the April 1988 indictment but was not tried because the judge found him mentally incompetent. The verdict came in the fifth day of deliberations in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The bulk of the expenses on which the tax charges were based were $ 3.1 million in renovations and operating costs at the lavish <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, mansion, Dunnellen Hall, which the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> purchased for $ 11 million in June 1983. Many of the bills were altered to make it appear the work was done at corporate entities. Prosecutors contended that the phony bills resulted in unreported income on the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> personal tax returns and incorrect business deductions on the corporate returns. The expenses included more than $ 1 million for a pool enclosure with a marble dance floor on the roof, jade figures worth $ 500,000, a $ 130,000 indoor-outdoor sound system similar to one Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> had admired in Disney World and thousands of dollars in landscaping work. The prosecution also alleged that $ 320,172 in Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s personal purchases were charged to the Park Lane Hotel, one of several luxury <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> hotels in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> These items ranged from tens of thousands of dollars in designer clothing to an $ 8 purchase of underwear. Another item was a $ 45,000 silver clock specially designed in the shape of the Helmsley Building, a birthday present to <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> from his wife. During the trial, the hotel's former comptroller quoted <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> as saying the accounting system at the <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION> was the `` Helmsley cheat-the-government system.'' The extortion conspiracy charge alleged that three liquor sales representatives were forced to kick back a percentage of their sales to keep accounts at Helmsley hotels. A former <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> executive, <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Meckler </PERSON>, testified that <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> once held up several envelopes and said, `` This is cash. This is what Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> wants.'' The extortion charge also covered three televisions for Dunnellen Hall that were allegedly extorted from the <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> while it was seeking a lucrative contract with her Cleveland-based <ORGANIZATION> Harley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> chain. <PERSON> Meckler </PERSON> testified that Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> joked with him, `` How many more can I get?'' Many of the 44 prosecution witnesses helped paint the harsh personal portrait of Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> that emerged during the eight-week trial. They described how she fired employees at the slightest provocation, disputed bills and always sought the lowest price. Defense attorney <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> attempted to discredit the witnesses as disgruntled ex-employees who had a vendetta against Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, whom he described as tough and abrasive. <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> had argued that the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> did nothing wrong in billing their companies for part of the expenses at Dunnellen Hall because they used the estate for business. He tried to explain away the phony bills by saying her employees devised the scheme to avoid contact with Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, who many times refused to pay contractors if she was not fully satisfied with their work. <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> had repeatedly pointed out that the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 57.8 million in taxes during the time period of the indictment. The defense presented testimony from four witnesses, including two tax experts who said the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> actually overpaid $ 591,000 in federal taxes in 1983-85 by underreporting the depreciation of buildings in Helmsley-controlled partnerships.

 Two passenger trains collided head-on in western <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> today, killing at least one person and injuring 27 people, a railway spokesman said. Three cars derailed when the trains crashed while traveling at relatively low speeds between <LOCATION> Bregenz </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Voralberg </LOCATION> province, and the small town of <LOCATION> Wolfurt </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. Authorities found one body in the wreckage. The <ORGANIZATION> Austria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> identified the victim as <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, a 48-year-old engineer from <LOCATION> Bodolz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Sixteen people, including the drivers of each train, were hospitalized and 11 other people treated for slight injuries, a railroad spokesman on condition of anonymity. The spokesman said 72 passengers were on the `` Montfort,'' the express train between <LOCATION> Bregenz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>; and 75 were on the `` <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>,'' the express train between <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>. The railway spokesman said it seemed that human error was probably to blame since the `` Montfort'' had been erroneously switched to the same track as the other train. The crash occurred in <LOCATION> Voralberg </LOCATION> near the site of a train accident that killed five people and injured 46 exactly one year ago, on Aug. 29, 1988.

<TEXT>
 Researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> say they have bad news for international chess grandmaster <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> _ computers could overtake the best human players in just a few years. `` I'd say four years is a very generous estimate, in fact,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CMU </ORGANIZATION> computer scientist <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON>, the brains behind <ORGANIZATION> Hitech </ORGANIZATION>, a computer that won its third straight <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> State Championship over the weekend in <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>. Hitech's five-game sweep at the tournament raised its <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> ranking to 2,411, up about 400 points from the rating it achieved after it began playing in 1985. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, the world champion, ranks above 2,800. A beginner typically rates about 1,200. Hitech is winning about 80 percent of its games and ranks among the top 150 players in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but never has beaten a grandmaster, the federation's highest rank. <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> and a changing team of graduate students have worked since 1985 to boost Hitech's speed and ability. `` Any person who can improve 100 points a year will probably become a world champion very soon,'' <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Getting up to 2,000 is not something many players achieve.'' Hitech is n't even the fastest or most powerful chess computer. It ranks second in the world, behind another <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON> creation, Deep Thought, <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> said. `` It's becoming fairly obvious that Deep Thought, which is 20 times faster than Hitech, already can play with the best players in the country. It's not going to take too much more improvement,'' he said. Many of the best human chess players are turning down invitations to match wits against machines in tournament play, however. Four of the players seeded above sixth-seeded <PERSON> Hitech </PERSON> declined to play the computer at the state championship. The fifth person lost. Participants in tournaments do n't have to play a computer if they do n't want to. `` When we were first being invited to play, it was for fun. Nobody expected it to win,'' <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> said. But he added, `` Players are starting to refuse to play because it's no longer an easy touch.'' The best human players rely on experience, intuition and knowledge of chess theory. Computers play mathematically, computing the consequences of various moves. Hitech can consider more than 175,000 board positions per second before picking the best one. Hitech also can recognize patterns of moves. Computer chess is advancing the field of artificial intelligence, and lessons learned could help humans make complex judgments in other areas of life, <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> said. `` When they invented the steam shovel, the people who dug ditches also were very upset,'' he said. `` But look at what a great improvement that turned out to be.''

 <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> are blocking <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s attempt to join an international conference on chemical weapons, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> diplomat said today. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in June submitted its application to join the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament, which officially accepts new participants only by consensus. The conference concludes its summer session Thursday. <PERSON> Pinhas </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliav </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, said officials told him that <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, `` helped to a certain degree by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' opposed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s bid for observer status. The two other Arab members, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, did not raise objections, he added. The request still is pending, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> plans to pursue it when delegates reconvene in February. `` We did n't want to press it too much because we did n't think it was worth it,'' <PERSON> Eliav </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We did n't want to fight it out.'' <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials say one reason for the application is concern over the spread of chemical weapons in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Western diplomats will lobby Arab delegations in the conference recess in an effort to obtain a consensus because `` it would not be productive'' to force the issue to a vote now, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Eliav </PERSON> suggested <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> was retaliating for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and Western moves to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> from gaining full membership in international organizations. Among the 22 non-members participating in the chemical weapons talks are <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, all believed to have chemical arms capabilities. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is believed to have stocks of nerve gas and mustard gas. The disarmament conference has been debating a global convention outlawing the production, stockpiling and use of chemical arms. Several new observers joined this year after a special 149-nation conference on chemical weapons in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> attempted to spur the negotiations on a draft treaty. Delegates on Tuesday reported that the latest round made progress on technical points but again failed to remove major stumbling blocks, including disagreements over verification.

 Widespread thievery has deprived Chinese officials of one of their most treasured privileges: access to telephones that work. The Worker's Daily said Wednesday that 420 miles of telephone line have been stolen this year in the southern island province of <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION>, and that lines or equipment have been damaged in 18 <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION> cities. It said thieves have preyed on the exclusive lines linking government offices. The lines are far clearer than the static-filled lines used by ordinary citizens. An important line from the southern <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Sanya </LOCATION> to the provincial government in <LOCATION> Haikou </LOCATION> was cut for two months from February, and then cut again after it was repaired in April. The thieves, mostly peasants who sell the copper wire, made off with 37 -LCB- miles of a 49-mile stretch between <LOCATION> Sanya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tongshi </LOCATION> and 69 out of 87 -LCB- miles of line linking another two towns. When the provincial government tried to hold a telephone conference with <LOCATION> Tongshi </LOCATION> city on Aug. 17, it found the line was dead, the report said. Officials switched to a backup line that worked for only eight minutes before being cut by thieves.

<HEAD>British Report To Release CIA File, Reject Waldheim Claims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An unpublished British report rejects testimony by Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and includes a secret <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> file which identifies <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> as a Nazi intelligence officer, the World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The British <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday that the report, ordered by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to determine whether <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was linked to the execution of six British commandos in World War II, will be released in a few weeks. Speculation has arisen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that some evidence may be suppressed because of possible post-war links between <LOCATION> Waldheim </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence services. But World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> executive director <PERSON> Elan </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said he has learned the report will include a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> file of April 26, 1945, which contains an interrogation conducted by British military intelligence of a Nazi officer who identified <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> as an intelligence officer. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s organization found out about the file by petitioning the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> under the Freedom of Information Act. But he said that the agency refused to release the document because it was obtained from British intelligence. The file proves that <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities knew about <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past when they supported his nomination for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary general in the 1970s, he added. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was elected president in 1986 and placed on a list of undesirable foreigners by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which found he had `` assisted and otherwise participated'' in deportation of Jewish prisoners to death camps and execution of Allied prisoners. An international commission of historians appointed by the Austrian government found <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> lied about his activities in World War II and knew about Nazi atrocities but did nothing to stop them. The commission said it could not prove a connection between <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> and the British commandos captured in the <LOCATION> Balans </LOCATION> in 1944, but suggested he knew they were shot by the Gestapo after their interrogation by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> intelligence officers. In written testimony presented by his lawyers to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> denied taking part in any interrogations, saying no questioning of prisoners was conducted at the field headquarters where he was stationed near the Greek town of <LOCATION> Saloniki </LOCATION>. But the British report shows the commandos were interrogated at the headquarters where <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> served and that some of them were subsequently handed over to the Gestapo for `` special handling,'' the euphemism for execution, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. Among documents made available to the British investigation are papers with <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s initials showing he was clearly aware the commandos were handed over to the Gestapo, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. He said the World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had gleaned its information about the British report from documents it had supplied at the investigators' request and from people who have seen the completed findings. The report will not make any judgment of criminality about <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s activities, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said.

 A witness testifying in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s fraud and conspiracy trial collapsed on the stand today during questioning, and court was recessed for the day after paramedics carried him out on a stretcher. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executive, had testified before becoming ill that the ministry was so overbooked with `` lifetime partnerships'' that he warned <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and former aide <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> that they could go to prison for the programs. The partnership programs promised donors three nights of free lodging each year for life in exchange for $ 1,000 donations to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. `` I told them I thought we had some big-time problems,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. `` I specifically said, ` Someone could go to jail for this.''' <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> responded that <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> officials had checked out the partnership programs with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> officials and were assured that no laws had been broken, said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who became <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for world outreach in 1985.

After paramedics took <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> away on a stretcher, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> recessed court for the day. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is on trial on federal charges of fraud and conspiracy. Prosecutors say he and other <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executives diverted more than $ 4 million of the $ 158 million raised through partnership programs to their own uses. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, 57, agreed on Aug. 8 to plead guilty to two counts of wire fraud and one count each of mail fraud and conspiracy. The plea bargain came three weeks before he was scheduled to stand trial with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> was sentenced Aug. 24 to eight years in prison and fined $ 200,000. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, expected to be a key witness in the trial, was himself hospitalized in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for undisclosed reasons. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> had also been admitted in April to <LOCATION> Morton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, for chest pains. Hospital spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramblin </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Safety </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, asked doctors not disclose details of his condition. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dash </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office refused to discuss the effects of <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>'s hospitalization on the proceedings. He said <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> was not expected to be called this week. Prosecution witnesses Tuesday portrayed <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> as an evangelist of extravagance, but attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder say he was a busy minister concerned with saving souls. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, a former aide to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> convicted of tax evasion, testified that the televangelist pursued an extravagant lifestyle and was enchanted with real estate. `` He told me he wanted to have 10 homes,'' <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rule </PERSON>, a former computer programmer for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, testified he went to his superiors with concerns that the partnerships were oversold, numbering 64,000 in September 1985 despite <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s self-imposed limit of 25,000 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> vice president, testified he relayed those concerns to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and another executive during a brief meeting at the ministry's television studio. `` They told me not to worry about it,'' <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said. Former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> advertising writer <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> testified that a campaign for the partnerships offered a <PERSON> David </PERSON> and Goliath sculpture said to be worth $ 1,000. But the ministry only paid $ 10 for them, she said. A silver version of the sculpture in <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s office might have been worth $ 1,000, she said. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> always accepted bonuses from the board, even after objecting to them. The board in 1985 approved borrowing $ 800,000 for operating expenses while voting <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> a $ 200,000 bonus, <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> complained during a visit to Oral <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, that he did n't live as well as other evangelists, <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said. `` They were showing us around,'' he said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said that he lived shabbily compared to Oral Roberts, the -LRB- Rex -RRB- <PERSON> Humbards </PERSON> and other ministers.'' <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said electric bills at <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s lakefront parsonage in <LOCATION> Tega </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, usually ran about $ 1,800 to $ 2,000 a month because `` the pool was kept at a very high temperature ... in the 90s.'' The witness also recounted moving the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' clothing and other belongings in 1984 from <LOCATION> Tega </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cay </LOCATION> to a house they owned in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. He said the move was made on a private jet at a cost to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> of $ 105,000. After The Charlotte Observer reported on the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' extravagant homes, vacations and vintage cars, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> hired a private investigator for at least $ 5,000 to follow the newspaper's publisher, editor and a reporter, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>. The newspaper won a Pulitzer prize for its reporting, and <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> has a book coming out next month on the rise and fall of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his ministry. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> quit <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 amid revelations about his 1980 sexual encounter with church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and a $ 265,000 payoff for her silence. If convicted of all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined $ 5 million. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> James </PERSON> each face 25 years in prison and $ 1 million in fines for their tax evasion convictions. The two were convicted in July of evading $ 525,000 in federal income taxes on $ 1.2 million they received from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. In cross examination of <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, defense attorney <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> asked about <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> checklists that included subjects ranging from hotel cleanliness and providing ministers to counsel people after a service. `` So Mr. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was not only taking care of the day-to-day things at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> _ the lights, the cleanliness _ he was also looking out for the spiritual welfare of his congregation, was n't he?'' <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> asked. `` Yes, salvation was important,'' <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>'Twas Scurvy Killed the King, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 King <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>, renowned for his appetite for women and power, was killed by his craving for meat, a historian has concluded. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Maclean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kybett </PERSON>, writing in the September issue of History Today, argues that <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> died in 1547 of scurvy, a disease caused by a lack of fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C. Or as the headline in Wednesday's Guardian newspaper put it: `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> was a scurvy knave.'' The king, Ms. <PERSON> Kybett </PERSON> said, displayed a number of symptoms of scurvy: swollen, ulcerated legs, bad breath, frequent colds, constipation, lethargy, forgetfulness, bloating and wild mood swings. It could have been <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, she wrote, that the Elizabethan writer <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Stubbes </PERSON> had in mind in this blast against the English diet: `` For who is sicklier than they that fare deliciously every day? Who is corrupter? Who belcheth more? Who looketh worse, who is weaker and feebler than they? Who hath more filthy color, phlegm and putrifaction -LRB- replete with gross humors -RRB- than they? `` And, to be brief, who dyeth sooner than they?'' Significantly, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> was usually sick during Lent, when fasting coincided with a lack of nutritious food, Ms. <PERSON> Kybett </PERSON> wrote. `` But nobody in the Tudor era associated foods with health. They hoped in vain that the green and golden concoctions of the alchemist would bring a cure.'' It was once believed that <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, who died at age 56, succumbed to syphilis, but that theory has been discredited. A cure for scurvy was unknown until Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lind </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> published `` A Treatment of the Scurvy'' in 1735. Sailors were frequent sufferers from scurvy until it was discovered that they could be protected by citrus fruits _ hence the term `` Limey'' for British, from the lime juice rations that were given to seamen. Ms. <PERSON> Kybett </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> who lives in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said that the English of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>'s time had no techniques for preserving fruits and vegetables. <PERSON> Nicander </PERSON> <PERSON> Nucius </PERSON>, an Italian who visited <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in the last two years of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>'s life, commented on the `` sottish and unrestrained'' appetites of the natives, and another Italian at the time remarked that fruit was scarce, `` because they lack the great heat of summer.'' The English, at least those who could read and afford books, had been warned against fruits. In `` Castel of <ORGANIZATION> Helth </ORGANIZATION>,'' published in 1539, the physician Sir <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Elyot </PERSON> had warned that fruits `` do ingender ylle humors and be oftetymes the cause of putrified fevers, if they be moche and continually eaten.'' Judging from armor made for <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> in later life, his waist had ballooned to 54 inches, just 3 inches less than his chest. In his younger days, the king had a trim 35-inch waist and a chest of 42 inches. Ms. <PERSON> Kybett </PERSON> said two of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>'s children, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, showed signs of scurvy, as did <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>'s high-living chancellor, Cardinal <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolsey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wolsey </PERSON>, a victim of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>'s moods, died in 1530 while going to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to face trial for treason. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> was married six times. His eagerness to divorce his first wife, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Aragon </PERSON>, who had failed to bear a son, precipitated the English church's break with <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>.

 A 94-car freight train collided with a tractor-trailer rig today, killing two people, derailing at least 19 cars and snarling traffic for miles, police said. It was not immediately clear how many of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> freight train cars left the tracks; reports ranged from 19 to 30 cars. Many of the train's cars were empty and it was not known what the others held. Officials said they did not contain hazardous materials.

Their identities were not released. Three people aboard the train were reported injured, although none seriously. The train and truck, leased to <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frozen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, collided about 6:20 a.m. on a major city thoroughfare, said state police Lt. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crain </PERSON>. The accident, near the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> University-Shreveport </LOCATION> campus, tied up traffic in the area for miles, officials said.

The <ORGANIZATION> Shreveport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> quoted eyewitnesses as saying the accident occurred when the truck drove past warning lights in front of the train.

<HEAD>Some Artists Boycott Corcoran Gallery Over Exhibit Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An artist boycott has forced the cancellation of two scheduled exhibitions at the Corcoran Gallery, which in June amid a swirling political controversy abruptly canceled a show that included sexually explicit photos. Gallery officials said Wednesday that contemporary artist <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemieux </PERSON> has withdrawn her one-woman show scheduled for Oct. 28 to Dec. 31 and that an exhibit by six sculptors scheduled for next Feb. 3 to April 8 also has been `` indefinitely postponed.'' `` We're hoping to reschedule both at some point,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the private gallery, which has been trying in recent years to establish itself as a showcase for contemporary art. Ms. <PERSON> Lemieux </PERSON>, whose work was subsidized by the federal government through the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, described the withdrawal of her show as a `` indefinite postponement ... until they -LRB- the Corcoran -RRB- demonstrate a definite change in policy.'' Both she and two of the six sculptors said in letters to the gallery their decisions were based on the <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>'s cancellation in June of an exhibit of 150 photographs by the late <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON>, who died last March from AIDS. `` We believe the <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>, by its regrettable decision, not only compromised its own curatorial standards, but also demonstrated it complicity with the punishment subsequently attempted against other art instititions,'' wrote sculptors <PERSON> Buss </PERSON> <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipski </PERSON>. The Mapplethrope exhibit _ which included photographs of children's genitalia, homoerotic and sadomasochistic images _ became embroiled in a vehement controversy over the federal funding of sexually explicit art through the National Endowment of the Arts. The exhibit, which toured several other museums, was funded partially through a $ 15,000 grant by the endowment. Since then, congressional critics led by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Armey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, have pushed bills through the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> cutting the endowment's budget and restricting the type of art it can fund. `` This is what we feared from day one,'' <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr-Cahall </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>'s director told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're in the middle of the storm.'' Ms. <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON> said 10 American painters, including Ms. <PERSON> Lemieux </PERSON>, featured in a joint U.S.-Soviet exhibition to be featured next spring also have threatened to deny the gallery the right to display their work. `` As far as we know, that show is still on,'' she said of the spring 1990 exhibit _ `` 10 plus 10: Contemporary Soviet and American Painters,'' a touring show arranged by the <ORGANIZATION> Modern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION>. `` But we realize that the artists are upset.''

<HEAD>Cambodia Peace Conference Fails</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with conference issuing final statement,
deciding to suspend its work. No pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Delegates at an international conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> failed to produce a peace accord today and decided to suspend their work until the warring factions are ready to compromise. Last-minute haggling delayed by seven hours the issuing of a final statement that fell far short of the comprehensive settlement delegates from 19 nations hoped to achieve when the meeting opened in late July. The statement _ issued as the delegates began a last plenary session that was expected to be brief _ said the meeting had `` achieved progress in elaborating a wide variety of elements necessary for the reaching of a comprehensive settlement to the tragic conflict in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' But, it added, `` It is not yet possible to achieve a comprehensive settlement. It was therefore decided to suspend the conference.'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, whose representatives chaired the meeting, offered to assist in mediating within the next six months between the Vietnam-installed government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and the three resistance factions led by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the hereditary ruler of the Southeast Asian nation. The delegates left open the possiblity of using the committees set up under the auspices of the international conference as a forum for future talks between the belligerents. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> `` will begin consultations within six months with the participants in the conference with a view to reconvening the conference,'' the statement said. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> called the conference when it appeared that an international political climate of greater cooperation favored a possible settlement. But over three weeks of negotiations in small working groups, the positions among the Cambodian factions hardened. The failure at the negotiating table in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> increased the liklihood of full-scale civil war after the scheduled withdrawal of 26,000 Vietnamese troops before Sept. 27, some delegates said. `` It will be like <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>; there will be more fighting,'' said the spokesman for the <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> delegation, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Koh </PERSON>. `` The two sides are preparing for war, they're already fighting.'' `` The parties wo n't come back until they've tested each other on the battlefield and have reached an impasse,'' <PERSON> Koh </PERSON> said. Negotiations broke down over five points, including the composition of a transitional government after the troop pullout, a mechanism for monitoring the withdrawal and the use of the word `` genocide'' in describing the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rule between 1975 and the Vietnamese invasion three years later, French Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is believed to have killed 1 million Cambodians during its rule. Intransigence marked the meeting up until the end, delaying the final plenary session that was scheduled to begin in the morning but was delayed until late afternoon. The points of disagreement included an item in a draft of the final statement calling for the Cambodian parties to intensify their `` efforts to achieve national reconciliation.'' Both <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, who supports the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> resistance, and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> objected to the reference national reconciliation, and the wording was deleted. Their position remains that the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government led by <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> is strictly a Vietnamese puppet. In a statement released on the last day of the conference, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said that the resistance would reject any international monitoring of the troop withdrawal `` before the dismantling of the illegal regime of <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> and its replacement by a Cambodian provisional quadrapartite government'' composed of the three resistance members and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised today to keep trying `` to hold the line on taxes'' and to fight for a lower tax on capital gains. Speaking to an appreciative audience of fellow residents and merchants of this summer resort, the vacationing president appealed for their support as he heads back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next week to grapple with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over taxes and the deficit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later in the day was welcoming Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and family to his oceanfront home, where he has spent the past two weeks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, standing on a blue-draped temporary platform erected on a hotel shuffleboard court, with the rocky coastline and blue waters of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> at his back, noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Kennebunk-Kennebunkport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> was composed of `` a lot of entrepreneurs.'' `` I'd be remiss at a meeting like this if I did n't ask you to give me strong support as I go back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to fight for a capital gains tax differential,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to reduce the levy on capital gains _ profits made from the sale of property or securities _ from 28 percent to 15 percent but has met resistence from Democrats who control <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Calling small businesses `` the backbone of this country in any ways,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wants to reduce the levy to stimulate the economy and reward `` those who have the courage to go off on their own and start new businesses.'' `` I do believe we're going to get a good agreement on the budget deficit reduction package. I think it will be accomplished without raising the taxes on the American working man,'' the president said. `` I am going to continue to try to hold the line on taxes,'' he told the crowd of several hundred. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no apologies for his 20-day vacation, which ends on Labor Day. `` We are doing some work, but I have confessed at the very outset that this is a pure, total vacation, and I'm not going to look busy in order to convince people in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that it's something other than a vacation,'' he said to applause. `` It's the way it is.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he planned to call the editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Portland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and ask him to stop running a graphic chronicling his futility at fishing. He said this morning he was at the helm when a companion caught a bluefish. `` I think they should knock off that advertisement on the front of the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> paper that shows a bluefish with a big ` X' through it telling me that yet a 13th day I have n't caught one,'' he said. `` I'm going to appeal to them on that one.'' The president said this was a place where he and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> `` refurbish our souls and get our batteries all charged up and enjoy life really to the fullest.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has spent every summer of his life here except 1944, when he was flying <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bombers in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> during World War II. A bright sun broke through the morning haze and clouds in time for the Chamber of Commerce event. `` I ca n't wait to show off this heaven to the prime minister of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, his wife and his four kids,'' he told the local boosters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser said Tuesday that U.S.-Canadian relations are in good shape thanks to progress on acid rain and trade as the two leaders hold their friendly, private visit. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Mila </PERSON> and their four children were to arrive in late afternoon at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point compound for an overnight visit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, said Tuesday the private visit would give the two leaders `` a chance to relax -LRB- and -RRB- a chance to exchange views'' on world events, including the dramatic changes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as well as the crises in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said the two old friends share `` a close similarity of views ... on world affairs and a kind of unique personal closeness and frankness in exchanging views.'' Scowcroft said U.S.-Canadian ties are `` in basically pretty good shape,'' with efforts under way to implement the sweeping Free Trade Agreement signed last year by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed revision of the Clean Air Act, which would seek to sharply curb emissions from utility plants, factories and other sources of pollutants that cause acid rain, `` has set us on the road to dealing with one of the other major problems between us, that is the issue of cross-border pollution'' such as acid rain.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the country: Aug. 25 <LOCATION> Owatonna </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on education: <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> did not actually point an accusing finger at educators and schools when he complained of rising education costs and falling returns. He was careful to say parents, teachers and all Americans must become involved if education is to succeed. But his underlying tone was an accusatory one _ once again, he implied, education is falling down on the job. If <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> genuinely believes such a direct relationship can be discerned between money spent on education and children's achievement, he does not understand how people learn It is not the fault of the education system that families break apart and create insecure homes for kids, keeping their minds off learning. It is not the fault of the educational system that children are abused, throwing up barriers to learning. It is not the fault of the educational system that teen-agers get pregnant and, to compound the problem, try to raise their babies themselves, in poverty. A failure in education is a failure in society as a whole. We can not mend our school system until we mend our social failings. It is a cyclical relationship; to a large degree, education is the answer to our social failings. The circuit breaker we need is in the cycle of poverty and crime, not in the money we spend on education. Then again, it is possible that <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> realizes these complexities. If so, he is playing politics with children's futures and that is unforgivable.

 Aug. 23 The News Tribune, <LOCATION> Woodbridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, on the cost of AZT: The encouraging news that the drug AZT will stall the deadly effect of the AIDS virus is dampened by the news that the bill for this drug might approach $ 5 billion annually. Should limited public funds be used to help these patients with their terminal virus, or should they be used to help poor women get proper prenatal care, or allow poor schoolchildren hot lunches? Providing AZT to all who need it, regardless of their ability to pay, is the compassionate thing to do. But is it fiscally responsible to do so in a nation with a mounting debt and an exploding health bill? What this dilemma does is offer an additional reminder that massive education, and changes in habits are needed to prevent the spread of this preventable disease. It also highlights the need for research to find a cure for AIDS as well as the need for discovery of affordable means of treatment.

 Protesters blocked railroad tracks and battled police during nationwide demonstrations Wednesday against Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. Officials said 11 people were killed and more than 100,000 arrested. The nationwide strike shut down commerce and transportation in six states controlled by opposition parties but had less effect in the 19 states governed by <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. Several clashes broke out between government supporters and opposition demonstrators and at least four people died when a bomb was thrown at a bus, police said. Police used batons and tear gas to break up crowds nationwide, news reports said. At least 80 people were injured and 103,450 were arrested nationwide, police said. Opposition parties had called the strikes to focus attention on alleged government corruption. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> must call new parliamentary elections later this year and the strike has been perceived as being the start of the opposition's campaign. The strike closed shops, businesses and schools and stopped rail and transport services in the six opposition-government states. In other regions, it evoked only a limited response although there was a drop in business activity and attendance at schools, colleges and offices. About 2,700 people, including 16 lawmakers, were arrested for sitting on railroad tracks to block trains in southern <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> state, police said. Press Trust said at least 11 people were killed in clashes involving police and pro- and anti-government factions. It said seven deaths were reported from the northeastern state of <LOCATION> Tripura </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, in fighting between members of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Four people were killed in the states of <LOCATION> Kerala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>, both governed by the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, it said. V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, the leader of an opposition coalition trying to unite political groups against <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, said the strike was a success. `` We are very confident of the future,'' he said at a news conference. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> had called the strike and was supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> and the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Federal Home Minister <PERSON> Buta </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> claimed the strike failed and that `` the forces that inspired it have been decisively defeated.'' He said that except in the opposition-ruled states, citizens rejected the strike call and federal government organizations nationwide functioned normally. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, thousands of government employees slept in their offices Tuesday night so they could report to work on Wednesday. The government had threatened not to pay them the day's salary if they missed work. Food and bedrolls were provided for employees and senior executives were given rooms in luxury hotels, said officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The strike brought to a climax the opposition's campaign against alleged corruption in the government. Last month, 106 opposition members in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> resigned, saying a government audit into a controversial arms deal proved kickbacks were paid to senior officials and <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s party. Opposition leaders say a Swedish company, <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION>, paid $ 50 million in kickbacks and bribes to secure a $ 1.4 billion contract to supply artillery guns to the Indian army. The government denies the charge. Parliamentary elections must be called before January. The strike was a rare show of unity for the normally fractured opposition. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won 415 out of the 544 parliamentary seats in the last general elections in 1985. Political analysts say any chance the opposition could have for winning the next election lies in its ability to put up concensus candidates and avoid splitting the anti-Congress vote. The only time the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has lost an election in independent <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was when the opposition united in 1977. But that government fell apart less than three years later when the fragile coalition splintered.

<TEXT>
 Two small planes collided in flight and crashed, one bursting into flames, and all four people on board were killed, authorities said. Searchers combed the area today for clues to the cause of the crash, which occurred about 8 p.m. Tuesday about a mile west of <LOCATION> Harvey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> near the small Puget Sound-area town of <LOCATION> Snohomish </LOCATION>. Elsewhere, a small plane crashed in front of a trailer park in <LOCATION> Moose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, Tuesday night, killing the pilot and a passenger. No one on the ground was believed injured. In the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> crash, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> duty officer <PERSON> Gini </PERSON> <PERSON> Bright </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> said the planes were a Beechcraft Bonanza BE-35 `` V-tail'' with three occupants, and a <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 152 carrying only the pilot. <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> investigator, said it appeared that the Bonanza had left <LOCATION> Paine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, five miles away, earlier in the day and was returning when the accident took place. `` It would appear ... that one was climbing and one was descending and they failed to observe each other,'' <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> said. The planes were n't under direction of air traffic controllers, and the pilots were responsible for watching for other craft, he said, adding that the weather was clear. `` This is the worst possible mix _ a high-wing <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> can not see up and the Bonanza is a low wing and ca n't see below. We do n't know yet which was on top, but if history is any indicator, it worked that way.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Snohomish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Harvey </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Bonanza </LOCATION>, kept at <LOCATION> Paine </LOCATION>, is owned by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehew </PERSON> of <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON>. Officials have not yet determined who was flying the planes. The names of the dead were not immediately available, said <LOCATION> Snohomish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's dispatch superviser <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. One of the planes came close to hitting a horse barn, while the second plane hit the ground several hundred yards away, said <LOCATION> Snohomish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's office spokeswoman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON>. The Beechcraft burst into flames on impact; the <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> did not, she said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was also investigating. The <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> crash took place about 7:40 p.m. Tuesday on a road in front of the Don Bean trailer park, said dispatcher <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Carlton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The plane's wreckage was up against a vacant trailer used as a model. The home did n't appear to be damaged.

 An <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet made an emergency landing at an airport today after one of its three hydraulic systems failed, an airline spokesman said.

 Aug. 26 South Bend -LRB- Ind. -RRB- Tribune on Voyager 2: If you yawned it had to be the hour, not the event. Not since our distant ancestors emerged from the caves has humankind been treated to such sights. The marvelous journey of Voyager 2 to the edge of the solar system humbled and excited at the same time, as great human achievements have always done. The pictures of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and its mysterious moons may have lacked the clarity of a telecast game show, but they were vivid testimony of what man can do in his better moments. What scientists have dreamed about for decades was delivered to you on your own TV screen. ... Putting it all in perspective will take time. Drama aside, the information supplied by Voyager 2 is of enormous value in our understanding of the universe. ... The thousands of scientists and technicians involved in the Voyager expedition deserve a warm salute from those of us who sit wondering in front of the tube. As it sinks in, we can be permitted to wonder about this strange creature called man. We can reach out to the stars; we can eliminate a scourge such as polio, but tolerate war and hunger. If we can do some great things, why not others?

Guided by a handful of appointed experts, it moves interest rates up and down as it pleases. It is accountable to no one. Its deliberations are conducted in secret. Its decisions may not be appealed. All that is true, and let us be grateful. The alternative _ at least the alternative favored by ... <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> _ is to authorize the congressionally run <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to audit the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s monetary transactions, which are now protected from such scrutiny, and recommend changes It is not difficult to see how this would give <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, whose impulses are unfailingly political, leverage over the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s decisions ... <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> also wants to make the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary a voting member of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, thereby enhancing <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> influence, too. In justification, he argues that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s monetary policy is not democratic enough. Of course it is n't democratic. It is not supposed to be democratic. The genius of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is precisely that it insulates monetary decisions from politics. ... The purpose of the <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> bill is as plain as it is alarming. ... <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> hopes to undermine the independence of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, the economy's chief protection against a free-wheeling, free-spending, politically driven <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The mechanism may not be perfect, but it works. Only at our enormous peril will <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> be permitted to `` adjust'' it.

<TEXT>
 Police arrested more than 200 women, including the wife of Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, during a protest march in central <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> as part of a nationwide defiance campaign. Many of the women, blacks and whites, sat on the street and chanted freedom songs before police led or carried them into vans. In <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, eight blacks and two whites were arrested for trying to desegregate the capital's whites-only buses, another phase of the defiance campaign. The two whites were women who bought bus tickets for blacks. Twice this week, shots have been fired into the homes of organizers of the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> campaign. Police stopped the throng of placard-carrying women in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> after they emerged from a church hall to begin a march to the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. They intended to ask <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to protest the South African government's handling of student unrest in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> area and to intercede on behalf of three black activists facing execution for a 1986 killing. In addition to <PERSON> Leah </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, those arrested included <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, a white who heads the Black Sash civil rights group, and <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, wife of the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, a prominent mixed-race activist who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> of Reformed Churches. Many of the marchers sat in a street adjoining a small plaza until they were led into police vans and driven away. Scores of onlookers cheered them. Police said the women would be charged with participating in an illegal gathering. A white activist involved in the defiance campaign, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofmeyer </PERSON>, was admitted to a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> hospital Wednesday with suspected internal bleeding, his father said. <PERSON> Hofmeyer </PERSON> has been on a hunger strike since he was detained by police last week during a protest at a branch of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, sponsor of an ongoing tour by an international rugby team which activists say violates the sports boycott of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The South African Council of Churches, which supports the defiance campaign, announced plans for an outdoor rally Saturday in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the vast black township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The church council's general secretary, the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, said the rally was intended as a forum for blacks to express their opposition to the white-controlled government in a peaceful manner. Outdoor rallies are illegal unless authorized by the government, and <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said he hoped Saturday's event would be approved. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> are among the scheduled speakers. Before dawn Wednesday, a bomb exploded at the home of a member of the Indian chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, causing damage but no injuries. Police said the explosion wrecked a door and several windows at the home of <LOCATION> Ahomed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lambat </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alberton </LOCATION>, southeast of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. There was no claim of responsibility. Anti-apartheid militants are urging a boycott of the Sept. 6 elections for the mixed-race and Indian chambers of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which is dominated by a whites-only chamber and excludes the black majority.

Yet both served humanity with an identically relentless love. Today, a national holiday enshrines the transfiguring legacy of the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>.

We are a nation that thrives on the empty grandeur of symbols. It is far more convenient to erect a graven image to the prophet than to adopt his philosophy. After King died, we named streets, buildings and schools after him. Twenty-one years later, those schools are more likely to be completely segregated. Like King, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> believed one should live his religious convictions. Like King, he suffered an untimely death while searching for peace. Unlike many of his colleagues, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> did not believe in traveling abroad on junkets camouflaged as `` legislative oversight missions,'' ... to luxuriate in the world's best hotels and savor the food at its most elegant restaurants. ...

 Aug. 26 Daily Register, <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, on tranquilizing bears: The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of Game and Fish encountered harsh criticism from animal rights advocates and the public in general ... after an incident in which a bear, tranquilized after climbing a utility pole, came in contact with live wires and fell to the ground. And well it should. The agency, whose primary purpose is to maintain guidelines to ensure the survival of fish and game _ including bear _ did not seem to consider this when tranquilizing the bear, which had climbed the pole after wandering into a town in search of its cub. After the bear climbed up the pole, the agency's first step should have been to cut electrical power. Next, it should have prepared for the bear's fall _ in the form of a safety net _ if the bear fell after being shot with the tranquilizer gun. Instead, the state agency did neither. The result was a 25-foot fall and contact -LRB- with -RRB- transformer coils _ in the form of 7,200 volts. The bear survived _ thankfully. A game and fish department official, after getting a host of calls criticizing the methods, said the agency was `` only concerned about the safety of residents.'' So much for its mission of ensuring the survival of fish and game.

 She entered federal court nine weeks ago as <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, Hotel Queen, ruler of a multibillion-dollar empire. But the image of a different woman emerged at the trial _ tyrannical, nasty, sharp-tongued, cheap. It's been quite a change for Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, the one-time <LOCATION> Chesterfield </LOCATION> cigarette girl who was used to getting her way _ and, witnesses in her tax evasion trial testified, turning ugly when she did n't. She was convicted Wednesday of evading $ 1.2 million in income taxes by charging personal expenses to her business. No one figured it would lead to fingerprints when Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> _ born <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, daughter of a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> hatmaker _ married billionaire <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> in 1972 and thrust herself into the spotlight. Once a featured guest on `` 60 Minutes,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> spurned interviews during her trial. Portrayed as a regal perfectionist in her ads, she was dumped by her advertising agency this month amid charges of meddling. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 69, is <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>'s second wife; she, too, was married before, to a lawyer she divorced in 1959. The couple had a son, who died in 1982; mention of his death brought her near tears at her trial, the only emotion she's shown in the packed courtroom. Her 80-year-old husband, indicted with her, avoided trial on grounds of mental incompetence. <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> was a successful model who had moved into real estate when she met <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> in 1971. She quickly became a $ 500,000-a-year senior vice president. Within a year, she became Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>. No one questions the couple's devotion. <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> called <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> `` gorgeous one'' and `` pussycat'' in a People magazine interview; <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> bathed the Empire State Building _ one of his real estate holdings _ in red, white and blue light for her birthday in 1976. `` It was less than a necklace,'' <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> said of the $ 100,000 treat. The couple enjoyed an opulent lifestyle: an $ 11 million <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> mansion -LRB- the focus of the tax charges -RRB-, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> duplex, a <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> penthouse. They travel in their private plane; their $ 5 billion real estate empire includes 27 hotels. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> took control of the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> hotels in 1980. Her face adorned ads for the hotels; her persona _ the demanding boss bent on perfection _ became her company's motto. `` Service and appointment fit for royalty _ you _ our guest,'' read one Helmsley Palace ad. `` The only palace in the world where the queen stands guard,'' promised another. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s legal woes prior to her indictment last year were limited to reports about a scam to avoid state sales tax. She was never charged, although it was reported she received immunity for her cooperation. The real Leona-bashing began with her trial. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who rarely agree on anything, concurred on <PERSON> Leona </PERSON>: the mayor dubbed her `` the wicked witch,'' while <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> called her `` a sick woman.'' In opening arguments, her own lawyer labeled her `` a tough bitch;'' in closing, a prosecutor attacked her `` selfishness, greed and sheer arrogance.'' Former employees detailed an abrasive boss who hired and fired on a whim. Defense attorney <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> argued it was proper for the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> to bill their business for expenses at <ORGANIZATION> Dunellen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> because they used the estate for business. The employees who testified, he argued, were motivated by spite. It was one of those employees, housekeeper <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, who provided the most memorable line on Leona: `` We do n't pay taxes,'' she quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> as telling her. `` Only the little people pay taxes.''

 Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> arrived today on a trip designed to foster closer ties and establish the diplomatic credentials of his new adminstration. During his first overseas trip since taking office Aug. 9, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> hopes to use baseball diplomacy and meetings with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and academics to ease trade tensions between <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> was greeted here this morning by <PERSON> Nobuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Shunji </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanai </PERSON>, Japanese consul general in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; and several local officials. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, 58, is not expected to propose any major trade or diplomatic initiatives in his talks Friday with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But he hopes to `` establish a close and credible working relationship with the president and other American leaders,'' said <PERSON> Yukio </PERSON> <PERSON> Okamoto </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> also will use the 12-day tour, which will take him to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on Sept. 4-6 and to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> Sept. 7, to enhance his stature at home, analysts say. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, who has little diplomatic experience but is considered an excellent speaker, will address scholars and journalists in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where he plans to watch a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> baseball game from the owner's box. `` Mr. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> wants to initiate a much more increased level of intellectual dialogue with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and especially with its people,'' <PERSON> Okamoto </PERSON> said. In their meeting, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are expected to talk about so-called structural problems that impede an improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which totaled $ 55 billion in 1988, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figures. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> is expected to explain <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s efforts to reduce the trade imbalance, and express its willingness to focus on issues like its complex distribution system and business practices that Americans say block foreign access to the Japanese market. But the prime minister also will emphasize the need for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to address problems such as its large budget deficit and low investment rate, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials say. U.S.-Japanese talks on such non-tariff trade barriers are scheduled to begin Sept. 4, but <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is under strong pressure at home not to make additional concessions on trade. Recent election losses suffered by the party were attributed in part to the unhappiness of farmers over Japanese concessions on agricultural trade. `` It will take a long time to solve the trade imbalance and in the meantime we have to live with it,'' a ministry official said. `` To defuse the tension caused by the imbalance, we need a more objective understanding of each other.'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> also will reassure <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s political and diplomatic stability, ministry officials said Some Japanese foreign policy initiatives have been stalled in recent months as the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> grappled with a series of money and sex scandals and an election setback that led to the resignation of <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s two predecessors.

 Two white teen-agers were indicted today on murder charges in the killing of a black youth last week that has set off a racial furor in the city. The indictments were returned in <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> just one hour before the funeral of <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, 16. A crowd of about 300 people heckled Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> as they arrived for the service. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> had been jeered when he attended a wake for Hawkins Tuesday. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON>, 18, and <PERSON> Pasquale </PERSON> <PERSON> Raucci </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, were charged with murder, riot, assault, criminal possession of a deadly weapon, unlawful imprisonment and civil rights violations. <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> was the alleged leader of a gang of up to 30 whites, armed with baseball bats and golf clubs, that allegedly attacked <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> and three friends Aug. 23 in the predominantly white <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> neighborhood. `` We're surrounded by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON>. We're surrounded by <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpurs </PERSON>. We're surrounded by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> civil rights activist, to start the service at <ORGANIZATION> Glover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. `` They all speak to us and say, ` No more.''' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> are <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> is the black man who was killed when a gang of whites chased him onto a highway in <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpurs </PERSON> was a black woman killed when police tried to evict her from her apartment. Among those at the crowded memorial service were the Rev. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandiford </PERSON>, who had also been attacked in the 1986 <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> incident. He accompanied <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> `` Go home!'' the crowd chanted at <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, while the mayor and Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> were booed. Mayoral candidates <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> were also at the funeral. The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was among 1,600 people who attended a wake Tuesday for <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>. `` This is nothing more than a political indictment,'' charged <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, after his client was charged. `` They know he was n't the shooter. How can they obtain a murder indictment? It's absurd.'' Police are looking for <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fama </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, who has been identified as the gunman in the killing. Judge <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerschwer </PERSON> allowed <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> to remain free on $ 100,000 bail and <PERSON> Raucci </PERSON> on $ 75,000 bail. The grand jury that indicted the two was still considering charges against the other suspects in the case. The night of the attack, <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> and three black friends went to the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> to look at a used car for sale. A group of 10 to 30 whites, armed with at least one gun, bats and golf clubs, chased the four and surrounded them. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> was shot twice in the chest. Six young white men have been charged with assault, riot and other counts. Five have been released on bail. One of the six, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, 20, was arraigned Tuesday and held on $ 75,000 bail. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Neier </PERSON> told the judge that witnesses had placed <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> at the scene with a bat and a pistol. There have been reports that <PERSON> Fama </PERSON> may have fled to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, where his parents were born. Police have asked the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to help find him, Sgt. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has begun a preliminary inquiry into <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' death, said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Driscoll </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office also has offered assistance to the office of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON>, which is handling the case. Such steps are not unusual in cases that may involve federal civil rights violations, <PERSON> Driscoll </PERSON> said. Police said <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> and his friends were innocent victims of a feud between the white gang and 18-year-old <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> Feliciano </PERSON>. She had been dating a Hispanic man and invited black friends into the mostly white neighborhood. One of those arrested was a former boyfriend who had been spurned by Ms. <PERSON> Feliciano </PERSON>, police said. Political, religious and community leaders continued to call for greater efforts to root out racism. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, in a statement, called on New Yorkers to pray `` that we will make this moment of shame a time for honesty and renewal.'' Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said, `` We like to pretend that racial relations are n't broken. Well, they are broken. They're bleeding.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> Bishop <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugavero </PERSON> and state Human Rights Commissioner <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> joined leaders from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italo-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION> in warning against condemning the entire <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> community. `` These people are good, the majority,'' said <PERSON> Mugavero </PERSON>, who described the Italian-Jewish neighborhood as `` a community that really has very deep basic values.''

<HEAD>Doctors Drop Surgery Because East German Leader Too Ill, Sources
Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> underwent gall bladder surgery but doctors had to halt the operation because of the condition of the organ had deteriorated, West German security sources said Wednesday. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> denied the reports about <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, 77. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he was `` progressing toward recovery.'' <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was reported to have undergone a gall bladder operation two weeks ago. The East German government said on Aug. 24 he was `` continuing on the road to recovery.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Hessicher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio on Wednesday said the West German government has received intelligence information indicating <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s condition is more serious than official East German reports suggest. Government security sources confirmed the radio report, but would provide few details. According to the sources, <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s surgeons were forced to abandon the gall bladder operation `` because of the condition of the tissue.'' The information was relayed to the West German government by the country's intelligence service, the sources said. There were no further details. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also speculated whether <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s illness may be one reason the East German government has not yet taken decisive steps to deal with an exodus of refugees out of the Communist country. At least 6,000 East Germans have fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> began dismantling its border barriers in May. Scores more are holed up in West German missions and embassies in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, demanding they be allowed to emigrate. The situation has created tensions between the two Germanies, as well as between <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is among East bloc nations experimenting with liberal reforms while <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> remains a hard-line Communist state. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, spokesman for West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, said there has been `` zero movement'' by the East German government on the refugee problem. `` But I do not know if this has any connection with Mr. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s condition,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s offer still stands to talk with <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> about the refugee problem. `` But there is a question about whether Mr. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> would be able to do that,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. Other high-ranking East German officials also are ailing, say sources in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Premier <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON> has a stomach ailment and has not appeared in public for some time and <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON>, who is responsible for economic affairs, has been suffering from acute leg pains, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON> is 75 and <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> is 62. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has not been seen in public since his operation. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohlhoff </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> government, said Mayor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Momper </PERSON> had hoped to meet with <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> at the Leipzig trade fair on Sunday but that city officials have learned the East German leader will not be there. Sources in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> also would not be at the fair. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s leadership attaches enormous prestige to the <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> trade fair and <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> traditionally opens the biannual international event. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has been hospitalized twice this summer. Illness forced him to leave a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact summit in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> on July 8 before its conclusion, and the official East German media later announced he was in a hospital for problems related to gallstones. He has ruled the country of 16.6 million people since 1971. He supervised the building of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall 10 years earlier. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has strongly shunned the adoption of Kremlin-style political reforms, a factor in the recent surge of refugees from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 On the theory that no one knows scandal like someone who has been caught in one, organizers have signed up participants in some historic instances of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> waywardness to address an ethics seminar. Figures of scandals past and present _ from the delinquency of Watergate to the unseemliness at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> _ will address about 200 career government officials who will pay fees of $ 345 to $ 445 to attend the sessions on `` Scandals, Scoundrels & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION>.'' The Nov. 1 and 2 event is the fifth annual running of the <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s annual course on the straight and narrow. The association represents 2,500 career government executives and managers. Among those taking part is Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of a subcommittee handling ethics issues He agreed to appear before getting caught up last week in an uproar over his own behavior. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, an acknowledged homosexual, asked the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee on Monday to investigate his relationship with a male prostitute whom he had hired to do household chores, then fired after suspecting that the man was selling sex from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s apartment on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. House rules require members to act `` at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House.'' From another scandal front comes <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>, retired inspector general of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, who says he could n't arrest congressional interest in his reports of questionable behavior at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. His topic: `` The Flesh Is Willing ...'' `` But the Spirit Is Weak'' is <PERSON> Elsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s topic. A former assistant secretary of commerce, she's director of the Project on Development of Moral Character at Work. <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Staurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Magruder </PERSON>, a former aide to President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> who became a minister in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, after getting caught up in the Watergate affair, will discuss `` Life After a Scandal.'' That's <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauman </PERSON>'s topic, too. He was a Republican congressman from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> who was defeated after disclosures about his life as a homosexual. No one from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has agreed yet to speak, said association spokesman <PERSON> Gini </PERSON> <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON>, but President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ethics czar, White House counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, has been invited. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> got caught in an ethics wringer himself in February and had to resign as chairman of a multimillion dollar broadcasting company to avoid an appearance of a conflict of interest. For an evening's entertainment, seminar participants will be able to take a two-hour bus `` Scandals Tour of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' which carries intrigued tourists to such places as the Watergate; the <LOCATION> Tidal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, where an inebriated <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> saw his congressional career sink when his lady friend, stripper <PERSON> Fanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Foxe </PERSON>, took a plunge; and the <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> townhouse where <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> entertained model <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and doomed his 1988 Democratic presidential hopes.

 A twice-convicted counterfeiter who forged a hospital pass and walked away from a court-ordered residence program was back in custody Wednesday, authorities said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> `` Pop'' <PERSON> Kerns </PERSON>, 67, who has spent about 30 of the past 50 years in jail, was arrested on a tip Tuesday at an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> campsite. After his arrest July 19 on counterfeiting charges, <PERSON> Kerns </PERSON> was placed in a pre-trial custody program at the Volunteers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Despite <PERSON> Kerns </PERSON>' age and poor health, a federal magistrate rejected prosecutors' requests to put him in jail. Officials were more confident of keeping <PERSON> Kerns </PERSON> behind bars this time. He was being held in the <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> for a hearing later Wednesday. `` I would suspect the court would be highly receptive,'' said Chief <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tingle </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're not real pleased when people take advantage of them and their generosity.'' <PERSON> Kerns </PERSON>, with at least 45 arrests since 1939, had been arrested in July after <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents caught him making counterfeit $ 100 bills on a printing press, officials said. He walked away from the custody program Aug. 22 after forging a counselor's signature on a pass to <ORGANIZATION> Wishard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, authorities said.

 Reports of ties between Israelis and Colombian drug lords are overblown and only one or two companies may have violated the law, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, on a visit to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, also said there were few if any Israeli mercenaries. He and other officials sought to stem the scandal about allegations that former army officers gave paramilitary training to assassination squads for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media said the issue also had divided government officials and could affect lucrative arms exports to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Police questioned two more employee of Hod Hahanit, or Spearhead, a security and arms trading company said to have provided training for the cartel. <PERSON> Yair </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a reserve lieutenant colonel who heads the company, confirmed Wednesday an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official told him to leave <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> because he might be arrested _ raising the possibility the government knew more of his dealings than it has acknowledged. Parliament's law committee rejected a proposal that laws controlling the export of arms and military expertise be strengthened to allow prosecution of Israelis for offenses committed abroad. Some lawmakers said even discussing the matter could influence the current police investigation. Legislator <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Shinui </ORGANIZATION> party said the government was moving too slowly. `` What bothers me is that, for a very long time, these things have been known,'' he said. `` In my opinion, there is no room for Israelis to be military advisers to unsavory types.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told journalists: `` I believe the media, especially in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, are making unjustified statements based on rumors rather than on solid information.'' He said the government was investigating and would punish any former officers who broke Israeli law. `` We are not trying to hide, to conceal,'' the defense minister said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s controls on exports of military equipment and knowledge are the most stringent in the world and companies must have <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> permits for overseas deals, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. `` I believe basically the number of people who have not obeyed the law ... is very, very limited,'' he said. `` One or two Israeli companies either worked without permission or went beyond the permission. Allow me also to stress the point that Israeli mercenaries are basically non-existent.'' News reports from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> said five Israelis were among foreigners involved in training killers for the drug cartels. A report in <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> papter, said defense officials ignored advice by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> two years ago not to issue permits for deals with private groups in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> because the country was unstable. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamishmar </PERSON>, another daily, said <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> was angered by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s expression of doubt, after <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> ordered an investigation, that any <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officers had behaved improperly. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the allegations were raising questions in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> about whether to order more Kfir jet fighters from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Arms exports usually are secret in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> had bought more than $ 350 million worth of aircraft, guns and other military hardware from this country in the past several years.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday condemned <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s shelling of a tanker carrying badly needed fuel supplies to the besieged capital of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deeply deplores the Syrian attack on the fuel transport ship, Sunshield, off the coast of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, with apparent loss of life among the crew,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>. `` This incident points out the immediate need for all sides to accept the cease-fire, lift the blockades, and allow a process of political dialogue to begin under <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> auspices,'' she said. The Maltese-flagged tanker was hit and set on fire Tuesday as it tried to run the Syrian blockade along <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Christian enclave. Seven crewmen were killed and two were wounded. Police said two were missing and believed dead. Nearly six months of fighting between <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its Moslem allies and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian forces have left at least 803 killed and 2,287 wounded.

<HEAD>Leader Calls for Higher Living Standard at No Spiritual Cost</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new spiritual leader, urged the government Wednesday to raise living standards without sacrificing emphasis on spiritual goals, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported. It quoted <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> as telling President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and his new Cabinet: `` People must n't think that. ... untangling the practical problems in the nation's life ... means moving away from the revolution's spirituality and its Islamic goals.'' <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s `` enemies'' want Iranians to believe that, if those who govern `` want to solve the problems of the people.. increase production in the country ... then probably this means forgetting, weakening or discoloring the goals of the revolution and the spiritual.'' On Tuesday, the parliament approved all 22 ministers chosen by <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, despite speculation that some technocrats would be rejected by those who wanted a more radical government. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> seeks to revive the economy and attract foreign capital to rebuild after the eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Approval of the entire Cabinet showed the parliament `` understands well the realities of the country, understands the issues and knows itself to be responsible in context of these realities and this nation,'' said <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, who was chosen as spiritual leader after <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died June 3. Missing from <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s government are such hard-liners as former Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, who is thought to have links with groups holding foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyshahri </PERSON>, the former intelligence minister and a strong opponent of restorig ties with the West. The main opposition group, the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> will have to continue purging radical elements to keep his program on track. Iranian newspapers repeated <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>'s call for economic development. `` Today is the beginning of a nationwide effort to construct and rebuild the country in a manner suitable for an Islamic society,'' said an editorial in the radical, Farsi-language <ORGANIZATION> Abrar </ORGANIZATION> daily carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. During the three-day Cabinet debate, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> rebuffed claims that his ministers lacked political experience. He said they `` have the necessary political credentials, but this time the emphasis has been to ensure that they are also functional.'' `` Right now we have to put more effort into ensuring that the programs passed by parliament are implemented,'' he said.

<HEAD>European Swine Disease Shows Up in Iowa</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An infectious swine disease previously found only in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has been confirmed in stillborn and weak baby pigs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The disease is a type of leptospirosis, which is caused by corkscrew-shaped bacteria called leptospires. About 180 types of leptospires cause disease in livestock, said <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolin </PERSON>, veterinary medical officer with <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bolin </PERSON> said in a report released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the disease, caused by an organism called bratislava, was found in an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> herd. The name resulted after the bacterium was first isolated in 1953 from a hedgehog in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Leptospirosis is transmitted primarily by infected urine, but the leptospires also can pass through the pregnant female's placenta to the fetus. Another probable cause of infection is thought to be venereal transmission from infected boars. Humans in contact with infected animals or urine can develop leptospirosis, the report said. <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> is being studied as a possible contributor to a `` mystery'' syndrome that began causing stillbirths, abortions and deaths of nursing baby pigs about a year ago in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The study was undertaken five months ago at the agency's animal disease center in Ames under a `` technology transfer'' agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bolin </PERSON> said the next step is to inoculate pregnant sows with bratislava to `` establish absolute proof'' that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> version causes reproductive disease. Also, laboratory tests need to be conducted to determine the effectiveness of vaccines in pregnant sows. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> is marketing two vaccines under conditional <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> licenses and is applying for permanent licencing, she said. A company scientist, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON>, said vaccination with the conditionally licensed vaccine protects the animal against `` clinical signs caused by bratislava'' through one pregnancy. He recommended vaccination prior to each breeding. Leptospirosis in both animals and humans can be mild or severe, and is often misdiagnosed, the agency said. The disease in humans has been confused with influenza, hepatitis, yellow fever, pneumonia, polio, meningitis and encephalitis.

<HEAD>Cholera Breaks Out in Squalid Refugee Camp</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Cholera has broken out at a camp housing 4,500 Vietnamese refugees who suffer from poor sanitary conditions and lack of water, a health official said Wednesday. The first case of the disease was discovered Sunday, the same day food riots hit the camp. Dr. Lo Wai-kee, principal medical officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Vietnamese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the government agency had confirmed that a 4-year-old Vietnamese boy and two women had contracted the gastrointestinal disease. He said all three, who are from different families, are in satisfactory condition. Lo said he was not surprised at the cholera outbreak at Tai A Chau, an outlying island, because of the poor health conditions there. `` The environment is not satisfactory. The potential risks are there,'' he said. He said there was insufficent water for washing, and the Vietnamese had to bathe in the sea. Garbage collection is poor, and there are no indoor bathrooms, he said. Lo said at least one of the victims had eaten improperly cooked seafood and may have caught the disease as a result. He said it was unlikely the disease was transmitted through government dry rations. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee officials have said Vietnamese refugees in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s screening centers were in danger of dying because of malnutrition and disease. Lo said there was no such danger on Tai A Chau, but he acknowledged that common disease on the island include pink-eye, skin illness and enterogastritis. A medical team went to the island Wednesday and distributed drugs to the Vietnamese as a preventive measure, and the government has imposed a quarantine on the camp, he said. Lo said the restriction could be lifted in 10 days if no new cases were reported. Sunday's rioting broke out during rice distribution when about 1,000 Vietnamese started throwing stones at police. Authorities fired tear gas to disperse the stone-throwers but withdrew that night for fear of further violence. Police reoccupied Tai A Chau on Monday with helicopters and landing vessels. They found the police station, health center and public facilities destroyed and received several rape and robbery reports. By then, about 1,000 boat people had swum to a barge off the island to escape further attack. They were later moved to <PERSON> Shek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwu </PERSON> <PERSON> Chau </PERSON>, another nearby island. The government has also placed a quarantine on that island because of the cholera outbreak on Tai A Chau. On Tuesday, 13 Vietnamese were arrested on charges of rape, robbery and assault during the Sunday rioting. About 55,000 Vietnamese are staying in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, waiting for repatriation or resettlement. The government began to put newly arriving boat people on <LOCATION> Tai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> A </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chau </LOCATION> in June in an emergency measure to cope with their increasing numbers. Refugees usually stay there for about two weeks before they are inoculated and moved to other detention centers. The three cholera victims had been on the island for a month.

The stage was flanked by a huge American flag of red, white and blue balloons. The president was presented with a painting of <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point as it appeared in 1906. The day also included an afternoon jog before <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s arrival. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> share `` a close similarity of views ... on world affairs and a kind of unique personal closeness and frankness in exchanging views,'' Scowcroft He said U.S.-Canada relations are `` in basically pretty good shape,'' after the sweeping Free Trade Agreement signed last year by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, and efforts by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to deal with acid rain pollution through his proposed Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act would sharply curb emissions from utility plants and other industrial souces of airborne acid rain that causes pollution in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Scowcroft said the two also would discuss assassinations by drug barons in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and attempts by President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> to crack down on traffickers. In his remarks at the Chamber presentation, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was applauded when he asked the local businessmen to support his push for a cut in the capital gains tax for businesses when he returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. That, he said, `` stimulates the economy. It encourages risk-taking.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made light of press reports noting that he has yet to catch any fish despite daily fishing excursions on his speedboat, <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>, and called the reports `` a vicious assault on my ability.'' He also denied reports that he had run over a lobster pot or a rock with his boat. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> inspector took a look at the site and `` started to tell me that he thought maybe accidently I had hit a rock.'' The president, noting he has piloted boats there his entire life, told the man: `` Find some other answer. Even if there is metal on the rock out there, I did not hit that rock.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> man, hearing the words of his commander in chief, `` changed his mind as I was talking to him and _ we now think it was a submerged board,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 The bells of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catherine </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> carillon in this port city pealed Wednesday for the first time since the end of World War II, a symbol of peace and reconciliation 50 years after the conflict began. The bells, a gift from the West German people to the residents of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, were dedicated at a Mass celebrated by Bishop <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Goclowski </PERSON>. Joining in readings during the service, for the intention of the war's victims, was a German Evangelical minister. Afterward, <PERSON> Goclowski </PERSON> consecrated the bells with holy water and the 1,000-member crowd of Poles and Germans listened to a computer-directed carillon concert of works of <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>. The first melody played by the rededicated carillon was part of <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s Ninth Symphony. Friday is the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II. The first shots were fired in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on the morning of Sept. 1, 1939. Thirty-seven bells weighing more than 16 tons make up the carillon, which replaces a set of bells that was lost during the war, when the former Free City of <PERSON> Danzig </PERSON> was incorporated into the Third Reich. At the end of the war, the city was largely destroyed, subjected to Allied bombing raids, Soviet artillery and house-to-house fighting during the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s advance on the city in March 1945. The German population fled or was expelled after the war and <PERSON> Danzig </PERSON> became the Polish city of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, causing anger among some Germans toward Poles. But the theme of the rededication ceremony stressed reconciliation between the nations. A former <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> resident, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggegrecht </PERSON>, headed the drive to replace the bells after noticing the destroyed bell tower during a trip to his native city five years ago. He organized a society in his new home of <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION> and even traveled to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to obtain Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s spiritual blessing for the project. The fund accumulated about $ 150,000 for the project, with contributors including West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and West German President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>. The new bells were cast at the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Asten </LOCATION> and shipped to <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressman said Wednesday that objections of Filipino senators to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases here could prompt <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to reduce its military commitment to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. He spoke the same day that activists mounted two small protests at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy about the bases. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>, D-Pa., was referring to a resolution signed Thursday by 12 of 23 Filipino senators who called for closing the bases when their lease expires in 1991 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> officials are expected to begin talks this year on extending the lease. But any agreement must be approved by two-thirds of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution suggests President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> would lack votes for ratification. `` Obviously, it ca n't be ratified if they stick to what they say,'' said <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>. `` I have no idea whether they mean what they say. But I know it does n't help the political situation and climate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> when we see distinguished members of their <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> making statements about the treaty.'' About 40,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, civilian employees and military dependents are stationed at six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installations, which include <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and the Subic Bay Naval Base. They are among the largest outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>, who serves as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> defense appropriations subcommittee, told an American business group that maintaining current force levels in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> `` is not a top priority of the American <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said statements against the bases `` could inflame members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' eager to find ways of reducing American troop strength overseas. However, at a later news conference, <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON> said he believes the bases are vital to the defense of the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and contribute economically to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. About 70,000 Filipinos work at the installations, collecting more than $ 96 million in annual salaries. Filipino critics claim the bases infringe on national sovereignty. During the protests Wednesday, about 100 leftist students unfurled anti-bases banners at the Department of Foreign Affairs. A group of militant feminists mounted a separate protest against the bases in front of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. No violence was reported in either protest. In October, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to provide $ 481 million a year to keep the bases until 1991, but many Filipino politicians believe <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> should pay more. No date has been set for talks on a new agreement. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is expected to discuss the timetable when he visits the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> next month. <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON> was part of a congressional delegation that included Reps. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-La </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>

 A passenger train that switched to the wrong track collided head-on with another train Wednesday, killing one person and injuring at least 27 others, a railway official said. Three cars derailed when the two trains crashed while traveling at a low rate of speed between <LOCATION> Voralberg </LOCATION> province's capital of <LOCATION> Bregenz </LOCATION> and the small town of <LOCATION> Wolfurt </LOCATION>, the railway official said. Killed was <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Rescuers found his body in the wreckage about two hours after the crash. Sixteen people, including both train drivers, were hospitalized, and 11 other people were treated for minor injuries, the rail official said. The injured included Austrian, West German and Swiss passengers, as well as two Japanese, the official said. He said human error was probably to blame for the accident because one of the trains, an express traveling from <LOCATION> Bregenz </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, was switched onto the same track as the other train. There were 72 passengers on the <LOCATION> Bregenz-Vienna </LOCATION> train and 75 on the other train, an express from <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. The crash occurred very close to the site of a train accident a year earlier in which five people were killed and 46 injured.

<TEXT>
 Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a conservationist who pioneered the effort to save the world's rain forests and helped launch the World Wildlife Fund, is dead at age 79. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a World War II naval hero and an Olympic yachtsman, died Tuesday in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Southmead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> following a heart attack earlier in the day while visiting the western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> city. He would have been 80 on Sept. 14. He was known internationally for his campaigns to save birds, bears, tigers and whales. In his last years he was forced to defend his father, Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcon </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, against revisionist historians who claimed the great polar explorer bungled the 1911-12 expedition in which he and four companions perished of cold and hunger. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s death was announced Wednesday by the Wildlife and Wetlands Trust, which he began in 1946 at <LOCATION> Slimbridge </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Severn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> estuary where he lived. He founded it as a haven for water birds after shooting a goose and seeing it die slowly. `` I thought I would n't do that to my worst enemy so why should I do it to a goose,'' he recalled. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> was a co-founder in 1961 of the Swiss-based World Wildlife Fund, now the World Wide Fund for Nature. He designed its panda logo and helped raise more than $ 60 million for 6,000 conservation projects in 135 countries. The fund is largely credited with saving the Indian tiger and the polar bear and with pioneering efforts to save rain forests. Buckingham Palace said <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, her husband, Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, and their son, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, sent condolences to <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Philippa </PERSON> Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Attenborough </PERSON>, the TV naturalist, described <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> as the `` patron saint of conservation _ one of the great figures who warned the world of what was happening and not only warned but did something about it.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> was 2 when his father died in March 1912 in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> snows after being beaten to the South Pole by the Norwegian, <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Amundsen </PERSON>. The explorer left a note to his wife saying, `` Make the boy interested in natural history; it is better than games.'' His son said he felt having a hero for a father meant he had to do well in different fields. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> became a celebrated bird artist, won an Olympic yachting bronze medal in 1936, was a thrice-decorated naval commander in World War II, a champion glider pilot, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup helmsman in 1964 and the first Briton to be knighted for services to conservation, in 1973. He wrote or illustrated nearly 40 books and an autobiography, `` The Eye of the Wind'' in 1961. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> was prominent in whale-saving efforts and said in 1987: `` If the pressure is kept up, all commercial whaling should cease and the only whales killed would be for subsistence by people like the Eskimos who take small numbers, and I think they should be allowed to go on doing so.'' He led expeditions of explorers and naturalists to many parts of the world, including three in his father's footsteps to the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>, which he called the last environmental frontier. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> believed in the <ORGANIZATION> Loch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monster </ORGANIZATION>, saying it was a family of prehistoric creatures living in the Scottish lake. He gave the animal a scientific name, Nessiteras rhombopteryx, meaning <PERSON> Ness </PERSON> monster with diamond fin. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and his family expressed anger in 1985 over a TV serial, `` The Last Place on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' based on a debunking book by <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Huntford </PERSON> called `` Scott and <PERSON> Amundsen </PERSON>.'' It depicted his father as an incompetent loser and alleged that Capt. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON>, had an affair with another Norwegian explorer, <PERSON> Fridtjof </PERSON> <PERSON> Nansen </PERSON>, while her husband was battling in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>. `` They were very friendly but I do n't believe for an instant that she had an affair with him,'' Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> is survived by his two wives and three children. In 1942, he married the novelist <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, by whom he had a daughter. The marriage was dissolved in 1951 and the same year he married his secretary, <PERSON> Philippa </PERSON> <PERSON> Talbot-Ponsonby </PERSON>, who bore him a son and a daughter.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration blamed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> on Wednesday for the collapse of a 19-nation peace conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and reiterated its reluctant support for a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> role in a transitional government. The conference, launched in late July in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and other foreign ministers, is dissolving in disagreement over how to end the conflict between rival warring actions. The collapse could result in stepped-up fighting between government forces and an anti-communist resistance that includes exiled Cambodian leader Prince <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> elements. When <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to kick off the conference, there already was recognition that a difficult compromise had to be struck to end the civil war and that the deliberations could take months. But there was guarded optimism the blood-letting might be ended with diplomacy. Cambodian Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, who hopes to retain power after the scheduled withdrawal of 26,000 Vietnamese troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> a month from now, strenuously objected to any role for the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, who were ousted in an invasion by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1978 and still have <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s support. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, under then-leader <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, is believed responsible for the massacre of at least 1 million Cambodians from 1975 to 1978. Speaking in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, registered unalterable <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> returning to power. She called it a `` murderous group.'' However, she said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue to support <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> if he believed that <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> elements, along with members of the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government, `` should have an interim role.'' Asked why the conference had collapsed, she said `` it was not possible to achieve a lasting settlement due to the failure of the Vietnamese and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> regime to negotiate constructively on key issues.'' At the same time, the spokeswoman said `` progress was made toward the important goal of a free and independent Cambodia.'' `` Any progress is welcome and we should build upon it.''

 The Israeli army is creating a special unit to help put down the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories after experimenting with soldiers specially trained in riot control, an army spokesman said Wednesday. The move marks a break with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military tradition in which troops are trained mainly as combat soldiers for conventional warfare. The new special force is intended to get regular combat troops out of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and back to standard training programs, said Col. <PERSON> Renaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, the army's deputy chief spokesman. <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said two experimental special companies have been operating in the occupied territories for several months. Their formation followed complaints by some officers that duty in the territories was cutting into regular training. The decision to form a permanent new unit was made after the experimental companies proved effective in dealing with Palestinians who have been waging an uprising against Israeli rule in lands occupied in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said. At least 19 Palestinians and two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were injured Wednesday in new clashes in the occupied territories. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> town of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, two soldiers were injured by stones and 11 Palestinians were shot and wounded when troops opened fire during a stone-throwing melee, the army and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Six Palestinians were shot and wounded in three other clashes in the seaside strip. An army spokesman confirmed two Arabs wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and said the military was investigating other reports. At least 554 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with soldiers or Israeli civilians during the uprising. Thirty-eight Israeli also have been slain. `` These units will spend most of their service in one place,'' <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said, adding `` they will know the area and the population better than troops that rotate in and out every three or four months.'' The special unit, dubbed the `` territories companies,'' will receive specialized training on how to deal with stone - and firebomb-throwing youths attacking troops in cities and villages, <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said He said they would operate better in such situations than elite infantry units, trained to fight regular forces on a battlefield or guerrillas attempting to infiltrate into the country. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Al-Hamishmar </ORGANIZATION> reported that new recruits are reluctant to be sent to the experimental forces, which did more police duties than the more glamorous combat units. But <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> denied the report. `` We have had no problem in recruiting men and do not expect any when we enlarge the unit,'' he said. All Israeli men do three years of compulsory military duty and serve in the reserves for up to 60 days a year until the age of 54, often in the occupied territories. Most women serve for two years in non-combat units and later in the reserves until the age of 24. <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said the possibility of hurting soldiers' morale by having them spend the majority of their three-year military service among hostile civilians had been thoroughly examined by military psychologists. `` Of course we examined the issue and we are confident the soldiers will be OK,'' he said.

 The nation's schools are being attacked by `` self-appointed censors'' who want to ban or restrict profane or satanic books and sanitize sex education classes, an anti-censorship group said Wednesday. People For the American Way released its 7th annual report, `` Attacks on the Freedom to Learn,'' that claimed censorship and other ideological attacks on public education by religious extremists and members of right-wing organizations occurred in 42 of the 50 states. The report singled out 172 incidents that it said occurred during the 1988-89 school year, comparing them with the 157 the group reported in 1987-88. `` I want to emphasize that what is at stake in the battles being fought in communities across the nation is more than just the fate of a few novels or a textbook or two,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, chairman of the group founded by television producer <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>. `` We are witnessing in these skirmishes the clash of two competing views of public education in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The censors see efforts to teach our children about the world around them as a threat; the rest of us see it as a way to broaden our children's vistas and opportunities. Sex education remains a major target by what the group described as the far right, which `` already scored some damaging victories'' during the last school year, the report said. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, for example, the report cited statewide restrictions that forced school textbook publishers to delete information on the use of condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS. `` There is a growing ultra-conservative movement to restrict the availability of information in the school about such topics as contraception, abortion and AIDS,'' said President <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON>, who predicted that `` attacks on sex education are likely to increase'' with recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings on reproductive rights. The report said school libraries were the target of significantly more censorship attempts during the 1988-89 school year, accounting for nearly half the challenges nationwide. It said that most of the attacks it had investigated resulted in either removal of the material or in restrictions on its use, such as requiring parental consent. `` We are finding more and more instances in which self-appointed censors focus not just on material in the curriculum but on materials available in school libraries,'' said <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON>. `` Not content with sanitizing classroom teaching, they want to scour the library shelvs of any materials of which they disapprove.'' The main targets of such challenges were literary classics such as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s `` Of Mice and Men'' and <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON>'s `` The Catcher in the Rye,'' as well as plays by <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aristophanes </PERSON>, the report said. The most frequent objections, the report said, were to materials seen as containing `` offensive language'' and those perceived as touching on `` satanism, witchcraft and the occult.'' Challenges to satanism has grown over the last two years, said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hulsizer </PERSON>, author of the report. No challenges were reported in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakato </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the report said. It said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> led the nation with what it called 23 censorship attempts.

 Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic reforms wo n't be abandoned, but official media Wednesday attacked a former leader who helped foster those reforms. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, in a speech seen Wednesday, said reforms adopted before June will remain in effect and local governments can continue experimenting with other reforms, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. `` Our policies ca n't be changed at will. This helps stabilize people's hearts, stabilize stabilize the economy,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Cabinet. Protests by students demanding more social reforms to the ranks -LRB- and -RRB- match <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s freer economy broke out April 15. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders crushed the pro-democracy movement with a military raid on demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 3-4. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> gave the speech Aug. 15 but it was not published until Tuesday, in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>. The paper was seen in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The release of speeches in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is often delayed. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief who helped carry out <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s liberalized economic reforms, wasn, increase the party's leadership of enterprises in ideological education, -LRB- and -RRB- develop the party's supervisory role.'' The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily commentary accused <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> and his economic adviser <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON> of violating the party constitution by advocating policies that sought to reduce party interference in the economy and to let some market forces rule. `` <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON> and others did their utmost to distort the supervisory function of party organizations in enterprises -LRB- and -RRB- did everything possible to limit and fetter'' them, the paper said. The reforms were beginning to see some success, with lively small and medium-sized business and rural and township enterprises invigorating the economy and making profits, unlike the ponderous, state-owned enterprises. However, their rapid growth also caused economic problems, such as shortages of raw materials and energy. The commentary quoted <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> as saying in a 1986 meeting with provincial governors, `` The big problems and issues in an enterprise need not be discussed by the party committee. Otherwise, it would be hard to put the -LRB- reforms -RRB- into effect. It is necessary to make some some rather large changes to the original regulations.'' <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> has been arrested and some reports say <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> is under house arrest.

 A French envoy held talks with Moslem leaders in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday amid rocket and artillery duels between Syrian and Christian forces across the embattled Lebanese capital. Police said at least three people were killed and 50 wounded in the exchanges. The casualties raised the overall toll to at least 805 killed and 2,318 wounded since March 8, when fighting erupted between army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian units and Syrian forces. The French diplomat, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON>, was accompanied by two carloads of bodyguards on the trip from Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to the Moslem sector across the embattled demarcation line. As he met with <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamseddine </PERSON>, the Shiite Moslems' senior clergyman, five mortar rounds fired from the Christian heartland exploded around the 10-story apartment building in the <LOCATION> Tallet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Khayat </LOCATION> district. The white-turbaned clergyman quickly ushered his guest to the hallway near the elevator shaft for safety and continued their talks for another 15 minutes. East Beirut also was under fire, and the wounded there included two French communications engineers, police said. <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Tuesday and met with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON> in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

After his talks with <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` I'm trying to meet several <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> leaders who are interested in inter-Lebanese dialogue.'' He did not elaborate. The French ruled <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> from 1918 to 1943 and have traditionally been the protectors of the Christians. They have antagonized Moslems by dispatching a naval flotilla to the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> to evecuate French citizens if the crisis worsens. The French peace plan calls for lifting blockades imposed by both sides, a halt to arms deliveries to the warring factions, political reforms that will distribute power equally between Christians and Moslems and the withdrawal of Syrian and Israeli forces from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has about 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They moved in under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate in 1976 and are allied with Moslem forces. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupies a border strip in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, the radio station of the pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON>'s proposals have been `` rejected by the nationalist -LRB- leftist -RRB- forces.'' Moslems fear that if the blockade of the Christian enclave is lifted without inspection of ships, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> will bring in more weapons from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, his main backer and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s archrival in the Arab world. The independent daily <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON> told Moslems that <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has demanded `` international guarantees to stop Syrian arms shipments to the Moslem and leftist militias.'' An <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the general `` does not accept the formation of an inter-Lebanese committee to monitor arms supplies because we have n't been fighting Lebanese factions.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> radio accused `` the Syrians and their allies'' of escalating fighting `` to confuse any effort or mediation to end the sufferings of the Lebanese ...'' The police spokesman said the duels Wednesday escalated at 1:20 a.m. after Syrian gunners shelled Christian-controlled waters north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s coast guard command called off a search for two missing sailors of the Maltese-flag tanker Sunshield, which was hit by Syrian shellfire off the Christian coast on Tuesday. `` The two are presumed dead,'' the police spokesman said. Two wounded <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> sailors of the ship's 11-man crew were rescued Tuesday and the bodies of seven others washed ashore. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` deeply deplores'' the Syrian attack on the ship. `` This incident points out the immediate need for all sides to accept the cease-fire, lift the blockades, and allow a process of political dialogue to begin under <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> auspices,'' she said. Meanwhile, Soviet envoy <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> headed home after a 10-day tour in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, aimed at ending the fighting.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, the `` rich girl'' who for 37 years ran the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> with a liberal editorial stance and a tight rein on finances, died Wednesday of cancer. She was 86. <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, who had been ill since May, died at her home, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Faris </PERSON>, a vice president at the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> bought the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in 1939 at the behest of her husband. She sold it to media magnate <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> in 1976 for a reported $ 31 million. In between, she commanded the fortunes of a newspaper which, in her words, advocated `` honest unionism, social reform and humane government programs.'' Under <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> was a middle-class tabloid known for its features, columns and liberal views. While other <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> newspapers withered and died _ the Journal-American, the World Telegram and Sun, the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, the Mirror _ the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> survived, and eventually became the only afternoon paper in the city. `` Often voted least likely to succeed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s competitive journalistic climate, she outmaneuvered'' and outlasted rivals, <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> once wrote. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, known to many as <PERSON> Dolly </PERSON>, was born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1903. Her grandfather was financier <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, a founder of the <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> banking house and a prominent philanthropist. The young heiress studied at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s exclusive <ORGANIZATION> Brearly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and attended <ORGANIZATION> Bryn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mawr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` I was a rich kid of the right kind _ not the robber baron type _ and had been to the right schools,'' she once observed. As an adult, she was thrifty: `` I do n't know if it's fear of being self-indulgent or a puritanical guilt, but spending just is n't easy for me. In later years, <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>'s tight fist was legendary. The Post always seemed to do more with less _ the smallest staff, the most decrepit equipment. In the early 1930s, <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> got involved in a number of social welfare efforts _ a settlement house for immigrants, several hospitals, a club that provided lunches to women looking for jobs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. By birth, <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> was a Republican. But the Depression, and the response of the administration of <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, led her to change her affiliation. She became a confidante of both the president and <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, and at one point declined <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION>'s invitation to run a program for farm women. In 1939, <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> bought the Post at the request of her husband, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Backer </PERSON>, an appointee to <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> who ran unsuccessfully for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. At first, <PERSON> Backer </PERSON> served as editor and president; she served as director and vice president, and her ownership was not public knowledge. Financial losses led <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> to conclude that the paper needed comic strips, columns, features and a tabloid format. When Backer disagreed, <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> promoted <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Olin </PERSON> <PERSON> Thackrey </PERSON> from feature editor to executive editor. In 1942, <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> became president and publisher. She divorced Backer in 1943 and married Thackrey. `` When I took on the Post, I did n't have much faith in myself or the paper, and I did n't really think I could pull it out. Now, it's part of me _ we are part of each other,'' <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> said in a 1976 biography, `` Men, Money and Magic,'' by <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> Her notion that features would build readership paid off _ the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s magazine-style stories and pages of columns -LRB- at one point in the 1940s, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> had nearly 50 columnists, including <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> herself -RRB- had faithful followers. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> also became known for its sports coverage, although <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> confided later, `` I never read a sports page in my life.'' She and <PERSON> Thackrey </PERSON> differed in print in 1948. Both opposed <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Thackrey </PERSON> supported <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> backed Republican <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>. By 1950, <PERSON> Thackrey </PERSON> was out, both as editor and as <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>'s husband. In the 1950s, under <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wechsler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> became known for investigative reporting. <PERSON> Wechsler </PERSON> eventually relinquished control of the news department and took over the editorial page, and in the 1960s the newspaper's features became softer. After years of profits, the paper's fortunes dimmed in the 1970s as much of its audience moved to the suburbs. Ultimately, <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> sold it to <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>. `` It was a terrible headache,'' she said. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> transformed the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> into a racier, more conservative tabloid before selling it to real estate developer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> in 1988. <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>'s four marriages ended in divorce. Her first husband was <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B.W </PERSON>. Hall, followed by Backer, Thackrey and <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonneborn </PERSON>. She is survived by her two daughters, Adele Hall Sweet and <PERSON> Sarah-Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramarsky </PERSON>, her son <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, 15 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. A private burial was planned.

 A Philippine Constabulary officer was relieved of his command two weeks after he led an assault to free hostages held by inmates in a siege in which 21 people died, the military announced Wednesday. Legislators have criticized the military's handling of the crisis in <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Wilfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, the constabulary spokesman in <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, gave no reason for the transfer of Capt. <PERSON> Poblio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gildo </PERSON> and refused to say if it was connected to the hostage crisis. <PERSON> Gildo </PERSON> led the assault to end a three-day crisis when an Australian missionary and 15 other people were held hostage by 16 prisoners. All the prisoners and five hostages, including the missionary, were killed before troops regained control of the jail, 610 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gildo </PERSON> was reassigned to the regional constabulary headquarters in <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> but was not immediately given specific duties, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gildo </PERSON> was succeeded by his deputy as commander of <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s 431st <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. Australian officials have said the missionary's wounds indicated she may have been slain by government snipers who opened fire during an abortive jailbreak a few hours before the prison was stormed.

<HEAD>Changes Scheduled for Treatment of Lab Animals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some changes in federal regulations affecting the care and handling of laboratory animals will go into effect Oct. 30, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Among the changes will be a requirement that research facilities create special committees to assure humane care and treatment of animals. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the revisions `` will partially implement'' amendments to the federal Animal Welfare Act passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> almost four years ago. The amendments provide new and stricter requirements to protect laboratory animals from undue pain and stress, tighten enforcement of rules already on the books, and revise the list of definitions needed to carry out the law. Current regulations define standards for animal use, including minimum requirements for handling, housing, feeding, watering, sanitation, ventilation, shelter and veterinary care. <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said the revisions will make the rules for dogs, cats and non-human primates, including monkeys, more complete and easier to understand. Besides requiring research facilities to create special animal care committees, the new regulations include provisions for veterinary care, and holding facilities and handling. The Animal Welfare Act covers most businesses that buy or sell warm-blooded animals, exhibit them and transport them commercially. Rats, mice, birds, horses and farm animals are not covered by the regulations. An agency spokeswoman, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Hinnawy </PERSON>, said there are three parts to the package of regulatory changes. The final decisions announced Wednesday affect only the first and second parts. Part One includes a definition of terms used in carrying out the 1985 amendments, she said. Part Two relates to the identification methods, records, licensing requirements and other details. Part Three, which is still under study by the agency, will include details of the actual standards for federal regulation of animal care _ the space each must have, access to food and water, and other details that affect their routines. <PERSON> El-Hinnawy </PERSON> said she did n't know when <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> might decide on final rules for Part Three.

<HEAD>Cracks Confirmed In Three Mile Island's Steel Lining</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A TV camera lowered into the damaged <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> reactor confirmed small cracks in a steel liner, officials said Wednesday. The cracks in the Unit 2 reactor appear to be tears in the thin stainless steel lining inside the 5-inch-thick carbon steel reactor vessel, which contains the radioactive fuel and hot water surrounding it, the plant operator said. Still unanswered is whether the cracks extend from the liner into the reactor vessel. `` There is n't any way to tell definitely, but it's not considered likely,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedell </PERSON>, spokesman for the plant operator, <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The reactor was damaged in 1979 in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear power industry's worst accident. The investigation of the cracks required a newly developed radiation-resistant, high-resolution camera and special tools to brush debris from the area, probe the cracks and take measurements through 40 feet of water. The liner, three-sixteenths of an inch thick, prevents corrosion of the steel below it. High fuel temperatures and the difference in the contraction rates between the two types of steel caused the cracks or tears, <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear said. One crack was 6 inches long, about three-thirty-seconds of an inch wide and about one-sixteenth of an inch deep, <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear said. Three other cracks were from 3 to 5 inches long, the plant operator said. The color pictures taken Saturday revealed a few additional cracks in an area where two lines thought to be cracks were spotted in July, <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear said. Molten uranium fuel as hot as 5,000 degrees flowed to the reactor's bottom during the March 1979 accident that damaged the reactor. A series of operator and mechanical errors cut off cooling water to the radioactive core and about half the fuel rods melted. Radioactive gas was released to the atmosphere. Since the accident, there has been no evidence that the vessel was breached, <PERSON> Bedell </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> TMI </ORGANIZATION>'s Unit 1 reactor was undamaged and remains in service. Under a program sponsored in part by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, samples of the steel will be removed for study by researchers from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The work is expected to take up to 2 -LCB- years.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Political leaders said Wednesday that two coalitions have been formed to field candidates in general elections that may be held next year. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Bazin </PERSON> said he has forged an alliance with two other prominent leaders, center-leftist <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dejean </PERSON> <PERSON> Belizaire </PERSON>, a supporter of Haitian ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril. `` We hope to offer the people a credible coalition, an opportunity to have a government of the people, by the people and for the people,'' said <PERSON> Bazin </PERSON>, a front-runner in the Nov. 29, 1987, elections that were aborted by violence,. <PERSON> Bazin </PERSON> now heads the center-right <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Installation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. His coalition _ the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> _ will present a joint platform and common candidates for general elections, which the independent <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said would not be held before next year. The council is expected to announce next month a calendar for local, legislative and presidential elections. <PERSON> Bazin </PERSON> said most of the platform has been written but refused to disclose its content. He said the coalition is negotiating including other moderate leaders in its ranks. Three other prominent moderate politicians _ <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Philippe-Auguste </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronceray </PERSON>, all leading candidates in the 1987 canceled elections _ met Wednesday to negotiate a coalition of their own. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronceray </PERSON>, head of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Mobilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, said they intended to find a `` common program to run the country.'' They have no formal name for the coalition so far nor have they announced a platform. <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON> said he invited <PERSON> Sylvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Claude </PERSON>, also a major candidate in 1987, to join the coalition. <PERSON> Bazin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Claude </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dejoie </PERSON> and center-leftist <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gourge </PERSON> were the four top contenders in 1987 when thugs protected by soldiers massacred at least 34 voters at polling stations and caused the elections to be canceled. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, who ruled <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> at that time, dissolved the independent <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and said he would hold new elections. The four leading presidential candidates boycotted <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s elections in January 1988, which brought <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> to power Foes of the government said those army-run elections were riddled with fraud. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronceray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philippe-Auguste </PERSON> both agreed to take part in that balloting despite a major boycott by voters. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ousted <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> in June 1988, and was himself ousted the following September in a soldiers' revolt which brought <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> to power. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> pledged a return to democratic rule and encouraged creation of the new <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which was appointed by institutions that included the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, trade unions and human rights groups.

 Armed with evidence showing that 77 percent of the nation's adolescent deaths each year are preventable, doctors and educators joined Wednesday to form a group to attack problems confronting youth. A national commission on adolescent health was formed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The commission was formed, said <PERSON> Roseann </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, president of the education association, `` when we observed that we could not reduce our young people's vulnerability to AIDS, alcohol and drug addiction, heart disease and other preventable illness without changing their behavior.'' `` Hungry, sick, violated, abused, doped up kids can not learn,'' said <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>. `` Research tells us that ` one-shot' education programs do not work, and that comprehensive multi-component programs that change behavior are critical. I can not overemphasize the need for schools, families and communities to work together. ...'' Ms. <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> will serve as commission co-chairman along with Dr. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

Rates for suicide and birth for teens 10 - to 14-years-old have gone up dramatically in recent years Both the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> and education association said national attention and community based efforts should focus on comprehensive school health programs for all grades, kindergarten through 12th, and particularly on programs for the disadvantaged and those involved in risky or life-threatening behaviors.

 Anti-abortion activists Wednesday claimed Republican <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>'s election to succeed late <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> proves that their movement is `` alive and well'' in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s July 3 decision on abortion. Abortion rights supporters, however, said abortion was not a key issue in the race between Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, who had the support of abortion rights activists. During the campaign, Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, 37, a state senator, said she favored more restrictions on abortion and <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> said he favored more choice. However, with polls indicating most voters supported abortion rights, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate said abortion was more of a state legislative issue than a congressional issue. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Faucher </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters the organization made a $ 1,000 contribution to Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> in the Republican primary election and spent about $ 15,000 for activities on her behalf in the general election campaign. `` <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>'s win is a pivotal victory for the pro-life movement,'' Ms. <PERSON> Faucher </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` Clearly, the net pro-life increment is alive and well after the <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> decision.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 5-4 ruling, giving states greater power to limit abortions, appeared on the court's docket as <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> vs. Reproductive Health Services. Ms. <PERSON> Faucher </PERSON> also said that abortion was `` a highly visible issue'' in the Aug. 12 special election in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in which Republican <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON>, an abortion opponent, defeated Democrat <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> for the seat of former Speaker of the House <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. She said anti-abortion candidates also have won six of eight state legislative races since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. Abortion rights leaders have contended that state legislative victories in two races in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> indicated movement in their direction in the wake of the court ruling. Ms. <PERSON> Faucher </PERSON>, however, said anti-abortion candidates have won in races in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> legislative districts. <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, denied that abortion was a major issue in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> congressional races or the legislative contests cited by Ms. <PERSON> Faucher </PERSON>. `` The anti-choice movement is stretching a major point to claim victory on the issue of abortion in that -LRB- <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> -RRB- race,'' she said. `` That was not the issue.'' Republicans hailed <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>'s election as a major victory, noting that Pepper had held the seat for the Democrats since 1962 when the seat was created. Pepper died May 30 at age 88. According to unofficial returns, predominantly Latin precincts had turnouts of more than 60 percent and gave Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, the first Cuban-American elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, 80 percent to 90 percent of the vote. She carried the entire district by a 53 percent to 47 percent margin. Ms. <PERSON> Faucher </PERSON>, however, said `` <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> could not have won the vote with just the Hispanic vote. There is not a majority of Hispanics in the district.'' `` There had to be other issues involved, and we feel that definitely the abortion issue played a major factor in the race,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, however, said, `` Nothing was an issue there that could supersede the ethnicity issue. The fact is that no issue, even the issue of choice, could overwhelm the ethnicity issue.'' Ms. <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON> said the abortion rights group contributed $ 5,000 to <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>'s campaign and spent about $ 2,500 on get-out-the-vote efforts.

 The drug control strategy President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will present next week will call for $ 250 million to $ 260 million in economic and military aid for the three main principal producing countries _ <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> _ an administration source said Wednesday. Earlier, sources had said that aid figure could hit $ 300 million, and national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> indicated Tuesday that the figure would be even higher than that. When asked about the reported $ 300 million figure for the Andean countries, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said, `` That figure, I think you can assume, has already been increased by the fact that we have given <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> $ 65 million'' to help it fight the `` total war'' declared by the drug traffickers there. However, the $ 65 million is coming out of a discretionary fund available for fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. The strategy covers fiscal 1990. Scowcroft had not intended to add the $ 65 million onto next year's budget, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with his top lieutenants in the drug war Tuesday at his vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> to discuss the strategy, but sources said Wednesday that the focus of the meeting was <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, not the strategy, and that no specific decisions were made on changing plans for future aid to that country. `` The fundamental issues of the strategy, <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> did not change,'' one of the sources said, noting that the final strategy had gone to the printer before the meeting took place. The source declined to be named publicly. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has suffered numerous bombings by drug traffickers since Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> imposed emergency regulations 1 -LCB- weeks ago that allow for the immediate resumption of extraditions of alleged drug traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for trial. Last Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would give <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> $ 65 million in military equipment such as helicopters, in addition to some $ 2.5 million for protection for the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> judiciary that had been promised previously. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year set aside $ 5 million for such protection. Colombian Justice Minister <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> reiff </PERSON> asked Tuesday for $ 19 million in aid for judicial protection. The drug strategy, meanwhile, will urge states to impose tough laws against drug users, but wo n't threaten to withhold highway funds from those states that fail to do so, as the draft strategy had proposed, an administration source said Wednesday. In addition, a proposed $ 25 million <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, to be run jointly by the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, was eliminated from the strategy due to a last-minute bid by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to develop a money-laundering intelligence center and combine all the elements, the source said. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> objected to the sudden change of plans. `` Justice said, ` Wait a minute. Let's step back and do this right,''' said the source. However, most of the elements included in the draft strategy _ the emphasis on targeting drug abusers who fuel the drug traffic, the hiking of funds for drug treatment by 49 percent and the need for massively increased aid to the Andean countries _ remain the same as proposed originally by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, the source said. The final strategy is being kept under such `` close hold'' by the White House that many people who received copies of the draft must go to the Old Executive Office Building to read the final version. `` Aside from the copy in the OEOB, I think the only people who have it are those on the Domestic Policy Council, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and a few of the president's closest advisers,'' the source said. Copies of the draft strategy were leaked to the press shortly after it was produced in late July. In <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Wednesday, the vacation White House press office announced that a new program allowing judges to strip student loans and other federal benefits from drug offenders starts Friday. The vacationing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a report on Wednesday spelling out how the penalties will work in both state and federal courts. Those convicted of drug trafficking or possession can be denied federal grants, student loans, contracts, and professional and commercial licenses, but not welfare, disability or Social Security benefits. The decision to deny any or all of an individual's benefits rests solely with the sentencing judge, except for those convicted of a third drug trafficking offense. For them, permanent denial of the benefits is mandatory. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> outlined plans to carry out the program, required by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. He said he is asking the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sentencing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to inform federal courts of the program, and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will serve as a clearinghouse of information on those stripped of their benefit eligibility in the federal courts. In addition, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will `` coordinate the participation of the state courts in this program.'' It will ask the chief judicial officer in each state to direct its courts to collect and forward the data on state court denials. Justice will then forward the information to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for inclusion on the federal procurement debarment list. The penalties can be applied to convictions occurring after Friday for offenses occuring on or after Nov. 18, 1988. Next Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will go on radio and television to describe his new national drug strategy that is expected to stiffen penalties for individual users.

<HEAD>Second Shipload of PCBs Arrives in Quebec Town</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 BAIE-COMEAU, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A second shipload of PCBs arrived at this <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> port Wednesday, the day after riot police used clubs to disperse protesters so an earlier shipment could be moved to temporary storage nearby. Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Corriveau </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Quebec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> turned down applications by a citizen coalition in <LOCATION> Baie-Comeau </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s hometown, for injunctions forbidding long-term storage of polychlorinated biphenals, or PCBs, from elsewhere in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. It was the second consecutive day the coalition lost a legal battle to prevent the unloading of toxic PCBs produced in St.-Basile-le-Grand, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, and destined for a nearby <ORGANIZATION> Hydro-Quebec </ORGANIZATION> storage site. The waste was shipped to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for destruction, but longshoremen refused to unload it. On Tuesday, shortly after refusal of the first applications, police cleareed the way to the Manic 2 storage site for six trucks loaded with PCB-laced oil. A V-formation of about 40 helmeted officers, truncheons held chest-high, pushed through dozens of noisy demonstrators so the convoy could leave the dock. Police said no one was injured and there were no arrests. The waste had been on the wharf for six days after arriving on the <PERSON> Nadezhda </PERSON> <PERSON> Obukhova </PERSON>, a Soviet freighter. Another Soviet freighter, the <PERSON> Khudozhnik </PERSON> <PERSON> Pakhomov </PERSON>, arrived Wednesday after a two-week voyage from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Provincial police tightened patrols around the dock area and closed the area to passers-by. `` It's not over yet,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a lawyer for the coalition of citizen groups. `` This is just one battle that has been lost.'' The shuttle of PCBs back and forth across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> has been seen as an embarrassment for Quebec Premier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as the Sept. 25 provincial election approaches PCBs produce toxic byproducts such as dioxins and furans when incompletely burned.

<HEAD>Welfare Department Issued Fake Social Security Numbers to Illegals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> welfare workers assigned hundreds of dummy Social Security numbers to illegal immigrants to enable them to receive millions of dollars in state benefits. Federal officials said Wednesday there's nothing illegal about it. But Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says it's got to stop because it goes against his new efforts to crack down on aid to illegal aliens, which he says the state can no longer afford. The practice started after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> issued a 1985 executive order barring state agencies from asking people applying for state services about their citizenship status. But citizens or not, the computerized welfare records required a case identification number for each person, and that had to be a nine-digit number since for most people the ID is the same as their Social Security number. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' legal counsel, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, said the law setting up the general relief program, a totally state-financed welfare program for people who do n't qualify for federal welfare, left it up to the Welfare Department if applicants did n't have a Social Security number. Welfare spokeswoman <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Regunberg </PERSON> said the department issued its own control numbers. Welfare Department attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON> said the dummy numbers started with a three-digit prefix not used by the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Regunberg </PERSON> said those control numbers would have been rejected by <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> computers, so they could not have been used to obtain federally subsidized welfare or by an illegal alien seeking a job. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said there is nothing illegal under federal law with using ID numbers with the same number of digits as Social Security numbers. `` As far as we are concerned, there is nothing illegal,'' <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said. Welfare Commissioner <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Camino-Siegrist </PERSON> said illegal aliens made up 400 to 500 of the 28,500 people in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> getting General Relief. Both she and Human Services Secretary <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said some recipients without Social Security numbers were <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens who were mentally ill or severely mentally retarded and had never obtained a Social Security card. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Wednesday he had not known dummy numbers were issued to illegals applying for general relief. `` But I think in fairness to the people at the <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, they were trying to help some folks who basically came in off the street, were in dire need and had no other means of support,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in an interview with radio station <ORGANIZATION> WTAG </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>, where he was on an official trip. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that in many cases the people `` were political refugees who faced death if they went back to their home countries.'' However, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> announced recently he was changing state policy to remove illegal aliens from relief rolls, a move officials estimated would save about $ 1 million a year. `` Because of the fiscal situation, we just ca n't continue to do this and we wo n't. We've got to stop it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Muriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Heiberger </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, said she may challenge the change of policy in court. `` This move on the part of the governor represents a tragic retreat from the commonwealth's previous commitment to help people who fled their countries because of persecution, violence or economic necessity,'' she said.

 <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pisar </PERSON> saw the 50th anniversary of World War II as a time to celebrate the triumph over evil, but the dispute over a convent near the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp he survived has cast a shadow on his efforts at reconciliation. At the request of composer <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pisar </PERSON> has written a personal reminiscence of the destruction in his native land that he will read at a concert Friday to mark the anniversary of the 1939 invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that began the war. `` I decided to tackle it out of solidarity and out of a need for reconciliation, because I do n't believe in hereditary enemies of history,'' <PERSON> Pisar </PERSON> said. `` This 50th anniversary is a very good moment to celebrate our triumph over evil and move to a more hopeful future. I am telling a Polish story, but also a Jewish story,'' he said. <PERSON> Pisar </PERSON> will narrate the concert which is to be broadcast live to more than 20 countries. He plans to relate his experience, which he says epitomizes that of many who endured World War II. He was 10 when the war struck his home city of <LOCATION> Bialystok </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. His mother wanted to flee, but his father, whose family had been in <LOCATION> Bialystok </LOCATION> for several generations, did not. <PERSON> Pisar </PERSON> was the only member of his family to survive the years that followed. The Gestapo killed his father and he lost his mother and sister to the concentration camps that claimed the lives of at least 6 million other Jews. Sent from <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> to camps in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as a forced laborer, <PERSON> Pisar </PERSON> escaped from <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION> and was liberated by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> at the age of 16. Now a lawyer in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pisar </PERSON> has made three previous trips to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, accompanying <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> senators, international bankers and former <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing. This trip is more personal. <PERSON> Pisar </PERSON> brought his wife and three children with him to visit his native city of <LOCATION> Bialystok </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and then to travel to <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>. They have arrived to find that 50 years has not healed the spiritual wounds of war, and that the historic tension between Catholic and Jews still impedes reconciliation. The Roman Catholic hierarchy's decision Aug. 10 to abrograte a 1987 agreement to move a Carmelite convent away from the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> camp and remarks Saturday by the leader of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church has left many Jews, including <PERSON> Pisar </PERSON>, troubled. `` I am happy to be here and I feel that peace is fragile and the spark of freedom that we witness here today and that is so encouraging, is fragile and yet I feel a discomfort, I feel a pain, deep physical pain,'' <PERSON> Pisar </PERSON> said. `` For some strange reason at this precise moment of history to focus on tensions between Jews and Poles _ the two people that suffered more than any others from the Second World War _ seems not only unnecessary but ... why give <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, posthumously, such a satisfaction?'' he said. As one of the youngest camps survivors, <PERSON> Pisar </PERSON> says he feels compelled to speak out. `` I do n't want any polemics with the cardinal, but with due respect, his words, even if well-intended, were ill-chosen. I am disappointed and surprised,'' <PERSON> Pisar </PERSON> said. He was referring to an address by Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Jasna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monastery </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Czestochowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most revered shrine, in which <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> said there would be no anti-Semitism in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> if Jews abandon anti-Polish sentiments. Speaking about the convent, <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> said the nuns wanted to be a symbol of human solidarity with the living and the dead and that asking them to leave would offend the feelings of Poles. <PERSON> Pisar </PERSON> acknowledged that not only Jews were killed in <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, but he said the site belongs to no one and that he could not tolerate the appropriation of the Holocaust by Christian symbols. `` <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> is a place that belongs to everybody and no one,'' he said. `` It is the greatest wound ever inflicted on our civilization and its deserves respect ... silence.'' `` I feel no anger to the Carmelite nuns. I think they are sincere in their desire to pray. I respect that, but I think it would be better if they prayed outside the perimeter of the death camp and I think God would be able to hear them better if they did,'' he said. <PERSON> Pisar </PERSON> said he hoped that Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> would use his moral authority to stop the dispute before it festers. `` He can bring it to a stop, and I wish he would, and that the dead would be left alone because it is really needed out of respect for the dead and compassion for the living.'' He said.

 School lunchroom cooks are hampered in efforts to provide nutritious meals because the government donates mainly `` fat-laden foods'' such as ground beef, pork and luncheon meats, a consumer health group said Wednesday. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the agency responsible for administering the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lunch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, for `` not providing the critical leadership necessary to speed progress in reducing fat in school lunches.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, acting administator of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, countered by saying the department is committed to dietary guidelines developed jointly with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. He said the guidelines do n't set quantitative standards for fat. `` There is no scientific consensus on appropriate levels of fat in children's diets,'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. And the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> noted in a statement that `` children's eating habits are influenced by multiple factors such as home, school, and restaurants.'' It said parents and community groups must share responsibility for improving young people's dietary preferences. The consumer group said its survey of school food service directors shows, nevertheless, that the government school lunch program lends little encouragement to dieticians seeking to lower the fat content of lunches. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> said 67 percent of 177 school food service directors surveyed told it that the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s commodity distribution program is one of the most significant barriers to their efforts to provide nutritious meals. More than 24 million children participated in lunch programs at more than 91,000 schools during the 1988-89 academic year. The school lunch programs depend, to some extent, on commodities provided free of charge by the federal government, to help them stay afloat financially, the group said. `` Yet,'' it said, `` the commodities offered include a high proportion of fat-laden foods.'' <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> said that Agriculture Department-disbursed commodity foods account for about 30 percent of foods used for school lunches. Of the total estimated dollar value of the commodities available _ $ 817.4 million _ ground beef and pork, luncheon meat and ham, butter, cheese and eggs constituted well over 50 percent, it said. Of the `` bonus'' commodities offered to schools _ or commodities furnished above the basic allotments _ butter, cheese, pork, beef, and eggs comprised more than 90 percent of the dollar value, the group said. It said that more than 80 percent of the directors surveyed said they have taken some steps to reduce fat in their school lunches. Contrary to <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>'s statement, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> said there is a consensus among health professionals that fat in children's diets should be reduced to about 30 percent of calories. Among other findings were these: _ Only 6 percent of the directors surveyed had established target levels or ranges for fat in their programs Central city school districts were eight times more likely to establish such limits than were rural districts. _ Seventy-seven percent reported having limited access to written matrials or training programs on how to purchase foods or modify recipes to reduce fat content Twenty-three percent said they did not receive any guidance or guidelines. _ When asked to identify the single most important thing that could be done to help reduce fat, 50 percent of the respondents said the commodity program should be changed and 26 percent said more nutritional education should be provided The remaining 24 percent were uncertain. Public Voice recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> provide greater leadership in educating school food service directors and in offering assistance in planning monthly menus, including suggesting how often specific foods should be served. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also should significantly expand the availability of lower-fat commodities to the schools, the group said. Said <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>: `` It is important to remember that no matter what level is deemed appropriate, that level must be applied to a person's entire diet, not to a single food or a single meal. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> can not at this time support setting quantitative fat standards or recommended frequency of serving certain foods.'' The variety of foods donated to schools is under constant review, he said, adding that `` over the years significant progress has been made in providing more and more healthy, wholesome foods, including additional low-and reduced-fat foods.'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> also said his agency promotes and coordinates nutrition education and technical assistance for all involved in the school lunch program, although he said that states `` have great flexibility in how they spend the money they have available for training.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said in its statement that young people's dietary habits are largely affected by national advertising, which it called `` a major influence on children's food preferences.'' `` If change is to become a reality, dietary modifications in school menus must be supported by parents and the community,'' it said.

 It was an invitation Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> was only too happy to refuse. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> received a form letter signed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saying he had been nominated by Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, to the Republican Senatorial Inner Circle, a clique of party loyalists who give at least $ 1,000 a year to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Problem is, <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> is a Democrat _ a very liberal Democrat. `` The Inner Circle has many outstanding members including <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON>, <PERSON> Estee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzenegger </PERSON>,'' the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> letter said. `` I know you will enjoy meeting your fellow members at Inner Circle gatherings both in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and around the country.'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said Wednesday he respectfully declines. `` And all this time I thought I was a dyed-in-the-wool liberal,'' he said. `` Either my fellow congressmen from across the aisle have had a change of heart or I've been terribly misinformed about their political philosophy.'' But why would <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> nominate <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> in the first place? According to <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Zenia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mucha </PERSON>, he did n't. `` The senator lends his name for fund-raising for the party,'' she said. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>'s name `` must have been on some mailing list that was not purged.'' <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMocker </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We're not going to consider it a mistake. We're going to say, well, there's hope for everybody. She ticked the names off several onetime Democrats who switched to the GOP: <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>. `` And so if Congressman <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> received one of these, well, we've certainly had a lot of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> recently convert to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said

 Republican <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>'s election to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after an ethnically divisive campaign for the late <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>'s seat was celebrated Wednesday as a first for Cuban-Americans and a Southern milestone for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Cubans won!'' salsa singer <PERSON> Celia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> shouted in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> as she led Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>'s supporters in a victory party early Wednesday following the Republican's win over <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, a 37-year-old educator and state senator, promised to work to heal the wounds left by the contest, which ended Tuesday with voting along ethnic lines. `` I think it's been a terribly divisive ... campaign,'' she said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. The special election was made necessary by <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>'s death May 30 at 88. Pepper, a Democrat, had held the seat since its creation in 1962 Riding heavy Hispanic turnout, the Havana-born Republican received 49,638 votes, or 53 percent, to 43,759 votes, or 47 percent, for <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, a 38-year-old, Brooklyn-born attorney making his first bid for elective office. Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, who carried the black and non-Latin white vote by about 90 percent, had spurred Hispanics by making them feel as if `` we might be second-class Americans because we're naturalized Americans.'' `` But now it's time for healing, now we have to reach out to all those sections,'' she said. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> did n't rule out seeking the seat again in the next scheduled election in 14 months but promised to try to help his opponent to `` unify the community.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>'s swearing-in in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is expected to take place early next month. Cubans, who began Latinizing <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s 1959 revolution, have achieved a number of firsts this decade: mayor of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, a majority on the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, county manager and city manager. During the campaign, Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> refused to debate <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> for declaring, `` This is an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> seat'' _ a remark that many claimed was anti-Hispanic. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> said the remark was an appeal to voters to decide according to candidates' qualifications, not birthplace. He also said he was responding to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s statement that the party wanted to elect a Cuban-American <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> charged <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> with misusing his remark. `` It was unfortunate that something said over three months ago was taken totally out of context and used divisively by the <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> campaign,'' he said. `` I think they paid the price for it.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> expressed delight at the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s latest Southern success; the party picked up a seat held by a liberal Democrat for 27 years and won its first congressional victory in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` For us to win it is a major victory,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- Democratic Chairman -RRB- <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was saying it was their seat, it was the gateway to the South.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> added to its unprecedented majority, now 11-8, in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> delegation. The campaign by Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, who is married to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>, included appearances by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Her campaign chairman was the president's son <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, anti-abortion activists claimed Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>'s election proves that their movement is `` alive and well'' in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s July 3 decision narrowing the right to an abortion During the campaign, Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> said she favored more restrictions on abortion and <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> said he favored more choice.

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., unveiled on Wednesday `` debt-for-drugs'' legislation intended to offer debt-relief incentives to Latin American nations that subsidize the withdrawal of farm land from coca production The legislation, to be introduced when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reconvenes next week, is modeled on debt-for-nature exchanges already in place to help protect tropical rain forests. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> asserted in a statement that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment of $ 400 million in a debt-for-drugs plan could free up enough funds to subsidize the withdrawal of every acre in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> now in coca production. Coca crops are refined to produce cocaine, one of the principal illicit drugs on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics market. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, who is to deliver the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nationally televised adddress on drug policy next Tuesday evening, said that for the immediate future the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must continue to extradite foreign drug traffickers for trial in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts. `` But in the long run, the best way to cut coca production is to provide economic incentives to grow other crops,' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., who returned this week from a 14-day visit to nine Latin American countries, contends that substituting other crops for coca will simply spread production of the enormously profitable crop to other countries <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said the best hope is an intensive campaign to reduce narcotic consumption in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by discouraging first-time and casual users and by rehabilitating addicts. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, however, said his plan can work in the countries involved and has a `` realistic prospect of winning public support in this country.'' `` It is not a giveaway with no strings attached,'' he said. `` Americans love a good deal, and the debt-for-drugs plan is exactly that.'' Under the <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> legislation the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, hopefully with the help of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies, would create an international fund to negotiate debt-for-drugs exchanges. The fund would purchase debt owed to foreign banks by the governments of coca-producing nations. Once a sizeable amount of debt had been acquired the fund would offer to forgive a coca-producing nation's interest on it for a year in exchange for subsidies to shift farmers out of coca production. Once coca reduction targets were reached, the fund would forgive the outstanding debt in full.

<TEXT>
 The government kept secret the formula it will unveil this week for a new administration, but it increased security throughout <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Wednesday in anticipation of violent demonstrations. Officials of the current administration have made clear that the new government will be announced and will take office on Friday, when the term of Acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> expires. It will have the blessing of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who as commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces is the power behind the civilian administration. The Defense Forces include both soldiers and police. Paramilitary groups organized into national defense committees trained in different sites throughout the capital on Wednesday and government agencies said they were placing themselves on a state of alert. Opposition leaders said they planned no street protests against the installation of a new government on Friday. `` If anything happens, it will be spontaneous,'' said former opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> in an interview Wednesday. `` Nothing special is going to happen on Friday. The government will change some figures and will retain others.'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> claims he won the May 7 elections, which were annulled by the government. The opposition refused a government offer to form a national reconciliation government. The government rejected opposition demands that its victory be recognized and that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> step down. Government officials said all formulas were being considered in the formation of the new government. However, sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said it appeared the new government would consist of a junta with civilian and military representatives. The governemnt scheduled a special Cabinet session for Thursday morning. A special session of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> will be held in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday at the request of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government after a Panamanian OAS delegate challenged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to present evidence of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged involvement in drug trafficking. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in February 1988. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has commanded the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> since 1983 and is considered the country's most powerful figure. He has become the target of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campaign to remove him, and internally he is accused by the political opposition of repression and violation of human rights. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request for a special <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> meeting an attempt `` to divert the continent's attention away from what should be the main issue.'' The focus of attention should be <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aggression, not <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, he said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denies the drug trafficking charges and accuses the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of trying to oust him because of his nationalistic policies. Opposition leaders said Wednesday that arrests announced by the government were part of the `` propaganda and repression campaign of the military.'' Former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that 11 persons had been arrested, most of them members of this <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

In a directive issued late Tuesday, the oversight board told the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> it could get started, but the panel said it must be consulted before completion of transactions involving financing or loss guarantees.

 Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> was preparing to present new drug charges against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at a special meeting Thursday of the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. The 31-nation session was set at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request after <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last week challenged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for evidence of its charges of drug involvement against Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The 18-month unsuccessful <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campaign to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as the behind-the-scenes ruler in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is getting only lukewarm support from the hemisphere group. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers last week adopted a bland statement expressing concern about the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is hoping <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>'s response to the challenge will put more zip in the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> approach. Two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand juries have already indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug smuggling charges. This week <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have hinted to reporters there is more evidence against him. It is not clear how far <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> will go in documenting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations since prosecutors would not want any court case jeopardized. In requesting the meeting, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, the acting permanent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted to present `` a summary of the evidence and elaboration of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> position on the critical situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> demanded in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> the right to cross-examine witnesses who were to appear before the organization. The letter also asked for the `` opportunity to prove ... that the indictments against General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> are motivated politically representing nothing more than ` indictment dipolomacy.''' <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, confirmed on Wednesday that <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> would focus on narcotics, but she declined to offer any details in order `` not to pre-empt what the Deputy Secretary will be saying tomorrow.'' The term of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s provisional president, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, who was hand-picked by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, expires on Thursday. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and Panamanian opponents of the general are concerned <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will name a puppet government and not hold free elections. With tempers rising, <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> last week compared <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and derided <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as an `` outlaw regime'' that deserves the censure of all OAS states. Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> walked out, and in a vitriolic 2-hour rebuttal, Panamanian delegate <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON> blamed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for lack of progress toward a political solution. `` If you have any evidence to show Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is involved in drug trafficking, bring it here to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British Foreign office on Wednesday urged <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down and `` open the way to a peaceful, democratic resolution of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s problems.''

 A woman who contends she killed her lesbian lover because she was a victim of `` battered spouse syndrome'' had been abused for years and feared for her life, her lawyer said at her trial Wednesday. <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 30, was beaten and tormented for 11 years before she fired a .38 - caliber pistol into the head of <PERSON> Ivonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>, 32, after a Halloween party last year, said defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasley </PERSON> hopes to introduce expert testimony at the murder trial to prove she suffered from battered spouse syndrome and acted in self-defense. Attorneys for both sides believe the trial is one of the first in which the syndrome defense, usually employed in cases involving long-term abusive heterosexual relationships, has been applied in one involving a homosexual union. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s love for Ms. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>'s teen-age twin daughters kept her from ending the stormy relationship, <PERSON> Lasley </PERSON> said during a break in the first day of testimony Wednesday. `` For 11 years, she was the mother of -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>'s -RRB- twins and performed the domestic duties of the relationship,'' <PERSON> Lasley </PERSON> said. `` She was frequently battered and abused physically and psychologically, along with the children.'' Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON> is expected to rule next week whether to allow experts to testify about battered spouse syndrome. Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> has said he'll challenge any attempt to bring the syndrome into the case because, he said, there is no research involving homosexual relationships. The prosecution maintains that Ms. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> was killed while she was in the closet of the mobile home the women shared. `` <PERSON> Ivonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> was down on her knees in the closet begging for her life,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told jurors Tuesday. Jurors on Wednesday got a glimpse of the events that night in a taped interview police had with Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> hours after the shooting. The women, who had been drinking, had just returned from the party when an argument erupted, and Ms. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> pulled out her gun from the closet, Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said on the tape. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said she grabbed a knife that had been on a nightstand because she thought Ms. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> would kill her. `` I was afraid,'' she said. `` There was a point I thought she was going to shoot me and I just ran into her'' and grabbed the gun. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said she did n't recall firing the weapon or what happened to the knife, but admitted to the slaying. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, who worked at a plant nursery last year, said the relationship had been bad for a long time. `` It was driving me nuts,'' she said. If convicted, Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> could face life in prison.

 Officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have approved a draft U.S.-Soviet accord on how to conduct inspections of chemical arms sites under a future comprehensive ban on the weapons, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator said Wednesday. Superpower negotiators in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> meanwhile completed a proposed agreement on guidelines for the gradual destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles and installations over a 10-year period, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON> said. Both issues are major parts of long-standing, 40-nation negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on a global convention banning production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side and the Soviets had not yet agreed on how to carry out a proposed exchange of chemical arms data between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> before a convention is ready. He commented after the latest 10-day round of periodic U.S.-Soviet expert talks on chemical weapons. The paper approved in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deals with procedures for so-called challenge inspections in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the two countries with the biggest chemical arsenals. Under the proposed worldwide ban, challenge inspection will allow any country to demand a short-notice, spot probe by international experts of any suspected chemical weapons site. Points covered in the U.S.-Soviet accord include how to trigger inspections and how to deal with their findings, <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON> said in an interview in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission's daily newsletter.

<HEAD>Sheriff Defends 911 Dispatcher's Actions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A woman who dialed 911 to report her estranged husband was on his way to kill her was told to call back if he arrived. Fifteen minutes later the woman and three others were shot to death at a birthday party. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Delia </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> was slain Sunday after being warned by a brother-in-law that her husband was going to shoot up her 27th birthday party, authorities said. Sheriff <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON> defended the 911 dispatcher's actions Wednesday. `` The dispatcher did, in fact, function properly,'' <PERSON> Block </PERSON> said a news conference. `` She did not violate any department policies or procedures.'' `` It is one of those tragic situations. We all wish it would have turned out another way. But this deputy sheriff did not act improperly.'' Last January, Mrs. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> obtained a restraining order barring <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> from going within 100 yards of her residence. Block said there was a history of violence between Mrs. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> and her husband. On Sunday, Mrs. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> was warned by a brother of <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> that her husband was coming with a gun, police said. She dialed 911, told the dispatcher of the restraining order and said she believed <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> would carry out his threat of violence. According to a transcript, this exchange that followed: Deputy: `` He has n't come over there?'' <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>: `` No, he has n't.'' Deputy: `` But he's just threatening to do so?'' <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>: `` Yes, and I'm sure he will.'' Deputy: `` Ok, well, the only thing to do is just call us if he comes over there. ... I mean, what can we do? We ca n't have a unit sent there and wait and see if he comes over.'' About 15 minutes later, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> burst into the converted garage Mrs. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> was renting and began firing a handgun, police said. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, 26, was charged Tuesday with four counts of murder and two of attempted murder, and prosecutors specified circumstances that would make him eligible for the death penalty if convicted. He was jailed without bail. In addition to the four dead women, two people were critically wounded. The sheriff expressed sympathy to the victims' families but said the information given in the 911 call did not warrant an immediate response by a patrol car. `` There are threats made all the time,'' he said. `` There is a difference between a threat and a clear and present danger.'' Block said the killings would not lead to any change in department policies. `` 911 is designed primarily to deal with an existent emergency,'' he said, `` and it does that very well.'' Block said 700,000 calls are received on 911 every year, a quarter of them prank calls. About 50,000 calls come to the station that handled Mrs. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>'s call, and each requires a judgment call by the dispatcher, he said. A head of a program for battered women criticized the 911 policy. `` Unless the danger is imminent, law enforcement does n't give it a high priority,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, program director at <ORGANIZATION> Haven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. `` The criteria for determining imminent danger should be examined.''

 Leaders of <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> tried to placate outraged minorities Wednesday by considering a watered-down version of legislation to make Moldavian the official language in the ethnically diverse southern republic. At the urging of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, reports said, the Moldavians were leaning toward the compromise in an effort to stop strikes by ethnic Russians and others opposed to the pending language law. Non-Moldavians were reported on strike at 200 businesses and industries in the small republic next to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said rail workers in several cities joined the walkout Wednesday. Under the original proposal, Moldavian would be the only official language. The compromise would make it the language of officials and documents, but Russian would be the everyday tongue for contact among ethnic groups. In the restive Baltic republics, the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> indicated willingness Wednesday to accept competing political parties, activists reported. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has repeatedly voiced opposition to multiple political parties. <PERSON> Ianis </PERSON> <PERSON> Krummins </PERSON>, deputy editor of <LOCATION> Atmoda </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> expressed support for eliminating a clause in the republic's constitution that defines the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as the leading force of society and the political system <PERSON> Krummins </PERSON> said he listened to a live radio broadcast of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> capital. The clause is virtually identical to one in the Soviet constitution that has put an effective ban on alternative parties for 70 years, <PERSON> Krummins </PERSON> said. Several small political parties have cropped in recent months, most of them in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and the other two Baltic republics, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Semen </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossu </PERSON>, suggested the language compromise to the legislature Wednesday after speaking with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on the telephone, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Grossu </PERSON> did not say whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested the compromise although, but that is widely believed to be the case, <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Nestase </PERSON> of the pro-Moldavian <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said by telephone from the republic's capital, <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> now has no language law. Russian traditionally has been the tongue for government affairs and is commonly used in commerce, which upsets native Moldavians. The compromise would cut a part of the bill that would have made Moldavian the language of communication among Russians, Ukrainians, Jews, Bulgarians, and other ethnic groups in the republic. The initial law goes farther than the language laws in a number of other republics. Many non-Moldavians do not speak Moldavian, but they share some knowledge of Russian as a result of Soviet schooling. <PERSON> Grossu </PERSON> suggested adding a line in the Moldavian constitution that would specify using Russian as the `` language of inter-ethnic communication,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. People's Front activists who are backing the language law said they were inclined to accept <PERSON> Grossu </PERSON>'s suggestion. `` We think this is the most realistic compromise,'' said <PERSON> Nataly </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascal </PERSON> of the People's Front in a telephone interview. `` We support this compromise and we're not the only ones.'' The Moldavian Supreme Soviet began debating the proposed law Tuesday, and <PERSON> Nestase </PERSON> said the session would continue Thursday. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has quietly been involved in several attempts recently to quell unrest that has surfaced in many of the ethnically diverse Soviet republics, some of which retain strong nationalist identities. He told the Lithuanian party chief during the weekend that the independence movement in that former nation had gone too far. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also `` worked out'' with other members of the ruling Politburo a tough party statement Saturday condemning nationalism, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said Tuesday. The statement by the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> warned that independence movements were leading the country into an `` abyss.'' A strike organizer in the Moldavian city of <LOCATION> Tiraspol </LOCATION>, where Russians and other minorities walked off their jobs last week to protest the proposed language law, said strikers were willing to consider the compromise even though they would still prefer that Russian and Moldavian be given equal status. The weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday said unemployment as a factor in the republic's unrest. It said at least 150,000 of the republic's 4.2 million people are without jobs, and the number is growing Pravda repeated earlier criticism of <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> activists, accusing them of `` spreading the seeds of separatism and nationalism'' and claiming that Moldavian parliamentarians ordered the Pravda correspondent to leave the republic. The proposed language law also would restore the Latin alphabet, replacing the Cyrillic alphabet imposed by dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> after he annexed <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in 1940. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> imposed Cyrillic, which is used in Russian, to back his claim that Romanians and Moldavians are two distinct nationalities. Ethnic Moldavians make up 64 percent of the republic's population Tensions between the Moldavians and non-Moldavians have been running high since the People's Front began organizing early this year to push the language law and other demands to give them more autonomy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Swindall Says Father Abused Him and Siblings; Father Denies It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, sentenced to prison this week for lying to a federal grand jury, says he did n't take the stand at his perjury trial for fear of revealing he and his siblings were abused by their father. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s father denied the allegations, and a prosecutor said the former congressman was suffering from `` a severe case of Monday morning quarterbacking.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that he and his siblings were all abused by their father, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>. He said he and his brothers, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, and his sister, <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON>, discussed the matter and agreed he should come forward. He gave no details of his alleged abuse. The 38-year-old Republican who represented <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s eastern suburbs in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for two terms until his defeat in 1988 was sentenced Monday to a year in prison and fined $ 30,000 on nine counts of perjury. He is free on appeal. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was convicted June 20 of lying to a grand jury in 1988 about negotiations for an $ 850,000 loan from a federal agent posing as a drug-money launderer. The loan to help finance his $ 1.5 million Stone Mountain home was never completed. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was convicted of perjury for denying he was told the loan might contain drug profits. He later said he was tired and his memory faulty. `` My father's a very sick man,'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` You can go back to 1966 at <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. You will find that my sister was admitted in June of 1966 with hysterical paralysis.'' <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Wednesday the hospital would not release information on <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>. `` If she's got her own medical records, she can do it for herself, but we certainly would n't do that,'' she said. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> also said he and his brother <PERSON> David </PERSON> were admitted to the hospital for ulcers that same summer. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said he did not believe the allegations would have been raised at trial by the prosecution. `` As far as I can tell this has nothing to do with his case; he's having a severe case of Monday morning quarterbacking,'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said `` There was nothing in evidence relating to this and, I do n't believe, in any pretrial evidence. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> provided reporters with a copy of a 1987 deposition by his father concerning a dispute over a loan for a family business. But he said he had removed a number of pages that referred to allegations of abuse. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s sister said in an interview with The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Journal-Constitution that her father had sexually abused her as a teen-ager but that her siblings had agreed not to discuss the matter publicly until now. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, denied abusing his daughter. `` When anybody accuses me of incest he better be proving it. I deny that completely,'' he said. `` It's strange this would n't come out until there's money involved,'' <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know how much he paid his sister to say these things.''

 The bears are back. Just ask <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Klasnya </PERSON>. `` I was sitting on my back steps, going through a bag of seeds for planting, when I felt something was out there looking at me,'' said <PERSON> Klasnya </PERSON>. The `` something'' was a 200-pound black bear in her back yard relishing the aroma of pork chops frying on the stove. She ran inside, replaced the pork chops with garlic and onions to encourage the bear's departure, clapped her hands and made a fuss until the animal sauntered back into the woods. `` I'm not going to fry pork chops or bacon till the bear season is over,'' she said. Since last week's encounter, police have received more than 20 reports of bear sightings around this Lake Superior city. The bears are in town for their late-summer gorging in greater numbers than in the last two years. The influx, however, does n't come close to the invasion of 1985, when dozens of bears, searching for food here because of poor berry and nut supplies in the woods, were sighted some days. A poor crop of hazelnuts, one of bears' favorite foods, and an increased bear population, is forcing bears to move as far south as <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>, experts say. Researcher <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said bears that come to <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION> looking for a meal feed on clover, apples _ and garbage.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> expanded their imports and exports with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to fill the trade gap as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s economy faced anti-apartheid sanctions in the mid-1980s, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report said Wednesday. A major outbreak of black unrest in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1984 was a pivotal event in that nation's financial affairs, prompting many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and corporations to dissolve their investments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In 1985, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> passed an ordinance specifying that banks providing city services could not extend new loans to <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. But a report by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transnational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporations </ORGANIZATION>, released Wednesday, said that `` although a number of countries have reduced their trade with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, there is evidence that other corporations have filled some of this gap.'' It said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> increased its imports from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by $ 455 million in 1987, compared with the average annual level of imports from 1983-85. In the same period, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s imports increased by $ 242 million, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s by $ 268 million, and West German imports increased $ 187 million. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports dropped $ 557 million in 1987, Danish imports fell $ 92 million and British imports were off by $ 91 million. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> increased its exports to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by $ 357 million in 1987, compared with the annual average in 1983-85, the report said. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s exports were up $ 171 million, and Japanese exports rose by $ 130 million. At the same time, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> fell by $ 349 million, it said. The report concluded, `` International pressures may be applied through foreign trade, disinvestment, and foreign finance.'' `` Disinvestment is perhaps the area with the least significant immediate impact,'' partly because most disinvesting companies sell off their plants or create other non-equity relationships. `` These relationships allow for transfers of technology to the South African economy which are essential to the functioning of that economy,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report noted. It said the electronics and automotive industries in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> particularly benefited from technology transfer through `` equity links, licensing, trade, purchase of know-how and through the flow of human resources.'' The report cited a news release from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> after its disinvestment from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as an example of the irrelevance of equity relationships to the transfer of vital technology. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> passed along its equity in <ORGANIZATION> SAMCOR </ORGANIZATION>, the South African local <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> plant, to the local work force. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report quotes <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> as saying afterward, `` Ford will continue to provide <ORGANIZATION> SAMCOR </ORGANIZATION> with necessary components, licensed use of the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> trademark and management and technical assistance as needed.''

 An international conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> could not produce an agreement and suspended its work Wednesday until warring factions are ready for a compromise to end a generation of violence. `` We need time so the spirit of reconciliation can overcome the spirit of confrontation, but for <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> the hour of peace will come,'' <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> foreign minister, told the delegates just before adjourning the final session. Some delegates said the failure increased the likelihood of full-scale civil war when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraws its military forces Sept. 27 after nearly 11 years of occupation. Last-minute negotiations delayed a final statement by seven hours. It fell far short of the comprehensive settlement delegates from 19 nations hoped to achieve when the conference opened in late July. The statement said the meeting `` achieved progress in elaborating a wide variety of elements necessary for the reaching of a comprehensive settlement to the tragic conflict in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' but added: `` It is not yet possible to achieve a comprehensive settlement. It was therefore decided to suspend the conference.'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> offered to help mediate between the Vietnam-sponsored government of Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and the three-faction rebel alliance led by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> until a coup in 1970. `` We will come back to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said as he left the conference hall. `` The problem is complicated. We must be patient.'' <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> told reporters the work of a fact-finding commission sent to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and other groundwork by the conference may pay off when the parties are ready to compromise. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON>, foreign minister of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, said: `` There have been too many casualties, too much suffering, too much bitterness. ... The very fact that we can sit down together, I think this was quite a feat.'' Delegates left open the possiblity of using committees set up under conference auspices for future talks between the belligerents. According to the final statement, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> `` will begin consultations within six months with the participants in the conference with a view to reconvening the conference.'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> called the meeting when a climate of greater cooperation appeared to make settlement possible, but positions of the Cambodian factions hardened during three weeks of negotiations in small working groups. <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said negotiations broke down on five points, including composition of a transitional government, how to monitor the withdrawal and use of the word `` genocide'' in describing <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rule from April 1975 until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded in December 1978. An estimated 1 million Cambodians died under the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which now is the strongest of the three rebel factions. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> told reporters: `` We know it is the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> who have ruined the outcome of this conference, who have scuttled it.'' He said the conduct of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and its allies suggested they were preparing for civil war and `` it confirms and presages new massacres of millions of Cambodians.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration blamed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> for the collapse of the peace conference, and reiterated reluctant support for a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> role in a transitional government. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said `` it was not possible to achieve a lasting settlement due to the failure of the Vietnamese and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> regime to negotiate constructively on key issues.'' At the same time, she said `` progress was made toward the important goal of a free and independent <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Any progress is welcome and we should build upon it.'' <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Koh </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> delegation, said: `` It will be like <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'' after the Vietnamese withdraw. `` There will be more fighting. The two sides are preparing for war; they're already fighting. Intransigence that marked the meeting throughout held up the final session, which was scheduled to begin in the morning but was delayed until late afternoon. Points of disagreement included an item in a draft of the final statement calling for the Cambodian parties to intensify `` efforts to achieve national reconciliation.'' Both <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which supports the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> objected to the reference to national reconciliation and it was deleted. Their position remains that the government led by <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> is merely a Vietnamese puppet. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said the resistance would reject any international monitoring of the withdrawal `` before the dismantling of the illegal regime of <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> and its replacement by a Cambodian provisional quadrapartite government'' of the three resistance groups and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>.

 City investigators appear ready to conclude that Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> could face civil fines but committed no crimes when he was paid by banks doing business with the city, newspapers reported Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified sources as saying the report from City Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> is due in two weeks. But the sources also cautioned that new information could change the recommendations. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> still faces an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> into his finances. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> plans to recommend the city sue the mayor to collect about $ 200,000 in fines for financial reporting violations, the newspapers said. Such fines are subject to negotiation. `` The mayor has said ... he will answer questions once the report is distributed,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` He will still wait for the final report.'' A spokesman for the City Attorney's office declined comment. The mayor, a former city policeman and councilman, won an unprecedented fifth term April 11. Federal investigators are analyzing <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s many investments with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, the former junk bond king who recently resigned from the investment firm after he was indicted on fraud charges. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s inquiry focuses on the 71-year-old mayor's connection to <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The bank paid <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> $ 18,000 for consulting. After some inquiries by <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, City Treasurer <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> subsequently had $ 2 million in city funds deposited with the bank. Both <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rittenberg </PERSON> deny pressure was applied to make the deposit. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> returned the $ 18,000 consulting fee after allegations of favoritism surfaced. The city attorney is also looking into whether <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> violated conflict-of-interest laws by accepting payments from a savings and loan association, and is examining more than 100 errors in the mayor's disclosures regarding his extensive stock portfolio and property holdings. Sources also said <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s report will not make any recommendations related to <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, who is being investigated for failure to account for $ 180,000 in city funds allocated to the Task Force for Africa-Los Angeles Relations. Ms. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, a longtime friend and business partner of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s, ran the mayoral task force before it was shut down because of persistent debt problems.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> adopted a resolution Wednesday deploring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s deportation of Arabs suspected of organizing the Palestinian uprising, the strongest action it has taken yet on the deportation issue. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused to use its veto power to protect <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and abstained. The resolution passed 14-0. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said deportations are unhelpful and provoke <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> tension in the region. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to feel very strongly about deportations,'' <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said after leaving the council chamber. `` It's a view that we've expressed many times to the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and it's a view that we expressed in our statement today when we abstained on the vote.'' On Sunday, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> deported five Arabs from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, sending four to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and one to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. In July, the council passed a similar resolution using milder language, saying it `` deeply regrets'' such expulsions. That resolution also passed 14-0, with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> abstaining. Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Johanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bein </PERSON> said `` wordings are not important. What is important is that at a time when carnage is going on in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and murders are going on in the -LRB- occupied -RRB- territories ... the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meets here for this nonsense and is very quick to act.'' He added that `` what is disturbing is that it looks like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is giving in.'' Wednesday's resolution `` deplores the continuing deportation by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the occupying power, of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> civilians.'' It asks <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to return those expelled and halt the policy. It also asks <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to abide by the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention that protects the rights of civilians in zones under military occupation. <PERSON> Bein </PERSON> castigated the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for instigating the 20-month-old insurrection. He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is the focus of one-sided Security Council criticism. Palestinians on Dec. 8, 1987, began their uprising against Israeli rule in lands occupied in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, often stoning soldiers and Israeli settlers. At least 554 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with soldiers or Israeli civilians since then. Thirty-eight Israelis also have been killed.

<HEAD>Report Says British Mercenaries Tried To Kill Drug Lord</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Colombia Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A British television station reported Wednesday that 11 British mercenaries were involved in an unsuccessful attempt in June to kill <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, a reputed Colombian cocaine baron. <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said the men were hired by a rival drug gang it did not name to kill <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, said to be a leader of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. It showed film of men in camouflage gear in helicopters and in a jungle, and said the `` exclusive'' footage depicted rehearsals for the June 4 assassination attempt. <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said it understood one of the mercenaries made the film. The attempt failed when one of two helicopters crashed while flying low over the <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> estate, killing the pilot, according to the report. It said the British mercenaries had intended to drop explosives on <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>'s house, land and kill everyone in the area. The report said all the mercenaries survived the crash, implying the pilot was Colombian. Turning to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was concerned and `` the activities of British mercenaries in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has been high on his Cabinet's agenda. They want them investigated by the British government.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said: `` While we are in touch with the Americans about this drug problem, there has been no specific request for an investigation of this kind.'' On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it had asked the British government to investigate allegations that Britons helped train teams of assassins for Colombian drug traffickers. The traffickers have blamed for the assassination of a leading Colombian presidential candidate on Aug. 18, which prompted an unprecedented government crackdown on the drug lords. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Foulkes </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the government should prosecute the mercenaries and cancel their passports. `` It's illegal for British citizens to take up arms against a friendly country and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is friendly,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>.

 Mourners packed a church and the street outside Wednesday to remember a black teen-ager killed last week by a white gang, cheering as the Rev. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> and others demanded an end to racial violence. `` We say, as the Jews say, ` Never again. Never again. Never again,''' the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> leader said to cheers and applause from more than 300 people attending <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' funeral at <ORGANIZATION> Glover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. About 1,000 people stood outside singing hymns and listening to eulogies for <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, 16, who was shot to death in the predominantly white <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> a week ago. The service began an hour after two white <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> youths, including one identified as the gang's leader, were charged with murder. Both remained free on bail. Police continued hunting for an 18-year-old man believed to be the triggerman. `` As long as white children can get away with killing black children, and white law enforcement does not know how to make examples of its own ... then justice is far off,'' <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> said. While none of the speakers advocated violence, the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> indicated the time for a passive response to such incidents had passed. `` We're not going to let you down. They're going to pay this time, <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>. `` It's time for us to change our ways. We can run a man for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but we ca n't walk a child through <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' slaying triggered a racial furor in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> unseen since a black man died fleeing a white mob in the <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. `` Let freedom ring from <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, Mr. <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON>,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, pastor of the church and a cousin of the victim, said, addressing Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. `` Let freedom ring from <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION>. We're not going to take it anymore. We're going to walk where we want to walk.'' <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> and three friends were answering an ad for a used car when up to 30 whites carrying bats, golf clubs and at least one gun, confronted them and killed him, authorities said. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, both Democrats, and Republican mayoral hopeful <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> were heckled outside the church. The mayor left through a side door. Democratic mayoral candidates <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> also attended the funeral. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, who is black, was welcomed as he entered the church. <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, the director and star of the racial-issue film `` Do The Right Thing,'' sat near <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' parents. Some mourners distributed fliers calling for a demonstration Thursday to protest <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' slaying.

 More than a decade of research and development culminated Wednesday in federal approval of a steel container to hold plutonium-contaminated trash during shipment to a repository in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved TRUPACT-2, which the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will use to haul waste to its Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, a desert repository carved out of salt beds 2,150 feet below the surface of the Earth. TRUPACT-2 _ a cylindrical, stainless-steel vault-within-a-vault with 10 inches of polyurethane cushioning in between _ was designed and tested by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. It is manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packaging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Federal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> `` This certainly is one of the critical milestones to opening the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tollison </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> manager of waste transportation for the plant, 26 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tollison </PERSON> said the 10-foot containers will cost about $ 200,000 each and the trailers to haul them about $ 20,000 apiece. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Neill </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evaluation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a federally funded state watchdog agency, said of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s approval, `` We're real pleased it passed muster.'' But <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear waste safety project, said the product was not adequately evaluated. The organization is a private, non-profit watchdog group. A longer evaulation `` would have included the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> reviewing the quality assurance program,'' said <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tollison </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> had been reviewing the container program, which had its birth in the late 1970s, since 1987. TRUPACT stands for Transuranic Packaging Transporter. Transuranic wastes are those contaminated with radioactive elements heavier than uranium. The waste includes such things as gloves and tools. Each TRUPACT-2 container will hold up to 14 55-gallon drums of radioactive waste generated by the nation's weapons plants. The TRUPACT-2 containers will be carried three at a time aboard special trailers to WIPP. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that the government expects to ship 600 truckloads to WIPP each year for 25 years, with the trucks watched by satellite. The desert repository has been built, but its 1988 opening was postponed because of concerns about its safety, delays in getting the land around the site withdrawn from public use and lack of certification for the TRUPACT. Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has said the site wo n't open until he is sure all the technical concerns are resolved.

<HEAD>Ethical Rules Say Parent Can Donate Liver to Child</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> have proposed that transplants in which only a piece of the liver is taken from a living donor be limited in most cases to parents supplying organs to their children. The idea, published in Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, was offered for discussion in hopes the medical profession eventually will adopt such ethical guidelines. Doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> drew up the rules before attempting their first transplant of a section of liver from a living donor. Transplants involving whole or partial livers taken from the dead are routine in many places. But because these organs are in scarce, some doctors would like to begin transplanting parts of organs taken from the living. Because the body has only one liver, the organ can not be entirely removed for transplant. The new surgery would remove one lobe of a healthy person's liver and transplant it into an infant. The missing part of the donor's liver eventually grows back, and in the baby, the piece of organ grows along with the child `` We believe that from the perspectives of both recipient and donor, the benefits outweigh the risks and that it is ethically appropriate to proceed with a trial of liver transplantation using a parent as a living donor,'' wrote Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> A. Singer and colleagues. The guidelines resulted from a year-long series of seminars and discussions. The doctors proposed that the donor should be the child's parent or, in rare cases, a mature sibling or grandparent. They said that when the donor is related to the recipient, the benefits of saving a life are most rewarding. Such transplants also have the best chance of succeeding. A team led by Dr. <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> surgeons hopes to perform the first such operation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this fall. The operation has already been done in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Doctors say that because of the shortage of organs from cadavers, up to half of all babies who need new livers die while awaiting transplants.

<HEAD>Fewer Fires in Amazon This Year But Damage Still Extensive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of fires set in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rain forest has dropped from last year but the region is still suffering extensive damage, government scientists said Wednesday. They say the burning increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and adds to the greenhouse effect, which causes a global warming. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said experts in the past two months detected 59,000 fires that devastated 12,700 square miles of forest _ an area larger than <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. That represents roughly 1.5 percent of the so-called legal <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION>, a 2 million-square-mile region. `` We're certainly going to have fewer fires and less destruction in 1989 than in 1988, primarily because we've had unusually heavy rains this year,'' <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone from <PERSON> Sao </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, 210 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. In 1988, about 45,600 square miles were destroyed by 205,000 fires, <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON> said. The institute monitors fires in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> by using satellites that detect smoke and heat. <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON> said the government helped reduce the number of fires, mainly by suspending incentives for large-scale agricultural and ranching projects. It also began a plan this month to monitor part of the region by helicopter and fine those found guilty of clearing the forest illegally. Officials handed out $ 9 million in fines in the first 15 days. `` There's a greater awareness of the problem, on the part of the government and individuals, and that will make it easier to protect the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON> said. Ranchers and farmers burn off large tracts of the rain forest to clear land for planting and grazing.

<HEAD>West Germany Prepares For New Wave of East German Refugees</HEAD>

 Officials are preparing for a new wave of East German refugees seeking to flee to the West from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, but denied on Wednesday that a deal was struck to permit a wholesale exodus. Preparations went ahead to set up four tent camps in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> state to house an expected surge of East German refugees after Sept. 1. West German and Hungarian officials say many East German families will have to decide whether to flee to the West or return home by then because it marks the end of the school vacation in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The Stuttgarter Nachrichten newspaper said Austrian and West German rail officials worked out plans for special trains to bring refugees to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Chief government spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said the new refugee facilities are being erected `` because the government must be prepared for all possibilities. We have to take this date of Sept. 1 and the days thereafter seriously.'' West German TV quoted Hungarian Interior Minister <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Horvath </PERSON> as reiterating <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s intention not to return any East Germans against their will and again appealing to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to work to solve the problem. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said officials estimate that from 150,000 to 200,000 East Germans are on vacation in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Officials earlier speculated as many as 20,000 could decide to stay in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. West German news media reported that 15,000 East Germans would be allowed to go the West from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> by the weekend, carrying newly issued West German passports. A high-ranking government official in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied it and said issuing such passports would not solve the problem. `` The new passports do not have a Hungarian entry visa in them and thus could not be used to legally leave the country,'' he said. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said news reports saying that removal of the visa requirement was imminent `` do not correspond to the facts and possibilities.'' In <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, an Austrian government source said the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> is working on a plan to ferry at least 1,500 East Germans from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the next few days. West German officials said negotiations were continuing, but no final arrangement had been concluded. At least 6,000 East Germans are thought to have used vacations in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to flee west to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> began dismantling fortifications along the border in May. The flood of refugees has been fueled by the refusal of the communist East German leadership to adopt economic and political reforms similar to those under way in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general with a long record of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government service, will lead the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team that monitors Nicaraguan elections in February, officials announced Wednesday. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 69, now is in private law practice in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he had no opinions beforehand on the fairness of the elections, but that he has had plenty of experience in hard-fought campaigns. `` I've been a candidate; I've been involved in elections, I once even ran a recount in a gubernatorial election in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> many years ago,'' he remarked in a telephone interview Wednesday night with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking privately, said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government opposed <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s appointment and resisted it for weeks. No one at <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Mission was willing to comment on the appointment. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> is best known for resigning as attorney general in protest during the `` Saturday night massacre'' episode in the Watergate scandal. He quit the night of Oct. 10, 1973, the same night President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> fired Watergate special prosecutor <PERSON> Archibald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>. `` Well, I would like that to be remembered,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> quipped on Wednesday. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and a group of jurists and former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials called the Commission on the Independence of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> just returned from that country, where elections leading to independence from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are set for November. On Tuesday, commission members criticized <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s procedures for the vote <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday that <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> would visit <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> periodically to assess the situation for Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, and would oversee the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer mission.

<HEAD>Tens of Thousands of Teachers Strike for Higher Pay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of teachers began a 48-hour strike Wednesday to back demands for a pay raise that the government says would lead to more inflation. `` In many areas, teachers are paid less then what unemployed people will receive,'' from the government, said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, secretary-general of the 230,000-member Confederation of Argentine Educators. Wages have not kept pace with inflation, she said, and are so low that teachers in many provinces often can not afford bus tickets to get to work. Teachers receive $ 46 a month in base pay, and are demanding a raise to $ 114. The government is trying to hold down wage increases to get a halt inflation that in July soared by 197 percent. The projection for August is 35 percent. Education Minister <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Salonia </PERSON> said a raise for teachers would encourage other unions to make similar demands, and this `` would run the risk of returning to hyperinflation.'' <PERSON> Salonia </PERSON> said striking teachers would be docked pay. Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said 85 pecent of her federation went on strike Wednesday. The goverment gave no estimate. Private schools, including those run by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, remained open, as did many public schools. The job action is the first nationwide strike since President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> took office July 8, and is seen as a test in a growing clash of wills between the government and organized labor. Bus drivers, train conductors, doctors in municipal hospitals and public employees in several provinces all are demanding pay raises. The 3 million member <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> has opposed government concessions to businesses, such as a plan to allow workers to be hired on a temporary basis with no right to severance pay, and refused to rule out a general strike. In an editorial titled `` Changing Times,'' the English-language newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Buenos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aires </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> commented Wednesday: `` By a supreme irony, the government of a labor-based party seems to be on a collision course with the trade unions.''

 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> agreed on a tentative contract for 12,800 telephone workers Wednesday, allowing 37,000 <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> workers in five <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> states to head back to work and leaving <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> the last regional phone company still on strike. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, serving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state and most of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, met with union negotiators Wednesday in their first talks in two weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>'s operators, repair crews and other union employees in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> began returning to work at noon following the agreement with <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION>. Union workers in the five states had said they would stay off the job until settlements were reached in each state. Management employees had assumed the duties of striking workers, but backlogs of service and installation requests developed in some states, as well as some delays in placing directory assistance or operator-assisted calls. The strike at Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> began Aug. 13, one week after strikes began at three other `` Baby Bell'' regional telephone companies, formed after the 1984 breakup of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The strikes had affected nearly 200,000 workers in 20 states. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> workers in six states and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, ended their strike Monday after agreements were reached with Communications Workers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> locals in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. A tentative contract settlement also has been reached at <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION>, which serves <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. But 60,000 workers remained on strike against <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>. Since the strike began Aug. 6, the company and the union had met formally only twice before. Talks resumed with the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION>, representing most of the striking workers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, representing <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> workers. Both sides agreed to continue Thursday. <PERSON> Myles </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvey </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> Local 222 in <LOCATION> Quincy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said issues central to Wednesday's talks with his union in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> were health benefits and the company's fixed liablility medical expense plan, although wages, job safety and job security were also at issue. The original <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> proposal called for workers to contribute $ 10.20 a week for health insurance. <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> reduced that Wednesday to $ 4.50, <PERSON> Calvey </PERSON> said About 90 activists _ roughly half of them striking <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> workers _ marched Wednesday near the summer White House at <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, to urge President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to institute national health care. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, it ai n't fair. We do n't have no health care,'' chanted the marchers, who were not allowed onto the property of the <ORGANIZATION> Shawmut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended a luncheon. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> pact includes changes in employee scheduling rules that give the company greater flexibility and an improved employee profit-sharing plan, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Doman </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s bargaining committee, said at a news conference The three-year pact also includes wage increases and improved health benefits, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Handley </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> bargaining committee, who appeared with <PERSON> Doman </PERSON>. The two would n't discuss details. Late Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> announced a tentative accord on a new three-year pact covering 4,200 striking workers. Tentative settlements were reached over the weekend with <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, and on Monday with <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> signed a tentative agreement Monday with <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION>, but has no agreement with about 9,200 workers represented by the <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION>. The last talks were Tuesday and no new talks are scheduled.

 Jurors acquitted a former Teacher of the Year of marijuana charges Wednesday after her friends testified they believed her claim that she did n't know her husband grew the weed in a vine-covered greenhouse behind their home. `` It was the truth, and they knew it,'' <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> said after jurors reached a verdict in two hours of deliberations. She said she might try to get back her job. `` I am a teacher,'' she added. District Attorney <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said, `` I respect the opinion of the jury _ and that's why we have juries, but I'll continue to prosecute cases where drug squads find marijuana growing in someone's back yard.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON>, who lost her job despite her status as 1989 Teacher of the Year, took the witness stand. `` I'm trying desperately to put my life back together. I'm trying to clear my name,'' she testified. `` My picture was on the front page of the newspaper _ Teacher of the Year charged with marijuana,'' she said. `` I spent two weeks curled up in a fetal position.'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> questioned her about marijuana found in a chest of drawers in the couple's bedroom and about a pipe with drug residue in a washroom chest. `` I trust my husband, and in one thing he betrayed me,'' she said. `` He never told me he would quit. That would have been a lie. He said, ` <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> I'll cut down. <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON>, I wo n't smoke it in your presence.'' Co-workers, members of a theater group and parents from a local Boy Scout troop praised Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON>, 38, as a woman of stellar character who would never lie to her friends about something as serious as marijuana use. `` I know Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> well enough to believe her if she told me anything,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, a teacher who worked with Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Colquitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON>, 1989 Teacher of the Year in <LOCATION> Colquitt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, was charged with growing and possessing marijuana and could receive 11 years in prison and $ 1,000 in fines if convicted. The chemistry teacher was fired after her arrest last spring. Her husband, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON>, 39, has admitted chronic marijuana use and testified Tuesday his wife never grew or smoked the stuff. `` If she had known that I had planted marijuana in that yard, that would have been it,'' he said. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON>, a former teacher and lawyer, said he hid his marijuana use from his wife because it had been `` a bone of contention'' throughout their 16-year marriage. He testified he built the greenhouse at their rural home while his wife and two sons were out of town and covered it with vines to conceal it. The Sherlings were arrested May 19 at their home, where police acting on a tip said they found 22 marijuana plants in the greenhouse. Police said they also found marijuana seeds and drug paraphernalia. Sherling pleaded guilty to drug charges and is scheduled to be sentenced this week. Jurors were brought in by bus from <LOCATION> Valdosta </LOCATION> to hear Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON>'s case after defense attorneys contended she could not be tried fairly by jurors from the <LOCATION> Moultrie </LOCATION> area.

 Authorities imposed curfews Wednesday on <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and nine other cities in the heart of cocaine country in an effort to curb violence by drug barons stung by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s crackdown on narcotics. Also Wednesday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government ordered families of its embassy staff to leave <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, a spokesman said. The order apparently was given because of fears of attacks by drug traffickers. It would apply to about 50 relatives of embassy staff, the source said on condition of anonymity. Embassy officials also recommended that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> leave. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> began urging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tourists to bypass <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. A shipment of weapons bound for <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> was intercepted, and authorities said three more judges resigned in the city that reputedly supplies the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with 80 percent of its cocaine. More than 100 judges have resigned since drug traffickers vowed to retaliate for a crackdown on drug trafficking. The curfews imposed Wednesday by Interior Minister <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> affect a total of about 3 million people. He said the mayors of the municipalities under the curfew have broader powers to conduct searches, inspect vehicles and arrest suspects. <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said the curfew is in effect from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. for all vehicles and pedestrians, will remain in effect indefinitely in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, `` until the nights in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> quiet down.'' The industrial city of about 2 million people, 215 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, is home to the world's largest cocaine cartel. <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> has suffered almost daily bombings by the traffickers, who are pressing the government to end its 12-day-old campaign and negotiate a peace. In a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> news conference broadcast by the national radio chain <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said there would be no exceptions to the curfew. `` We will not give safe conduct passes,'' he said. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> complained of a lack of security assistance from the national government. He has asked for 3,000 additional national police officers to bolster the existing force of 4,000. He said the government agreed to provide an extra 100. The mayor favors talks with the traffickers, but said at the news conference that the suggestion had been rejected by the government, and that he was carrying out all anti-narcotics measures ordered by national authorities. Communications Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonds </PERSON> said on Tuesday, `` There will be no dialogue.'' At midday, Mayor <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> anounced an identical curfew in the town of <LOCATION> Itagui </LOCATION>, 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> ordered the curfew extended to eight other communities near <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. They are <PERSON> Bello </PERSON>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estrella </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Envigado </ORGANIZATION>, Sabaneta, <LOCATION> Rionegro </LOCATION>, Copabacana, <PERSON> Guarne </PERSON> and Caldas. `` <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> has become a center of perturbation in the country,'' <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> told reporters. On Tuesday night, police in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> interrupted an attempt to rocket a state-owned distillery in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. Since the government launched its offensive and drug barons responded with a declaration of war, the city and surrounding communities have been rocked by at least 17 bombings and three arson attacks, according to police reports. In the city of <LOCATION> Pereira </LOCATION>, 110 miles west of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, police frustrated an attempt to kill the mayor and a city councilman, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Caracol </PERSON> said an armed suspect was arrested in the city hall, but said the motives for the attempt remain unclear. There was no immediate indication whether it was related to trafficking. The report said <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> Jairo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arango </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> and councilman <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Velez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Corral </PERSON> had been the target of frequent death threats. It said security had been boosted for both men. National police said they intercepted an arms shipment apparently bound for <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. A spokesman said the weapons, including 169 grenades for use with a launcher, 40 fragmentation grenades and 600 firearms cartridges were found in a truck carrying foodstuffs, which stopped on <LOCATION> Bogota-Medellin </LOCATION> highway at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorada </LOCATION>, 75 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. The government crackdown was sparked by a 48-hour wave of assassinations, capped by the slaying of a highly popular presidential candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, on Aug. 18. Hundreds of homes, office buildings and other properties owned by traffikers have been impounded along with cars, aircraft, yachts and other goods. The army estimates the value of the property at more than $ 200 million. Several midlevel trafficking suspects have been arrested. According to local newspaper and radio reports confirmed by a judge's assistant Wednesday, three <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> judges investigating assassinations resigned because of death threats. The reports said two of them are believed to have fled the country. The assassinations under investigation were those of national police Col. <PERSON> Waldemar </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, Judge <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and the governor of <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Roldan </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON>. All three killings are blamed on traffickers. A total of 108 judges have resigned since the government's offensive began, mostly in protest over what they feel is a lack of adequate security, according to the national judicial employes' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has been rejecting the resignations and ordering the judges to resume their duties. Since 1981, 220 judges, magistrates and judicial aides have been killed in the traffickers' highly successful campaign to cow the courts and avoid proscution.

 A man who spent 18 months behind bars for having oral sex with his wife was freed Wednesday by a judge who said prosecutors would have to come up with a better reason for putting him in prison. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>, a 35-year-old carpenter believed to be the first man convicted under <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s 156-year-old sodomy law for conduct between marriage partners, was released from the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>, who had been sentenced to five years in prison, waved to waiting reporters as he left in a private car. `` Sure, I'm bitter,'' he said later at a news conference at the headquarters of the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. But he said faith in humanity kept his spirits up. `` I knew someone would see this thing as it really was,'' he said. <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> said the first thing he would do is contact the carpenters' union about a job. He said he hoped to see his sons, although he does not have visitation rights. He said a lengthy domestic dispute resulted in his now-former wife claiming falsely that he used force to have sex with her. `` I only did what she wanted me to do, and then she used it against me to get custody of the kids,'' <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> was charged with rape, aggravated oral sodomy and aggravated anal sodomy over two encounters with <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, his common-law wife of four years. Aggravated sodomy constitutes oral or anal sex without consent. <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> was acquitted of those charges, but a jury found him guilty of sodomy without aggravation, or oral or anal sex with consent, because he admitted on the stand that he had had oral sex with Ms. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. Sodomy, even between a consenting husband and wife, is a felony in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellani </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> freed, noting that he was found guilty `` only of an act involving an act between two married adults.'' He said <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> must be freed on his own recognizance unless the state could find a reason to hold him. <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lawyer, told the judge that the prosecutors should disqualify themselves if they ever had engaged in oral sex. `` We can not have a ` do as I say not as I do' syndrome,'' he argued. The judge rejected the motion without comment. <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> also argued that the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> law violates constitutional rights to privacy. But <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON>, a senior assistant attorney general representing the state, said privacy was not at issue. `` It's not a matter of police peeking in windows. That's not what is before this court,'' she said. She said the state became involved because Ms. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> complained to authorities. The couple, who had two children, have since divorced.

 A court ruled Wednesday that <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> may be extradited to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to face charges that as a Nazi camp commander he personally killed dozens of people at forced labor camps in World War II. However, the 77-year-old <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> may appeal the ruling of the federal appeals court to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and thus stave off immediate extradition to <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Frankly, <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> is not a young man ... We're concerned that the final appeal not take as long'' as the initial proceedings, said Rabbi <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hier </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for Holocaust Studies. <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> was discovered living in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in November 1987 and has been held in jail ever since in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plata </LOCATION>, 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. He is being kept in a hospital at the penal center because of his age and ill health, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> reported. A <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> court issued an order for <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON>'s arrest in 1973. He is accused of being responsible for the deaths of at least 5,000 people, mostly Jews, at two labor camps he commanded in occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` We have witnesses that say he threw men, women and children alive into bonfires,'' said <PERSON> Hier </PERSON>. `` He smashed children into walls and then set dogs on them to tear them apart.'' Defense attorneys have asked Argentine authorities to deny the extradition request, or to hold any trial in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. They have five days to appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hier </PERSON> said the French army arrested <PERSON> Schwammberger </PERSON> in 1945, but he escaped on Jan. 1, 1948. He came to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in 1949, was naturalized as a citizen in 1953 and was granted full citizenship in 1965. Argentine officials said he lived in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plata </LOCATION> and worked for a chemical company for many years.

 Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, the only daughter of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, and husband <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> are separating, his father said Wednesday. A television report said they will divorce. A Buckingham Palace press officer refused to comment on the reports but said a palace announcement would be issued Thursday morning. Maj. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> in a statement said: `` For the moment they are going to live separately. They are not going to divorce but will be separating.'' It added: `` They will not be living far away from each other. Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> will remain at <LOCATION> Gatcombe </LOCATION> -LRB- Park, the family home in western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> -RRB- and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> will be moving about two miles away.'' The statement said this would happen `` in the near future.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said the palace would issue a statement saying the couple, who have been married 15 years and have two children, would divorce. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, 39, was attending an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> Wednesday. Her 40-year-old husband, an ex-Army captain, was at home at <LOCATION> Gatcombe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. The princess, who is the head of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equestrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, was in private meetings in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> all day. She was rarely seen and two bodyguards kept reporters at bay at all times. Telephone calls to her room at the Caribe Hilton hotel were automatically deflected to switchboard operators, who would not allow calls through. Rumors of trouble in the marriage have circulated since 1981, and in recent years the princess and her husband have spent periods of up to six months apart. She has become one of the busiest members of the royal family as president of the Save the Children Fund, a charity that works on behalf of poor children around the world. Her husband has traveled widely for business and equestrian interests. Speculation that their marriage was in trouble arose most recently in April after letters written to <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> by an aide to the queen were stolen and sent to the tabloid The Sun. The Sun, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s biggest circulation newspaper, did not disclose the content of the four letters and said it gave them to police. Buckingham Palace then identified <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON>, a 35-year-old bachelor, as the writer in a bid to stop intense news media speculation. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> told reporters at that time that his marriage was `` fine and happy.'' On Aug. 23, the queen personally awarded <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> the Royal Victorian Order as he left her personal service after three years as her aide to take command of a frigate. The citation said the order was awarded for `` extraordinary, important or personal services to the sovereign or the royal family.'' <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s aunt, Princess <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, the queen's only sister, was divorced in 1978 from Lord <PERSON> Snowdon </PERSON>, who has since remarried. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> is sixth in line to the throne.

 An empty 600-gallon fuel tank fell from a fighter jet north of a popular beach resort Wednesday, authorities said. There were no injuries or property damage when the 15-foot, 500-pound tank dropped from an F-4 Phantom jet near <LOCATION> Rehoboth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, said Capt. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Dover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> spokesman.

<TEXT>
 Two buses loaded with passengers and driven by soldiers pressed into service during a bus strike collided on an expressway, killing 20 people, police said Wednesday. More than 30 people were injured. The head-on collision occurred at 7 p.m. Tuesday about four miles from the center of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> on the main artery connecting the southern suburbs with the downtown, police said. Witnesses said the buses were packed with passengers returning home from work. Published reports Wednesday quoted witnesses who said they saw one bus swerve to avoid a child running across the road. Police had no comment on whether lack of experience on the part of the drivers figured in the accident. The buses belonged to the state-owned transportation company <LOCATION> ENATRU </LOCATION>, whose drivers struck last week demanding higher wages. Company officials said members of the armed forces were ordered in to drive the buses during the strike. The strike is one of many plaguing <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. Strikes by miners, teachers, and electrical and telephone workers recently created a state of chaos throughout the country. Many of the injured had to be taken to police and military hospitals because a three-month strike by public doctors has left many hospitals and emergency rooms unattended. Hospitals treating the casualties appealed for blood donations Tuesday night as supplies ran short due to the number and severity of the injuries. Most of the strikes are for higher wages to offset the effects of hyperinflation now ravaging <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s economy. Analysts expect inflation to pass 5,000 percent this year.

 A newly merged Lutheran denomination ended its first national assembly Wednesday with resolutions on social and political concerns, including <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, striking coal miners and hunger. In addition to resolutions urging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and backing the Appalachian miners, delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> meeting approved a measure accusing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of abusing Palestinians. The nation's fourth-largest <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denomination also urged participation in a `` Burger-A-Month'' campaign, in which each person gives $ 2 a month _ the approximate cost of a hamburger _ to alleviate world hunger. About 1,040, delegates representing 5.3 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Lutherans expressed special support for small rural and urban congregations on the eighth and final day of their meeting in this <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb. In a `` throwaway society'' where `` new is valued more than old and bigger is often seen as better,'' rural communities are in economic crisis and inner cities suffer `` blight, poverty'' and flight of businesses, the resolution said. The assembly called for vigorous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to determine the fate of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prisoners of war and those missing in action in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and encouraged Lutherans to be alert to advances in science and technology. `` We must learn'' from science, said the Rev. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenning </PERSON> of Independence, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the assembly said achieving peace required ending abuses against Palestinians, but also stressed security for the Jewish state and confessed past `` sinful complicity as Lutherans'' against Jews. The miners backed by the Lutherans have been on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> since April 5. The assembly was the first since the January 1988 merger of the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>. `` It demonstrated that it is right for us to be together. There was 100 percent enthusiasim, a marvelous identification of us as a church,'' Bishop <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chilstrom </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, president of the denomination, told a post-meeting news conference. <PERSON> Chilstrom </PERSON> said the assembly's decision to join the major <PERSON> Chrisitian </PERSON> ecumenical bodies, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, were `` signs of great maturity.'' He said he was impressed by the diversity of the delegates. In addition to whites, there were blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>. Nearly half the delegates were women. <PERSON> Chilstrom </PERSON> noted that the mainly white church was established with a mandate to include people of different cultures. `` We've got a long way to go, but we're on the way,'' he said. Asked about the church's budget crunch, he predicted a turnaround in congregational contributions because of the `` Mission 90'' program adopted here. `` It takes a long time to turn around a ship as big as the <ORGANIZATION> ELCA </ORGANIZATION>, but it's going to turn around,'' <PERSON> Chilstrom </PERSON> said. `` Mission 90,'' a new long-range program for the 1990s, emphasizes Bible teaching, evangelism, tithing and work for peace, justice, and the environment. Following one of the most heated debates of the assembly, the delegates earlier set a Sept. 1, 1991, deadline for the church pension board to sell all shares in companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Those investments are valued at $ 84.9 million. `` Seting a date to be completely divested could be a problem for the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pensions </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Chilstrom </PERSON> said. However, he said all delegates agreed that apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racial system of government, must be dismantled. Another divisive issue was abortion. The assembly on Monday approved a resolution some interpreted as pro-choice, then reconsidered and decided to remain neutral on abortion pending a two-year study. The next assembly is in 1991.

<TEXT>
 Tenor <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> canceled this season's appearance with the Lyric Opera of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and was told in return Wednesday that he's no longer welcome to perform with the company The famed singer's manager, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON>, told the Lyric that a persistent inflammation of <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>'s sciatic nerve prevents him from performing in a live opera at this time, the company said in a news release. The Lyric, which is entering its 35th anniversary season with the house 99 percent sold out, said the singer canceled 26 of the 41 performances he was under contract to do for the company this decade. `` That's quite a record!'' said Lyric General Director <PERSON> Ardis </PERSON> <PERSON> Krainik </PERSON>. `` Lyric Opera is now unwilling to take the risk of one more cancellation by Mr. <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>,'' she said. Miss <PERSON> Krainik </PERSON> said the Lyric is not interested in considering any other future engagements with <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>, and has withdrawn from negotiations for performances in 1991. She said the tenor has had a growing reputation for cancellations. In May with the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> walked off the stage when his voice cracked during the third act of <PERSON> Puccini </PERSON>'s `` Tosca.'' Asked if there was any reason to think his cancellation in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> was motivated by something other than health, Miss <PERSON> Krainik </PERSON> said, `` That's not the point. The point is, he canceled She said she felt that with his record of cancellations, she had no choice but to sever ties with the singer, who first performed with the Lyric in 1973. <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> have the greatest respect for the Lyric and Miss <PERSON> Krainik </PERSON>. But the manager said he believes she is acting `` a little bit irrational,'' particularly since <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> has been the greatest fund raiser in the Lyric's history. `` I think she gets the impression that he is doing this out of some kind of spite for the Lyric Opera of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which is absolutely wrong,'' <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> had been scheduled to perform in `` Tosca'' on six dates in late September and early October. Neither the Lyric nor <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON> would discuss the singer's fees.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> filed a $ 10 million libel lawsuit Wednesday against game show host and animal rights activist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> and others. The lawsuit contends that <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> and animal rights organizations have conducted a two-year `` vendetta'' against the association and its <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> regional director, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, said association attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Langberg </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> also is a plaintiff in the lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` From the standpoint from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> this was a very reluctant suit,'' said <PERSON> Langberg </PERSON>. `` They did not want to sue <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>. They want to devote their energies to protecting animals.'' The lawsuit accuses <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Activists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> and its executive director, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnet </PERSON>, of libel, slander, trade libel, interference with prospective business relations, conspiracy and false-light invasion of privacy, said <PERSON> Langberg </PERSON>. `` I have no legal background but I believe that to be sued for these things the statements I made had to be untrue. And of course, they were not,'' <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said in response to the lawsuit. Telephone calls seeking comment from Ms. <PERSON> Burnet </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Activists </ORGANIZATION> were met with repeated busy signals. A separate claim was filed against the city and <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>. Rush for allegedly assisting <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> in the campaign, <PERSON> Langberg </PERSON> said. `` I have n't even seen it,'' said <PERSON> Rush </PERSON>, `` but the conduct of this office in the past has been beyond <LOCATION> reproach </LOCATION> and it is currently beyond reproach. The claim will be discussed with the city attorney and a response will be made.'' <PERSON> Langberg </PERSON> said the lawsuit charges that <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, on radio, accused Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and the association of condoning animal cruelty. The association was founded in 1877 for the protection of animals and children, and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> regional office has been active in protecting animals used in the entertainment industry. <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, longtime host of the television game show `` The Price Is Right,'' has been involved with animal rights for many years and in 1987 quit after 19 years as host of the Miss USA Pageant because contestants wore fur coats. He was the 1987 winner of the highest award given by directors of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. `` I have never been sued but I'm sure it's a very unpleasant experience. It has to be expensive and it has to be time-consuming,'' <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said. `` But if this suit results in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public becoming more aware of the extent of animal cruelty in entertainment then the suit will have served a very valuable purpose and it will be well worth the money and the time it costs me.''

 The former director of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s largest copper mine is among 20 people arrested in an investigation into mismanagement of the bankrupt state enterprise, officials said Wednesday. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortigosa </PERSON>, spokesman for the federal attorney general's office, said <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arenal </PERSON>, director of the Cananea mine until last March, appeared before a judge Wednesday night to testify. <PERSON> Ortigosa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> would be jailed afterward. `` Other people implicated are being investigated,'' <PERSON> Ortigosa </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone. `` Twenty have been detained.'' The attorney general's office said the government was investigating `` a series of possibly fraudulent acts, embezzlement and other illicit acts the company suffered and attributable to diverse people from 1983 to 1988.'' No charges has been filed. It said the government obtained statements from employees at the bankrupt mine that accused <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> of receiving undeclared commissions on foreign sales of copper. The mine was declared bankrupt Aug. 20, throwing 3,200 miners out of work. The federal government, a 90 percent owner in the open-pit operation, sent 3,000 soldiers to close the mine site, 25 miles south of the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> border. The soliders were later withdrawn. The closing came one week before the miners had scheduled a strike to pressure for their demands representing a 330 percent wage-and-benefit increase. The government is seeking a buyer for the operation. Miners and politicians have called for an investigation of the union's management to determine how the company became insolvent. The Excelsior news service said <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> is son-in-law of former President <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Echeverria </PERSON>, who served from 1970 to 1976.

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Wednesday he will go to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to take part in ceremonies this week marking 20 years of power for the leader of that radical North African Arab country, Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> made the announcement in this city 60 miles north of the capital at a ceremony handing over 230 property deeds to 508 peasant families. `` We are willing to have good relations with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and also with <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. He said that if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president invited him to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` I would go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to meet with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he would proceed from the Saturday ceremonies in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> to take part in the four-day summit of non-aligned nations, which ends Monday. The president also said that to date his government has freed from prison 283 peasants who were accused of supporting the rebels, known as Contras. `` There are still 1,129 counterrevolutionaries in prison who were counted by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'' last week, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. The president emphasized that the government will free the others, but did not say when. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the U.S.-backed Contras, 11,000 of whom are in camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, have kidnapped 7,478 people. He demanded that `` the counterrevolutionaries hand over the kidnap victims'' who are still alive. He said that when the Contras hand over their arms `` we are willing to receive them like brothers.'' The government has announced a general amnesty for Contras who return to participate in Nicaraguan life. `` But those who do not accept the friendly hand we are extending, we will give them our fists until we crush them.'' In a statement in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said two Sandinista soldiers were killed when rebels blew up a truck carrying soldiers in the town of <LOCATION> Mongallo </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast on Tuesday.

 Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> opened his first official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit Wednesday with an impromptu news conference in which he said he will be discussing trade issues this week with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> turned what was supposed to be a 10-minute stop at the Japanese Cultural Center into a half-hour lunch visit at which he fielded questions from reporters. Asked about the purpose of his visit, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said: `` I want to make rock-solid the relationship between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Another questioner raised the issue of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s $ 55 billion annual trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I plan to talk about this with the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said through an interpreter. `` We will be continuing the dialogue.''

A senior <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> who briefed reporters before the trip said that <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> is not bringing major trade or diplomatic initiatives. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, 58, took office on Aug. 9 after the resignation of Prime Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, whose money-for-sex affairs with geisha and cabaret hostesses contributed to a major defeat for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in elections in the upper house of parliament last month. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> planned to meet with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Friday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and also make stops in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> during his 10-day trip with his wife, <PERSON> Sachiyo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> told the crowd at the cultural center he had fond memories of his first visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 27 years ago, when he rented a car and drove along the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s itinerary was to take him Thursday to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Saturday to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, Monday to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Wednesday to <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> and Friday to <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Don't Hold Your Breath for Democratic Government in Panama</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A democratically elected government was supposed to take power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> tomorrow. But as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, do n't hold your breath. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he sees no sign that strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will yield power voluntarily. The <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> knot is as tangled as ever, on the eve of what was supposed to be a transfer of power to a new elected president. There is n't any, because the regime <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> dominates as commander in chief decreed that the elections his side lost were not going to count. The Organization of American States spent the summer trying to mediate a path to democratic government. All it managed to do was produce a statement expressing concern that its mission had not succeeded, and urging Panamanians to work out their differences themselves. When that was attempted in a May 7 election, and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime apparently lost, his government simply annulled the election returns after the fact. For good measure, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s paramilitary supporters beat opposition candidates bloody when they staged a protest march. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> then tried its hand, rebuking <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and sending emissaries to seek a peaceful transition to democratic rule, in time for the Sept. 1 inauguration date set by the Panamanian constitution. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s side offered to share power in a provisional government, with the general still holding his command, but the opposition rejected that deal. That left no deal. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out. It also wants to put him on trial for drug trafficking under two indictments returned in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in February 1988. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations have been trying to dislodge him ever since, imposing economic sanctions, withholding <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> revenues, and helping to finance the opposition campaign for the abortive elections last spring. But <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remains commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, and that hold on power does not seem to have been shaken. `` I'm not holding my breath on his voluntary departure,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a mid-August news conference. The long stalemate is a case study in the uses and constraints on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> power in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, even in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where some 13,000 American troops are stationed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> described those limits when he said there would be no unilateral use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to deal with the drug crisis in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. `` I know enough about this hemisphere, and I've had enough experience in dealing with countries in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, all through the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> _ to know the constraints that exist in terms of _ or should exist in terms of dispatching troops,'' he said at a news conference on Aug. 23. Those constraints apply in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, too. Playing on Latin American sensitivities, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> constantly complains that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is intervening, interfering and bent on rescinding the treaties under which <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will take over the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> in 1999. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mediation team criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for conducting military maneuvers in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> this summer, saying that had a `` negative effect'' on its effort to negotiate a transfer of power. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said other <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> nations should join in isolating the Noriega-backed government that apparently will continue in power. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> called it an `` outlaw regime.'' <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is allied with cocaine traffickers in aggression `` as surely as <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> 50 years ago was aggression.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has left open the possibility that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might somehow be seized if he is not extradited. `` We have an indictment out against Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for drug trafficking,'' he said on Aug. 15. `` I'm told that it's a good indictment. `` I'm not saying what I would do or would n't do. ... I have an obligation to try to bring people to justice.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` will continue to support what the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> voted for'' in their aborted election. The question is how. The president's most recent answer was that he did n't know for sure. Pressure for tougher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action is certain to increase, in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere. There already are proposals in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to suspend or abrogate the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties. The administration reportedly is considering stiffened economic sanctions. And there is always military option. Sol <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Linowitz </PERSON>, who negotiated the canal treaties, says <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mediation remains the right course. `` To date the negotiating efforts of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> have been proceeding fitfully, but the reports from the negotiating table give some reason for hope. ...'' he wrote in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. He said that effort should get more time. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has made a good start toward addressing the crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by encouraging a regional diplomatic solution,'' <PERSON> Linowitz </PERSON> wrote. `` We should stick with it.''

His 20-year-old son, <PERSON> Mohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tewani </PERSON>, runs the <ORGANIZATION> Madre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> No. 1, featuring high-fashion costume jewelry, just a few blocks down the same street. More than 90 percent of their business comes from Mexicans who survey the retail selections before making their own large wholesale purchases, say the Tewanis and other Indian merchants on Juarez and <LOCATION> Zaragoza </LOCATION> streets. They say they found success in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> and spread the word to other Indians. Many of the Mexican customers smuggle the goods into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to get by their country's tariffs and trade restrictions, the Indian merchants say. Mayor <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatangelo </PERSON>, a retailer, remembers a wave of Indians `` just coming and coming and coming'' in the early 1980s to set up a gold trade. `` I call it the ` Gold City,' because there's so much gold in there. The Indians are good in jewelry. It's very important to them, and they've got good connections with the factories in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.'' Tatangelo estimated that jewelry stores, now dominated by <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, sell as much as $ 500 million in gold to Mexicans shopping in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>. Others have moved into other lines, including cheaper jewelry, electronics and clothing. As a result, more than a few Indians live in the fashionable Del Mar `` C'' and Regency Park neighborhoods on the city's north side. While the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> immigrants have adapted to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Mexican cultures, there is also an effort to preserve some of their roots. The <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laredo </ORGANIZATION>'s 33 families meet regularly for a dose of culture. On Sunday, Aug. 13, they met at <PERSON> Ramesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tewani </PERSON>'s house for a `` katha'' or thanksgiving prayer session Afterwards, they raised the Indian flag to celebrate <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s independence day. A letter sent to members, written in English, concluded with the message: `` Viva. Indian Independence.'' Association President <PERSON> Kishin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rupani </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Dayasons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Costume </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewelry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gifts, said the group helps maintain a close-knit community. Indian singers and entertainers touring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sometimes are paid to make side trips to perform at members' homes. The association usually meets at homes because there is no Indian temple or movie theater. As with most immigrants, however, identification with the new country increases with the time here, particularly among the young. <PERSON> Mohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tewani </PERSON> has a shrine in the back of his store, but is unsure of the names of Hindu gods revered there. `` My father would be the expert on that.'' Command of the various native languages also is weakening. `` Ultimately, they have to blend in with the society,'' said <PERSON> Rupani </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Soma </PERSON>, a banking and finance major at <ORGANIZATION> Laredo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` Actually, we are Americanized in a way, but we're more conservative with dating and things like that,'' said <PERSON> Soma </PERSON> <PERSON> Rupani </PERSON>, 21. `` You've heard of the arranged marriages? You have to stay within your community.'' Some parents still arrange their children's marriages, she said, but even that institution has been liberalized by time in a new country. Twenty-six years ago, <PERSON> Rupani </PERSON> did n't meet <PERSON> Soma </PERSON>'s mother until they were engaged. Today, `` I will know the guy, but the one they approve of is the one I will marry,'' said <PERSON> Soma </PERSON> <PERSON> Rupani </PERSON>. `` That's how we have changed a little.'' <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lakhiani </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> four years ago after nearly being killed by an armed robber in his former shop in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Nearly every square inch of his small store, <LOCATION> Casa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hari </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, is packed with of plastic necklaces, earrings, scarves, gold-filled jewelry, perfumes, sunglasses, clocks, purses and other merchandise destined primarily for south of the border. <PERSON> Lakhiani </PERSON>, originally from <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, said his three children `` do n't recognize Indian culture'' but he does n't care `` It's good to be aware of roots, but you have to adapt, you have to blend in,'' he said as a radio behind the counter played music from a station broadcasting from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.

 Actress <PERSON> Lauralee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> visited rape treatment centers and talked to counselors before starting a summer-long story about date rape on the CBS daytime serial `` The Young and the Restless.'' The story followed the rape of her character, fashion model Cricket Blair, by her boyfriend played by <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Olandt </PERSON>, and his subsequent trial. `` We've just finished the trial and the jury was about to turn him loose when my brother found another girl he had raped on a college campus,'' said <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, 20. `` The judge allowed us to bring in the new witness. I just got a script where I tell the college officials that if they'd listened to her I would n't have been raped.'' The trial ended last week with his conviction on a charge of rape. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> went to the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Violence Against Women and treatment centers, where she talked to rape victims and counselors. `` This is a good story to do in the summer when a lot of students are home,'' said <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>. `` The people I talked to said the incidence of date rape on college campuses is going up and up. I was just on a personal appearance in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> where two women told me they had friends who reported rapes after seeing our show.'' She said the boyfriend in the show gave little indication that he would attack her. `` He was the handsome All-American boy,'' she said. `` He was always looking after me. You'd never suspect. The only sign was that he was a touchy-feely kind of person. `` We've stressed that you should learn about a person. And when you go on a date set your limits right away. We've tried to make it realistic so girls will know what to expect if it should happen to them.'' `` The Young and the Restless,'' the top-rated daytime soap opera, does a major story aimed at young people every summer. In past years they've done stories on alcoholism, teen-age pregnancy and AIDS. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> has gone through a lot of trauma in her time on `` The Young and the Restless.'' Her character's mother has AIDS and earlier this year she learned her fiance is actually her brother and his father is actually her father. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, whose own father is the boss of the top-rated soap opera, has been with the show full time for the past two years. She made her first appearance at 9 and at 13 began making regular appearances as Cricket whenever she had time off from school. `` The audience liked it because they'd never seen someone so young grow up on a show before,'' said <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>. `` I became a teen model for the cosmetics company that's the focus of the show. The children of viewers could watch me and get tips on makeup. The message was do n't overdo your makeup, but I did n't buy that myself. I went through the makeup phase, too.'' Her father is <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, who is executive producer and co-creator with her mother, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>. They're also the creators of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Bold and the Beautiful.'' One brother, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, is a writer for `` The Bold and The Beautiful.'' Another brother, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>, is in charge of finances for both shows. <PERSON> Lauralee </PERSON> still lives at home with her parents. In fact, all of the family lives in a large compound in the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. The Bells moved here only a few years ago after writing and producing the show from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` It was great that my father was the producer. But you have to work twice as hard,'' <PERSON> Lauralee </PERSON> says. `` People expect you to come in and be this obnoxious little thing. I never complained about my work schedule, I never complained about my hair or makeup. I worked hard to prove myself. I do n't run to my father and I do n't carry tales. My parents never come on the set when I'm working.''

 It looks as though there is plenty of reason for optimism heading into the traditional `` business New Year'' at Labor Day, 1989. The holiday was established 95 years ago as a national event honoring working people _ a special moment of respite from toil. But over the decades it also has evolved into a time for planning and launching new efforts toward progress and achievement, a rolling up of sleeves and getting back to work after the diversions of summer. By most accounts, the circumstances that prevail heading into the last four months of 1989 are about as favorable as they ever get in any piece of machinery as diverse and complex as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. There has n't been a recession in nearly seven years and predictions of the likely time of the next downturn have lately been pushed back again. Revised figures issued by the government this week showed the economy growing at a 2.7 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the second quarter of the year _ up from an earlier estimate of 1.7 percent. Faced with that kind of evidence, fears have been fading fast that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign to restrain inflation would result in any sort of severe business slump. The inflation-fighting mission appears, meanwhile, to have met with at least some short-term success. The consumer price index rose at a 0.2 percent annual rate in both June and July, half the pace it set over the previous five months. The producer price index of finished goods, which provides a measure of subsurface inflationary pressures, has been falling recently, as have prices of most raw commodities. There was no widespread drought this year, as there was in 1988, to put pressure on supplies and prices of farm products. World oil prices have n't made any menacing moves of late. `` Economic data released during July and August suggest that the economy is in a phase of disinflationary growth, a combination of rising growth and declining inflation that typically occurs during periods of economic recoveries,'' observed <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Vignola </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, analysts at the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Sensitive economic indicators all point to a strengthening economy.'' Along with its benefits, however, that prospect poses some problems. If the economy is going to keep chugging along, the chances would logically be reduced for a further decline in interest rates. That, in turn, would stand as a setback for many of the numerous people and businesses carrying heavy debt burdens these days, as well as for those who hoped cheaper mortgages would help them buy or sell a house. A stronger economy also would imply that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might go back to restrictive inflation-fighting after a recent period of stimulating the banking system with a shot of anti-recession medicine. Nevertheless, many analysts say, it is worth remembering that through most of the 1980s the American economy has tended to reward the optimists while punishing those who bet on bad times. `` The economy got off to a good start for the current quarter,'' stated <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Boltz </PERSON>, financial economist at the investment management firm <ORGANIZATION> T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rowe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. `` If July is any indication, the likelihood of a recession looks small this year. `` To be sure, a boom does not look in prospect either. But a soft landing followed by a slow takeoff should keep <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> policymakers satisfied.''

<HEAD>When Buying Foreign Real Estate Don't Expect A Shangri-La</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowell </PERSON> and his family were hooked on the pristine beaches, lush tropics and spectacular sunsets of <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>, and nine years ago they did what most vacationers only dream about: they set up house there. But their $ 60,000 one-bedroom waterfront condominium `` off the beaten path,'' was anything but paradise. `` We were uncomfortable with some of the aspects of living in <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> that tourists would n't necessarily be aware of,'' said <PERSON> Cowell </PERSON>, an advertising executive from <LOCATION> Guilford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` It was a lot more crowded than we thought ... there were social problems... and high taxes. Many others intoxicated by an idyllic overseas stay this summer could end up as unhappy as the <ORGANIZATION> Cowells </ORGANIZATION> _ who've since sold their <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> condo for one elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. International real estate experts and vacationers-turned-property owners warn all potential buyers to use their heads, not their emotions when making such foreign investments. `` You have to do your research,'' said <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Begg </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Begg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> real estate firm with listings in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cowell </PERSON> used his experience to set up Island Properties Report, a monthly research publication that provides tips on buying real estate in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and lists available property. The publication costs $ 2 a copy; a sample copy is free. For the more adventurous, the Key Largo, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, publication Private Islands Unlimited provides a listing of islands for sale around the world, ranging from a small undeveloped isle off <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION> selling for $ 15,000 to full-scale resorts for around $ 10 million. The annual fee is $ 25. Wherever you might be looking, do n't expect many bargains. `` The world has become small enough so that people do n't get the bargains they used to get,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Begg </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, especially, real estate has appreciated at about the same staggering rate as with many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> properties. A home in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Docklands section, near the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which cost around $ 20,000 20 years ago now fetches more than 10 times that price. `` <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is out of sight,'' added Mrs. <PERSON> Begg </PERSON>, noting that a flat in that city is just as expensive as in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` You might be able to get good deals in un-chic places.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Begg </PERSON> recommends that those seriously considering buying vacation property abroad spend as much time in that country as they can, particularly in the off season, to get a feel for local life and to check out essentials like water availability. Renting first is also suggested. Each country has its own restrictions and laws that should be reviewed with a local attorney. Some, such as <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, do n't allow foreigners to take profits from the sale of their property out of the country. Others, like <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, prevent outsiders from actually owning land near the coast or the border. In the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, many countries impose a `` foreign purchase'' or `` alien landowners'' tax of about 10 percent of the purchase price when you buy and 8 percent when you sell. Foreign banks also have their own set of restrictions, and most wo n't give you a mortgage, experts say. While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks will provide money for foreign home purchases, most prefer a hefty down payment of around 30 percent to 50 percent, they say. Experts say a home-equity loan may be the best way to finance a second home overseas. Like second-home mortgages, the interest is deductable no matter where you buy, providing the value of your primary and secondary homes do n't exceed $ 1.1 million, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON>, managing director for <ORGANIZATION> Kenneth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leventhal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> accounting firm specializing in real estate. But he warns that to receive a full deduction you can only borrow $ 100,000 above the value of your existing mortgage. To help offset expenses some people rent out their foreign properties. However, <PERSON> Cowell </PERSON> warns you should be prepared to share part of that income with the locals you'll have to hire to clean or manage the property. You also should be prepared for delays, whether in closing the deal or renovating property. `` In many countries time is not of the essence,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, publisher of Private Islands Unlimited. `` Building supplies may also be limited.'' <PERSON> Fern </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomerantz </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, who subscribes to <PERSON> Cowell </PERSON>'s Island Properties Report, can vouch for that She recently wrote in the newsletter that it took 1 -LCB- years to build a house on property she bought in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kitts </LOCATION>, and even after it was completed she had to put up with a few minor inconveniences. `` The surprise of discovering 20 cows outside our window each morning ... -LRB- necessitated -RRB- the immediate construction of a fence,'' she said.

<HEAD>Trustful Religious Settings Are Fertile Field for Crooks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Trust is a basic attitude of religious people, who also stress open acceptance of strangers. These traits make them particularly vulnerable to swindlers. That's the thrust of a report by the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> and the Council of Better Business Bureaus. Based on a survey of cases from state securities agencies, the report finds `` an alarming increase in the number of investment schemes peddled to religious people.'' `` Organizers of such swindles appeal to the high level of trust often found in religious groups and communities.'' Titled `` Preying on the Faithful: The False Prophets of the Investment World,'' the report says more than 15,000 Americans have lost more than $ 450 million in such scams in the last five years. A `` growing number of investment swindlers and other sharp operators ... play on religious beliefs in order to gain the trust, confidence and life savings of the faithful,'' the report says. It details major cases in 15 states where operators, usually feigning religious motives and sometimes claiming God-endowed business talents, gained confidence of believers _ and their cash. The sharp increase in such operations `` has resulted in a surge in state-level complaints from consumers about fraud and abuse by self-proclaimed ` born again' financial planners,'' the report says. It says they often pretend to be endorsed by local or national church officials or to offer `` divinely inspired investment advice about coins, precious metals, real estate and oil and gas well programs.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, says: `` It now appears that religiously oriented swindles are one of today's hottest tickets for investment con artists. `` The problem here is not religion, but the growing number of con artists who are cynically exploiting religious faith in order to fleece unsuspecting members of the flock.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McIlhenny </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureaus </ORGANIZATION>, says the religious swindler feigns interest in religious beliefs `` only insofar as they can be used to run a scam.'' `` They will go to any lengths, including the exploitation of churches and deeply held religious beliefs, if they think it will work. They will take their 30 pieces of silver any way they can get them.'' <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> describes this common mode of operation: A con artist picks some religiously identifiable group, passes himself off as a member in order to put victims at ease. They, in turn, often drop their guard and fail to check out him or the so-called investment opportunity. <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> said the approaches usually are much the same, but the promoted investments may be almost anything. He said one outfit used Old Testament prophecy to pinpoint spots for oil wells in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Many `` con artists advertise their services in religious publications and on Christian radio stations,'' he says, while others obtain religious mailing and telephone lists and use direct mail and `` cold-call'' tactics. Some operate on a `` face-to-face basis,'' renting church basements or making appearances before church social groups, he says. These schemes `` with the personal touch'' seem to hit the elderly hardest. Whenever a religiously oriented scam starts to unravel, <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> says the con artist often claims authorities were trying to `` ruin'' or `` embarrass'' the faith or church. `` Frequently this tactic gives the con artist the time he needs to move to the next congregation,'' <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> says. This can also delay complaints to state agencies so long that his `` trail is too cold to follow.'' <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> emphasizes that the five-year estimate of more than 15,000 Americans losing more than $ 450 million includes only large-scale religious scams, each with losses exceeding $ 500,000, and not smaller swindles. Offering tips for avoiding such scams, the report lists various danger signs, including: _ Investments that seem closely tied to a particular religious belief. _ An investment promoter who tries to capitalize on status or influence in a particular religious group. _ A new member turns up with a `` sure fire'' investment scheme. _ Any investments promoted by fellow church members, since the `` most persuasive hook'' of con artists is to get `` testimony of your friends and fellow believers.'' Sometimes swindlers plead for `` Christian forgiveness'' or warn of harm to the faith if the scam is exposed, the report says, adding: `` Do n't listen to these self-serving appeals'' or be talked into `` letting an investment crook off the hook. He or she will just take the opportunity to move on to greener pastures _ and new victims.''

 A professor at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> has resigned in a conflict with the administration over his teaching that a saved, believing Christian can fall into unbelief and be lost.

He says `` this view is compatible with the eternal security of the believer, since the apostate would no longer be a believer.'' A faculty affairs committee recommended that <PERSON> Tilley </PERSON> be retained in his regular post at the same pay, but this was not accepted by the school's trustees, mostly appointed by the denomination's fundamentalist leaders

This is another in a series of occasional reports by <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondents on <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> life _ one family's ordeal.

 For <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> and his family in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, it is a triumph just to get through the day. They are without water and electrity and have little fuel for cooking because of almost constant Syrian bombardment and a blockade of supplies. Even the most mundane day-to-day chores, washing dishes, cooking meals, doing the shopping, taking showers, are a challenge. Most of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s 1.5 million people, Christians and Moslem alike, have fled. But the <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> family, and thousands like them, stay on in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, keeping the city's pulse beating, however faintly; clinging tenaciously to the splinters of their lives despite the catastrophe that has befallen them. `` I dreamt we had electricity last night,'' said 13-year-old <PERSON> Rania </PERSON> <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>. `` In my dream I even saw light streaming from one of the rooms.'' She awakened from her dream and, half asleep, got up to turn on the stereo she has n't played for weeks. `` Then I realized that the light came from the candle,'' she said softly. In <PERSON> Rania </PERSON> <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>'s dream the electricity had come back on. <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>, 60, a calligrapher for a publishing house; his wife, <PERSON> Hiyam </PERSON>, 47; <PERSON> Rania </PERSON>, and her 17-year-old brother, <PERSON> Rabih </PERSON>, live in <LOCATION> Hazmieh </LOCATION>, one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. They live on the second floor of a five-story apartment block near the Green Line that divides the city into Christian and Moslem sectors, the front line in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. The area has been heavily shelled by the Syrian army in its 5-month-old battle with Christian militias. `` Some nights the shells fall in a torrent, like rain,'' <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> said. Every building around them has been hit at least once. Theirs has not. Luckily, it's surrounded by taller buildings. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Jaouden </PERSON>, one of their neighbors, went to the bakery for bread one recent morning during a lull in the shelling. On his way home, he was killed in a surprise barrage. The Abbouds' water taps are dry, their beds unused because it's too dangerous to sleep in them The refrigerator serves as a cupboard. The washing machine is silent, the lights out, the television dark. Water and electricity were cut off months ago. Mrs. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> hides her jewelry in a neighbor's pressure cooker. `` It's the last place I think thieves would look,'' she said. She has moved her favorite dresses from her bedroom in the outer, exposed part of the building to a hallway in the apartment for safety. Not that she wears them anyway. Social life stopped months ago. No one goes out unless they have to. Mrs. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> does n't bother with makeup any more and usually wears a loose, ankle-length Arabic gown known as an abaya around the apartment. `` I've forgotten what it's like to be a woman,'' she said. A widow, <PERSON> Fadwa </PERSON> <PERSON> Azar </PERSON>, and her son in the apartment next door have a gasoline-fueled generator on their balcony that runs their refrigerator, television set and other appliances. The Abbouds keep their essential foods in Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON>'s refrigerator. The Abbouds long for cold drinks _ no room for soft drinks in Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON>'s refrigerator. A hot meal is rare. The family has n't tasted ice cream or chilled fruit since the fighting broke out March 8 The Abbouds' apartment block does n't have an underground shelter, as many buildings do. So most nights the Abbouds sleep squeezed together on mattresses and quilts on the floor of a stuffy, unventilated hall in Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON>'s apartment at the rear of the building, less vulnerable to the shelling from the Moslem west side. `` Our life is dictated by the whims of the fighters,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> said. `` We sleep and we eat and we go to work when they allow us.'' Most fearsome are the 240mm and 180mm mortars the Syrians fire. The heavy-caliber weapons were designed to knock out underground military bunkers, bridges and airstrips. But they're being used against apartment and office buildings, causing awesome damage and many casualties. `` They're a nightmare,'' said son <PERSON> Rabih </PERSON>. `` We almost do n't mind what the Syrians fire any more _ except those damned 240s and 180s.'' On one recent day, the Abbouds were awakened at 5 a.m. They're usually not early risers, but the rumble of fighting along the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> made sleep impossible and they headed for the hallway in Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON>'s apartment The fighting subsided two hours later. The Abbouds wearily returned to their apartment, sticky from the humid summer heat, rubbing cramped legs and stiff necks. The temperature reaches 95 degrees during the day this time of year in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` I'd give anything, anything for one week of sleeping in my own bed,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> said with a sigh.

 Everyone had to wash with just half a bucket of water. Mrs. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> said they once went without washing for four days because the shelling was so heavy no one could go out to fetch water from a spring in the neighboring <LOCATION> Ashrafieh </LOCATION> district, a constant target for the Syrians. When there's gasoline to be found and the shelling stops, <PERSON> Rabih </PERSON> drives through the rubble-strewn streets to fill six 10-liter -LRB- 2 \ - gallon -RRB- plastic canisters with water from His mother frets while he's out, praying he'll get home before the shelling starts again. The family needs about 13 -LCB- gallons of water a day for drinking, washing dishes, bathing, flushing toilets and keeping the house clean. Mrs. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> has learned to wash the dishes in a bucket, then use the water to flush the toilet. Many Beirutis use bottled water for `` showers.'' One woman said: `` I use one for the front and another for the back.'' The Abbouds use the water sparingly, trying to keep some in reserve for the days when the shelling is heavy and <PERSON> Rabih </PERSON> ca n't go to the spring. At 8 a.m. one recent day Mrs. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Rania </PERSON> to fetch cheese, milk and yoghurt from Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON>'s `` collective fridge.'' <PERSON> Rania </PERSON> returned empty-handed. Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> was out and <PERSON> Rania </PERSON> could n't get into her apartment The Abbouds made do with stale bread dipped in olive oil and thyme. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> goes to the local bakery, if it's open, three days a week at 5 a.m. On a good day, he'll have to wait in line only an hour. Sugar is in short supply, to <PERSON> Rabih </PERSON>'s chagrin. He likes his tea sweet. After breakfast, <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> looked out the window at the street below. `` When I see people in the street, I reckon it's safe to go to work,'' said <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>, whose office is a 10-minute walk from his apartment. There was some traffic this day, so he made a run for it. He wore a wrinkled shirt because with no electricity his wife ca n't iron clothes. After he left, his wife fidgeted nervously until he telephoned to say he'd arrived safely. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> earns 80,000 Lebanese pounds -LRB- $ 160 -RRB- a month at calligraphy and, unlike many Lebanese, gets paid regularly. He supplements his salary with freelance work at home. His eldest son, <PERSON> Fadi </PERSON>, 26, who works in <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, regularly sends money home. Asked why he has n't taken the family out of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> said Moslem forces are near his cottage in the mountains at <LOCATION> Bikfaya </LOCATION> and it is just as exposed to shellfire as the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> apartment. He does n't think there's much difference where the family lives. As for fleeing abroad, `` I ca n't afford it,'' he said. Schools have been closed for five months. But <PERSON> Rabih </PERSON> and his sister do school work at home and turn it in to their teachers every two weeks, when they receive new assignments. Their father nags them to study for two hours a day. But <PERSON> Rabih </PERSON> said: `` It's really hard because I just ca n't concentrate.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> makes sure everyone's there when she prepares a meal because gas for cooking is scarce and she does n't want to waste it to reheat food. She buys gas for the stove in a container that once cost the equivalent of $ 1.50 and now sells for $ 16. As Mrs. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> was making lunch this day, <PERSON> Hazmieh </PERSON> came under shellfire again. The family ended up eating half-cooked french fries in the stairwell as the steaks lay uncooked on the kitchen table. When the shelling intensified, the Abbouds scurried to Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON>'s apartment. The fetid air and the constant pounding of exploding shells made everyone jittery. At nightfall, the shelling eased and the Abbouds groped their way back to their apartment in the dark to make sandwiches before returning to their `` bedroom'' in Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON>'s apartment. <PERSON> Rabih </PERSON> held a large bottle of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> and said longingly: `` If only you were ice cold.'' At 8 p.m. Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> turned on her television set to watch the evening news on the Christian network. Everyone listened intently to learn which areas had been hit, who'd been killed. The newscaster started on the foreign news. `` Switch it off,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> said, curtly. `` The world does n't care about us Why should we care what's happening to them?''

 As he stretched his long legs before a class, 18-year-old <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> recalled some of the less glamorous moments in his 13 years of ballet training. `` When I was younger, I'd get called a sissy,'' he said. `` I mean, ballet's not like the national pastime. It's not like football. It's not a thing that's in. And it's not a source of national pride like it is in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. I've been beaten up before, when I was in junior high here in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` But that's not the important thing. The important thing is that I'm doing what I want to do and it's something I'm good at. And no one can take that away from me.'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s devotion is a rare thing, and it has just paid a magnificent bonus: He has been accepted into the company of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> for the 1990 season. Like so many other aspiring and talented dancers, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> studied at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Many of the students are lured from area public schools for that chance at dance fame. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeal </PERSON> scouts schools for the company, interviewing children who in all likelihood have never even seen a ballet performed. Relying on experience and a little luck, he carefully selects youngsters to invite to the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> to determine if they might be destined to follow in the footsteps of <PERSON> Pavlova </PERSON> or <LOCATION> Nijinsky </LOCATION>. `` We try to identify students who have the talent, who can experience the joy of dance,'' he said. `` The first thing to look for is a spark in the eye. That one little spark is what we nurture along the way. `` Then there's the basics, the physicality _ the feet, the limbs, a good jumper _ and the musicality. ... You develop a keen eye. But you can not look at an 8-year-old and know if he will become a professional dancer.'' Students selected by <PERSON> McNeal </PERSON>, and scores of others auditioned through more traditional methods, find a rare opportunity at the school, whose mission is nothing less than to prepare its students for a career in ballet. Hundreds of schools across the country teach ballet, but only a few are affiliated with major companies. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> ranks among the best with a new multimillion-dollar facility, top instructors and a close tie to <PERSON> Helgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasson </PERSON>'s critically acclaimed company. Students need enough talent to get in, enough spirit to compete, enough stamina to sustain them and enough love for ballet that they'd gladly give up many of the joys of youth for a chance to dance. <PERSON> McNeal </PERSON> says only one in 100 of the 8-year-olds will ever dance professionally, and only half of those will dance with a major company. The school also auditions about 2,000 dancers in 15 cities each year to find the 140-150 students for its six-week intensive summer program. `` We select them because they show us some potential for professional careers by virtue of their physique, their prior training, their desire, their discipline, that sort of thing,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who danced with the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> before becoming the school's manager. A few summer students are invited to stay at the school at the end of the session. Still others come to the school after first studying ballet elsewhere in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. However they get there, each student seems to have caught `` ballet fever'' in a unique way. Maybe their mother took them to `` The Nutcracker'' on a rainy afternoon. Perhaps they saw <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> dance on television. Some started by studying tap or jazz. Whatever got them started, the result is the same: They all have the passion to dance. `` That's not to say every 8-year-old in the building has decided to be a professional ballet dancer,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` They do n't make that decision until they're a teen-ager, usually. `` However, no matter what else we teach them, our main goal is to make them professional ballet dancers.'' Students who start at age 8 soon learn how serious a challenge they face. `` And it becomes more serious very rapidly,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` In their first year of study, they take two classes a week. That's an hour and a half a class. By the second year, they're here three times a week. By the third year _ now they're 10 or 11 years old _ they're here three times a week, but they're taking six lessons. By the fourth year, it goes to eight.'' That means a child of 11 or 12 is taking 12 hours of class a week after school. Through the teen years, the training intensifies, forcing students to skip pep rallies, parties and after-school activities. But the students know they have to train if they want the rewards of a dance career. `` Their parents might think they're sacrificing,'' said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` Certainly, my parents thought I was missing out on a lot. But I also traveled the world three or four times with a ballet company and went to places my contemporaries have yet to go. `` You have the experiences of dancing for kings and queens. It's such a different kind of life, and the rewards are so great ... that I do n't know that dancers consider it a sacrifice. Certainly, <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> does n't. The 14-year-old has been dancing for seven years and last year performed as <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> in the company's staging of `` The Nutcracker.'' `` My mother was a dancer for a while and I saw pictures of her dancing, and I thought how wonderful it was. And I went to see ` The Nutcracker,' and I loved it,'' she said. `` If you have a strong will to become a dancer, it really can come true.'' Former student <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, 20, graduated from the school and was welcomed into the company last year. He started dancing jazz at age 6, switched to ballet at 13 and never regretted it for a moment. `` It's not a long career, like other fields where you can go into your 60s or 70s. But it's a great career with traveling and just being out on stage,'' he said.

<HEAD>Festival Reforms After von Karajan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SALZBURG, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With the death of conductor <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Festival </LOCATION> is changing its image to open up the celebrated cultural event to new forms of art and musicians who've never been invited to play `` The festival has become an old museum, unaware of what's going on artistically in the world. We should give modern music and drama the place they deserve,'' said <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Landesmann </PERSON>, a member of the festival board, in an interview. `` There is no crisis but just time for change. This necessity has been in the air for years.'' <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortier </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>, was recently named artistic director of the <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Festival </LOCATION> with a mandate to revamp the cultural showcase. For years, the festival had been criticized for being too expensive and a storehouse of the artistic totems of <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>, its longtime guiding spirit who died July 16 of a heart attack at age 81. The five-week festival opened July 27 with <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s opera `` Un Ballo in Maschera,'' under the baton of Sir <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Solti </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> had been criticized for his domineering and conservative stance. Italian media called the festival an `` intrigue nest,'' totally subordinated to <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>'s commercial interests. In his long career, <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> made more than 800 recordings, many of them with the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> orchestras. His fortune was estimated at 3.5 billion schillings -LRB- $ 270 million -RRB-. Although he resigned from the five-member directorate last August after an illness, he had retained a veto over virtually all productions. <PERSON> Landesmann </PERSON>, a wealthy <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> businessman with international contacts, was asked by the government to work out a reform program. In June, before <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>'s death, the board, overruling him, agreed in principle to <PERSON> Landesmann </PERSON>'s plan to modernize festival management. Under the plan, to be formally adopted in fall, the unpaid honorary five-man directorate will be replaced by a permanent salaried three-member board. The new board, comprising a president, an artistic director and an economic director will work full time for the festival, <PERSON> Landesmann </PERSON> said. `` We need new, forward-thinking people in the management, much more aware of the contemporary scene,'' he said. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moser </PERSON>, the festival president and a <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> loyalist who is to retire in 1991, will also be replaced. In another major change, <PERSON> Landesmann </PERSON> said he would like to include artists in the new artistic advisory board to counsel on new projects. He would also like to see more film and video galas and exhibits to be staged during the festival _ the world's longest-running and most costly one While not playing down the merits of Italian traditional operas, which have been performed here every year, <PERSON> Landesmann </PERSON> proposes to include other composers, such as <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> or <PERSON> Alban </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, the Austrian artist who combined atonality with the lyric and dramatic features of the Viennese romantic tradition. There is talk among festival organizers to devote the 2,600-seat Great Festival Hall to foreign classical opera and the Little Festival Hall to <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> productions. `` We want a repertoire consistent with the line of <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s heritage, something specific, typical of <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Landesmann </PERSON> said In an attempt to prevent the rise of another domineering maestro such as <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Landesmann </PERSON> said no permanent conductor will be named, but invitations will go out to such well-known figures as <PERSON> Solti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Muti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbado </PERSON> or Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON>, all of whom were in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> this summer. `` <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> was opposed to reforms. He was an old man and he did n't like changes He was opposed to see new people and he used to ask why should we change the structure of the festival,'' <PERSON> Landesmann </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>, who had conducted at the festival since 1948, was its sole artistic director in 1956-60 and a member of the directorate since 1964. Now in its 69th year, the <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION> festival pays some of the highest performer fees in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and charges some of the continent's top ticket prices. Five years ago, government auditors urged festival organizers to spend less. Press chief <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Widrich </PERSON> said the festival runs an anual budget of $ 27 million, of which state subsdies total $ 7.7 million with the rest coming from ticket sales, radio and TV rights. Ticket sales this year range from $ 4 for standing room at a concert of sacred music to $ 250 for the best seat at one of the opera performances. However, not all agree on the need for reform. <PERSON> Solti </PERSON>, musical director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, who replaced <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> for the Verdi opera, said the ticket prices should stay as they are. `` I do n't believe that lowering their price and making them cost 10 schillings -LRB- 77 cents -RRB- apiece would solve anything. All hotel doormen will rush to buy them officially and then resell them on the black market at a high profit,'' he said. <PERSON> Solti </PERSON> said he was not concerned about the artistic quality of the festival, which he considers very good. `` Politicians are talking too much. Once its quality goes down then you can say, ` hey, we must change something.' But not for the time being,'' he said. British film director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, who staged <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s opera on the opening night, praised <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>, saying `` There is no house in the world offering the kind of facilities, expertise and officialdom's support we get here. We do n't think we will find again similar conditions.''

 The government's leading wildlife official says <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s game parks remain safe despite four fatal attacks since July, including the slaying of conservationist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>, the director of wildlife, blamed the attacks on elephant poachers who have turned to banditry after being driven out of the animal reserves by <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s campaign to save its elephant population. He noted that the three fatal attacks before <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> was slain Aug. 20 took place in particularly remote areas and far from the usual tourist or safari trails. His death and the killings of a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> woman and a French couple in July raised fears for the health of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s tourist industry, the country's No. 1 income earner. But <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> said he saw no reason for visitors to fear for their safety so long as they stay in regular tourist areas and on main roads. `` I have traveled widely in the last few weeks to assess the situation for myself,'' he said after <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>'s death. `` Most of our wildlife areas where the majority of tourists go are in my judgment reasonably safe and there should be no need for tourists to fear going there.'' The 83-year-old <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> was shot to death near his camp at the remote <ORGANIZATION> Kora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> while trying to help an assistant and a guest who were being robbed by three gunmen. <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, a retired game warden, had lived in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> since 1924 and, with his wife, <PERSON> Joy </PERSON>, helped to popularize conservation through their practice of releasing captive lions into the wild. Joy, who was killed by a servant in 1980, detailed the unique practice in the books `` Born Free,'' `` Living Free,'' and `` Forever Free,'' which subsequently were made into movies. In July, a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> husband and wife were killed in the Meru game park, east of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, when they stumbled onto a group of poachers while driving down a seldom-used track. Little more than two weeks later, on July 27, nine men attacked a 19-member tour group organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> on a 40-mile stretch of dirt road between the southern national parks of <LOCATION> Tsavo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Amboseli </LOCATION>, killing <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bethany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. Seven tourists have been wounded in separate attacks since September a year ago. Tour operators say several hundred tourists, mostly Americans, have been frightened off by the violence. Although the cancellations were quickly replaced by new bookings, the tour operators expressed fears <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>'s death would prompt other tourists to cancel or defer plans to visit <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. `` They call and want to know if it's safe to come to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>,'' said the manager of one large safari company who spoke on condition he not be identified by name. `` We try to reassure them.'' Another safari group said it received 50 cancellations in the four days after <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> died. Tourism is of prime concern to the government. Last year, a record 660,000 tourists visited <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s game parks and <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> beach resorts and brought in an estimated $ 350 million, outstripping income from the main export, coffee. The tour operators expressed their anxieties recently at a meeting with <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>, who sought to allay their fears. He said roads, allowed to fall into disrepair in recent years, were being regraded and resurfaced to provide quicker and therefore safer journeys. Plainclothes security officers have been posted in most of the major tourist lodges in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s game parks, he said. In an interview later, <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> claimed that because of the intensified anti-poaching operation, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s tourist attractions actually are safer now than six months ago. Most of the attacks, he said, had occurred outside the national parks. Using more than 300 new weapons and 45 new vehicles, along with increased air surveillance and renewed foot patrols, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> has brought poaching virtually to a halt since <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>'s appointment in April. The number of elephants killed has dropped from an average three a day to three since June, he said. In the last decade, the slaughter by poachers reduced <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s elephant population from 65,000 to 17,000. About three dozen poachers have been killed in the combined effort by the department of wildlife, police and paramilitary units, said <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>. In the last few months no game rangers have died at poachers' hands. The revitalized effort has brought poachers under new pressures, <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> said. `` Previously people were n't being hurt because they did n't feature high on poachers' lists because elephants were so easy to get,'' he said Now, he added, `` they do n't know where to go, they have nothing, they're short of cash and they've turned to robbery.'' <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> said the government believed it was dealing with fewer than 100 of the armed bandits, whom he identified as indigent Somalis called Shifta who have fled their war-torn, impoverished country to exploit <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s elephants for their ivory tusks. Ivory fetches $ 110 to $ 155 a pound on the world market, a record price. `` Until very recently, there was very easy money to be made in the national parks by killing elephants,'' <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> said. `` Nobody was after them. There was no danger. It's very risky now to go into <LOCATION> Tsavo </LOCATION> if you're a poacher.'' Although <PERSON> Shifta </PERSON> have robbed and harrassed citizens in eastern <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> since the early 1960s, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiles </PERSON>, an anthropologist who has studied Shiftas for nearly two decades, said many of those perpetrating the violence were deserters from <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>'s army which is fighting a rebellion in northern <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> said the Shifta were spread along a swath of arid, remote territory from <LOCATION> Tsavo </LOCATION>'s periphery up to <PERSON> Meru </PERSON> and posed little threat to those who stayed on main roads and tourist byways.

 If you did n't know better, you'd swear it was this TV season, not last year's, suffering from the creative woes of a writers strike. The 1989-90 season that officially begins Sept. 18 offers witches, nuns, inner-city teachers, cute families and buddy cops. Very little here has n't been seen before. Alarmingly, there are fewer exceptions to the rule that network fare must strive to reach new depths of mediocrity. This is n't going to help the networks stem the audience erosion that has plagued them in recent years. Who would n't rather rent a movie that be stuck with `` Baywatch?'' In seasons past, previewing the fall shows generally revealed a few that broke the same-old-stuff mold _ the `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Places'' and `` Miami Vices'' and `` Hill Street Blueses.'' Most of this year's new shows range from dismal to mediocre _ BUT ... <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> does have the admirable `` Life Goes On,'' a wry and realistic family drama whose cast includes a real-life Down's syndrome actor playing a teen-age son who has the condition. And CBS has `` The Famous Teddy Z,'' a sophisticated, inside-show business comedy starring <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cryer </PERSON> -LRB- `` Pretty in Pink'' -RRB- as a mail-room nobody instantly elevated to high-powered agent. It was created by <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who was owed one by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> after the network canceled his critically acclaimed `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place.'' <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carsey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>, producers of the hits `` The Cosby Show,'' `` Roseanne'' and `` A Different World,'' will try to do it again with `` Chicken Soup,'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, starring stand-up comic <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> as a nice Jewish man having an affair with his <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> neighbor, played by <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>. And CBS has `` Major Dad,'' a sitcom starring the bankable <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McRaney </PERSON> -LRB- `` <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Simon'' -RRB- as a macho, right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> trying to adjust to married life with a liberal wife -LRB- <PERSON> Shanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> -RRB- and three step-daughters. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> could break some ground with the political crime drama `` <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>,'' starring <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Loggia </PERSON> as the burned-out <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent he played in the provocative miniseries `` Favorite Son.'' And no one can accuse <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howser </PERSON>, M.D.'' of copy-catting. The half-hour `` dramedy,'' from <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> -LRB- `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' `` Hooperman'' -RRB- revolves around a 16-year-old boy wonder who is a physician. Otherwise, the fall lineup looks like rehashes, also-rans and sleep aids. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had little room for improvement, having already pummeled <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS for four seasons. But in its effort to seek the perfect prime-time schedule it has deigned to do some minor tinkering, adding five new shows. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> added nine and eight, respectively. There's <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Sister <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>,'' starring <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON>, former glamour girl on `` Dynasty,'' who is surprisingly well-cast as a crotchety nun with a passel of precious urchins. `` <ORGANIZATION> Nutt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'' is mindless slapstick about an ill-run <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hotel, starring <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Korman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cloris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leachman </PERSON>. It comes from <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, who teamed with wunderkind <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, creator of `` Sledge Hammer!'' It is paired with `` Night Court,'' which looks like educational television by comparison. What would society do without a network hour devoted to the emotional involvements of scantily clad lifeguards? <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has met the challenge with `` Baywatch,'' sadly the only show on this season from Mr. Quality Television, Grant Tinker's company. Do you miss `` Miami Vice?'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> replaces it with another buddy-cops show. This time, it's old cop-young cop and called `` Hardball.'' Not as much style as `` Vice,'' but good character possibilities. Third-place <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, which has the greatest need for breakout shows, has settled instead for a bottom-of-the-barrel ratings ploy, `` Rescue 911,'' a graphic `` reality-based'' show about emergency calls. It is a throwback to the early days of last season when the writers strike crippled production of fiction shows and the networks had to stoop to stuff like this. This season, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> is putting it on by choice. CBS' `` Island Son'' lured perennial miniseries star <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> back to series television with a <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> locale and a role as a doctor. It was n't available for pre-season scrutiny. `` The People Next Door,'' a sitcom about a cartoonist and his family, relies on special effects and apparently hopes to capitalize on the success of `` Who Framed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>.'' It's an ambitious attempt, but does n't work. `` Wolf'' stars <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> in another version of the discredited cop who becomes a private eye and tries to clear his name. There's nothing to help viewers pick this one out of a lineup CBS' `` Peaceable Kingdom'' stars the durable <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> as a remarkably boring zoo administrator. The cheetah is a better actor. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> -LRB- `` Wiseguy,'' `` Hunter'' -RRB- has a third network show, `` Top of the Hill,'' starring <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Katt </PERSON> -LRB- `` Greatest American Hero'' -RRB- as a long-haired surfer who takes over his ailing father's congressional seat. Civics 101 was more riveting. `` Snoops'' is a screwball mystery-comedy starring <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daphne </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, former stars of `` Frank's Place.'' He is a professor of criminology, she is a protocol officer. Nothing was available for pre-screening, but these are likable stars. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s ballyhooed deal with <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> has yielded the questionable but competent `` <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howser </PERSON>,'' starring <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> as the 16-year-old genius with a medical license. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> made a little headway with the Western `` Paradise'' last season. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, perhaps inspired more by the success of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Lonesome Dove,'' adds another of the long-missing Western genre, `` The Young Riders,'' about the Pony Express. It needs better writing. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> has two innocuous spinoffs. From `` Who's the Boss?'' comes `` Living Dolls,'' a sitcom about four teen-aged models sharing an apartment in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Learned </PERSON> stars as their den mother. The other is `` Family Matters,'' a black family sitcom centered on the extended family of acerbic elevator operator, <PERSON> Harriette </PERSON>, of `` Perfect Strangers.'' A writer-producer spun off <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Head of the Class'' to create a black `` Welcome Back, Kotter'' in the new `` Homeroom.'' In <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Free Spirit'' a housekeeper who's a witch goes to work for a single father. What comic possibilities! To recap, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> has two good bets in `` Major Dad'' and `` Teddy Z,'' both joining the reasonably successful Monday comedy lineup. But they'll likely be moved to other nights. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Life Goes On'' deserves a break and might get one. It's in a time period opposite the top-10 `` 60 Minutes'' and is n't expected to do boffo numbers, so it might stay around a Critical response should help it. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Chicken Soup'' is an acquired taste, but it has a cushy time slot, behind `` Roseanne.'' Hey, a lot of people think <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> is very funny. Likely goners, due to low quality and-or tough competition, include `` Homeroom,'' `` Peaceable Kingdom,'' `` Wolf'' and `` Free Spirit.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Nutt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'' could get a cult following of over-medicated viewers, but do n't bet on it. The rest of the pack merit little more than a shrug. So there you have one of the reasons that almost two-thirds of homes with televisions also have cable and why a third of viewers opted for something other than network programs last season. This season, those people will pay their cable bills happily.

<HEAD>Networks Set to Face Sponsor Scrutiny</HEAD>

 Networks are beginning the new TV season with a new fact of life _ increasing sponsor scrutiny of the shows on which their ads appear. The heads of the networks insist there will be no censorship by advertisers or pressure groups, but they also say they're looking more closely at shows of questionable taste. The question is whose `` taste'' will prevail? <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON>, whose network vowed to air the critically acclaimed but controversial TV movie about abortion, `` Roe vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>,'' without sponsorship, if it came to that, said he was concerned about a possible trend toward programming-by-boycott last season. `` What you become concerned about is sort of a new McCarthyism,'' he said. `` What I was fearful of is, today ` The Sex Tapes,' tomorrow ` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>.''' Last season, sponsors balked at so-called `` trash TV'' fare, but also at `` Roe vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>,'' because of the subject and the critically praised miniseries `` Lonesome Dove,'' because of its authentically raunchy Western dialogue. But the network bosses said advertisers, from whom the networks draw their revenues, have the right to withhold sponsorship of shows to which they object and in fact have always shied away from certain programs. `` We get advertiser pullout all the time,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> Entertainment President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> LeMasters </PERSON>. `` That is a normal landscape for network television.'' Some advertisers, he said, `` will not advertise in any show that has water in it, or it has certain cars in it that are offensive to them.'' Advertiser boycotts do n't become tantamount to censorship, <PERSON> LeMasters </PERSON> said, unless the network bows to the pressure. Of controversial shows, he said, `` I plan to continue to broadcast them. That is our ultimate statement.'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON> sees advertiser sensitivity as part of a larger viewer `` revolt'' against sexually explicit or violent fare. `` The message to the creative community is again that taste, albeit difficult to define, still revolves around quality, and that the audience is smarter at that then you tend to think,'' he said. `` We can defend ourselves when we put something on the air that's really worth defending And some of the sitcoms in which -LRB- sex -RRB- is a one-track theme, alienate the viewers.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> President and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> executive, said advertisers are simply responding to consumer desires and do n't have any sinister intent to censor what's on the airwaves `` They scare off real easy when it comes to ... having their company's name associated with something, even though it might not have any real impact. What I have been trying to do is get them to focus in on that and say, listen, investigate the real facts. Try to make a more informed opinion.'' The networks believe that allowing advertisers to pre-screen shows will help educate them. But at a meeting of television critics this summer, concern was voiced that pre-screening would be an even bigger step toward censorship. No, say the network executives. Advertisers will see completed shows and those will go on the air regardless of their reaction. They hope pre-screening will let advertisers make an informed decision and counteract any biased information from special-interest groups. `` Overall, I think they -LRB- advertisers -RRB- have pretty strong feelings on their own, and they do n't need any help from the outside,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sias </PERSON>. `` When they do make a decision, obviously, it's in the interest of third parties who want this to make it appear that that pressure has been primarily responsible for it.'' At the critics meeting, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> housewife who organized a boycott of the hilarious but admittedly often tasteless <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> comedy `` Married ... With Children'' had backed off some of her earlier criticisms and now advocates policing the airwaves only during `` family'' viewing hours. `` What we're saying is self-regulate,'' she said. `` You know the boundaries. We're not in the line-drawing business. You draw the line.'' The networks apparently plan to do that. <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> told the critics, `` I do think there were some instances, as I'm sure, having read a lot of your individual columns, you felt, too, that there was some line-crossing and some shows that were ill-advised to have been broadcast in the form that they were, and we've recognized that.'' <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON> said the bottom line is, as always, viewer discretion. `` I have a sort of vague feeling that censorship, like charity, should begin at home, but unlike charity, should stay there.''

<HEAD>Antidote to the Networks? Try A Dose of PBS</HEAD>

 It's really easy. It really is. Just turn the channel. Press the remote a few times. There. See, it's PBS. It wo n't hurt you. It's almost like real TV, listed there in the television guide along with all the garbage on commercial TV. Sure, there are a few good network shows and there's some decent stuff on cable but you've rented all the worthwhile videos, and after a steady diet of `` Rambo'' and `` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> in Charge'' you feel kind of grimy, vaguely out of sorts It's time for a dose of PBS. Think of it as oat bran for the mind. Agreed, there may not be the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> blockbusters of seasons past, and how many of us really need to know how to restore an 18th-century farmhouse? But there will be some incredible gems, like <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON>' interviews with the late mythologist and storyteller <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, or a brilliant work of fiction, such as `` A Very British Coup.'' Here are some programs to choose from, circle in the TV Guide, and watch. Every remote control can be trained to find the PBS channel. <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON> has a new series this season, on contemporary poetry, promising to make an esoteric subject more accessible to average viewers. Think how impressed the folks around the water cooler will be. When some bozo is talking about `` Rescue 911,'' you can wax erudite, talking about `` Travels'' a 12-parter following sojourners on unusual treks, such as an American comedian's tour of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and a motorcyclist's trip across <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. If `` Art of the Western World'' sounds like a college course, it is. The series, filmed on location in 10 countries, examines the development of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> art from classical Greek and Roman works to 20th-century masters. It is being offered as a college-level course by the <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Learning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. You did n't pay attention to this stuff in school and wish you had. Here's a second chance. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Century'' is a six-part examination of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foreign policy in the 20th century. Great stuff for wowing the cocktail party crowd. So is <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON>' other series, `` The Public Mind,'' a four-part discussion of how news, politics, advertising and business are evolving to meet the demands of an increasingly image-obsessed culture. It's ironic you're only watching to impress someone. Remember all those great old network documentaries? They were like pieces on `` 60 Minutes,'' except longer. Those are on PBS now. This season they're on the Palestinian uprising, AIDS and the high cost of growing old, the latter a special anchored by <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON>. Other documentaries focus on people, from <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> to <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>. `` The American Experience'' is back. It's an anthology of documentaries about various chapters in American history. Also back is `` Trying Times,'' like a sitcom, only funnier and smarter. And look at this season's stars: <PERSON> Geena </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegert </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, Judge <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stockard </PERSON> <PERSON> Channing </PERSON>. The venerable `` Great Performances'' will present new productions of `` Showboat'' and `` Our Town.'' `` Masterpiece Theatre'' offers what promises to be a great miniseries of `` A Tale of Two Cities,'' the one you bought the Classic Comic to instead of reading the assignment. Now you realize it was a great book. Here's a chance to see the motion picture. Two ongoing series have new hosts. -LRB- You need to know this in case you talk to a longtime PBS viewer. -RRB- <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigg </PERSON> takes over from <ORGANIZATION> Vincent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> on `` Mystery!'' and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> takes over from <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Vilas </PERSON> on `` This Old House.'' That's the home repair and restoration show that inexplicably fascinates you on lazy Saturday afternoons. To welcome the newcomers, <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> even has a new logo, an animated, crystalized version of that `` everyman'' face in the PBS `` P.'' So there it is. You might not want to watch everything, but there's bound to be something there for every viewer. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> has a comedy about a witch, for <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>'s sake. You're going to have to find something to watch, right? Might as well be PBS. Go on. It's like jumping into the water. There's that initial shock, but then you get used to it. Pay yourself a dollar for every hour you watch, or pay PBS. You might find you'll want to.

 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Homeroom'' borrows heavily from other schoolroom comedies but adds nothing new, other than making its protagonist black.

 The producers of the uninspired but inoffensive sitcom `` The <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> Family'' on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> have a new uninspired but inoffensive sitcom on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Family Matters'' is spun off the elevator operator from `` Perfect Strangers.''

<TEXT>
 The best new comedy of the season is CBS' `` The Famous Teddy Z,'' a fortuitous pairing of producer <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> -LRB- `` Frank's Place'' -RRB- and teen-film star <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cryer </PERSON> -LRB- `` Pretty in Pink'' -RRB- <PERSON> Cryer </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakalokis </PERSON>, a mailroom clerk in the huge Unlimited Talent Agency who is suddenly thrust into the thick of show business. When he is sent on a gofer assignment, picking up an eccentric, Brando-like star at the airport, he winds up punching out the actor, impressing the guy so much he makes Teddy his agent. In-jokes abound, and viewers will delight at being in on them. Like <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s other comedies -LRB- he also did `` WKRP in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>'' -RRB-, the supporting characters are as well drawn as the lead. At a television critics meeting this summer, the critics were going around quoting Al Floss -LRB- <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> -RRB-, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s quintessential big-time agent. Floss to secretary: `` What are you, a statue? Screen the people who come in here!'' `` Teddy Z'' is well-placed on Monday between `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'' and `` Designing Women.'' The only time the comedy drags is when <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> goes home to his little Greek `` granny'' and younger brother, <PERSON> Ari </PERSON>. But future plots sound promising. <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> gets a new client, a monkey who has been bounced from a hit network sitcom. `` Teddy Z'' is sophisticated fun and everybody in it deserves to be famous.

 CBS' `` Major Dad'' is n't uniformly funny _ pun intended _ but it does deserve a salute. The bankable <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McRaney </PERSON> -LRB- `` <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Simon'' -RRB- stars as Marine Maj. <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. `` Mac'' <PERSON> MacGillis </PERSON>. He has a simple Marine philosophy: `` See the hill, take the hill.'' That's how he manages to woo and win a bride in one 30-minute pilot. She is <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, a liberal-thinking newspaper reporter with three daughters, and is played by newcomer <PERSON> Shanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. The chemistry between <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> and <PERSON> McRaney </PERSON> and the natural setting for comic conflict bodes well for a long tour of duty. `` Major Dad'' has a tough assignment, leading off CBS' Monday lineup of comedies. But as Mac says, `` See the hill, take the hill.''

 The weak link in CBS' Monday comedy lineup is the new `` The People Next Door,'' a rare example of too much of a mediocre thing. This special-effects sitcom is about a cartoonist named <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> -RRB- whose imagination becomes reality, producing visions of talking moose, buzzing airplanes and giant green monsters other people can see, too. There's also a complex sitcom family who are as unfunny as <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>'s creations are weird. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> is about to wed <PERSON> Abigail </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> -RRB- and has moved into her small-town home where she lives with her crotchety sister -LRB- <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickles </PERSON> -RRB-, their mother's ashes and <PERSON> Abigail </PERSON>'s psychiatry practice. There's more. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> has two children, a teen-age son and a daughter, whose alleged overbite supplies most of the attempted laugh lines in the pilot. There are some cute moments in `` People Next Door.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> does a cameo as one of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>'s imaginings, arriving with grand piano to croon `` Imagination Is Funny.'' And <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> pops up on a TV screen, intoning a promo for a show on `` Men with overactive imaginations _ and the women who love them.'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> then envisions the set exploding. The gimmickry ca n't long carry an unfunny sitcom _ hey, did n't somebody say the same thing when `` ALF'' premiered Nevertheless, expect `` The People Next Door'' to be moving soon.

<HEAD>ABC's `Life Goes On' Realistic, Funny Family Drama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Life Goes On'' is the best family drama since `` thirtysomething,'' though its style is of the more traditional `` Family.'' The title comes from the <ORGANIZATION> Beatles </ORGANIZATION> song, `` Obla-di, Obla-da,'' and is the reigning philosophy of the Thachers, a middle-class family struggling to make ends meet. The show is getting a lot of attention because one of its cast members is <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, an actor with Down's syndrome who plays teen-age son <PERSON> Corky </PERSON>. Much of the pilot plot revolves around <PERSON> Corky </PERSON>'s challenge, to `` mainstream'' with kids at a regular school, including his younger sister. <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> LuPone </PERSON> -LRB- `` Evita'' -RRB- is a surprise as TV mom <PERSON> Libby </PERSON> <PERSON> Thacher </PERSON>, but she is well cast, as is <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Smitrovich </PERSON> -LRB- `` Crime Story'' -RRB- who plays her husband, <PERSON> Drew </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Becca </PERSON>, a perpetually embarrassed eighth-grader apalled at having to attend junior high school with her brother. <PERSON> Monique </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Paige </PERSON>, <PERSON> Drew </PERSON>'s daughter from a previous marriage. She has broken up with her boyfriend and been forced to move back home. The pilot is funny and poignant, nicely written by executive producer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Braverman </PERSON>. In the pilot, <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> is trying to come up with the money to buy into a construction company. It would help a lot if he could depend on the extra $ 5,000 a year the family will save on <PERSON> Corky </PERSON>'s tuition _ IF <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> can make it in a regular, public junior high school. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Libby </PERSON> is facing her 40th birthday and <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> is trying to figure what she's doing with her life, while <PERSON> Becca </PERSON> learns that <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> might not be such a bad addition to the social whirl at school when he immediately befriends the football star. `` Life Goes On'' goes into a tough Sunday time period, opposite CBS' `` 60 Minutes.'' Still, that means <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is n't expecting its ratings to go through the roof, so it might get to stay around for a while. And it will get a head start when the pilot is aired a second time after the hit `` Roseanne.'' This is a nice show with a lot of heart that deserves to go on and on.

<TEXT>
 There's nothing wrong with CBS' new crime drama `` <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>,'' but there's nothing particularly right about it, either. It's `` Rockford Files'' without the humor, `` Wiseguy'' without the offbeatness, `` Miami Vice'' without the style. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> plays an Italian-American former cop who was busted from the force after he was framed. He reunites with his old-country father, <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirola </PERSON> -RRB-, and buys a fishing boat. A chance to work as a private eye gives him the opportunity to clear his name. The pilot is competent but there's no compelling reason to watch `` <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>,'' except for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> setting. The series probably wo n't be around long. It has drawn a Tuesday time period opposite <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` In the Heat of the Night'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s hit `` Roseanne. Expect `` Wolf'' to whimper off soon into the Nielsen woods.

 With `` Miami Vice'' and `` <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'' gone, we're in desperate need of a new buddy-cops show. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> to the rescue with `` Hardball,'' replacing `` Miami Vice'' on Friday. So what if this is a worn, old premise. It works when it's done right, and it's done right in `` Hardball.'' This time we have the engaging pairing of balding tough guy Charlie Battles -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON> -RRB- with <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> `` Kaz'' Kaczierowski -LRB- <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> -RRB-, a hunk with long hair and a <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>. We know the drill. These two misfits are partners. Battles does n't like anything about <PERSON> Kaz </PERSON>, his hair, his name, his attitude. <PERSON> Kaz </PERSON> is merely amused. Of course, when the chips are down, <PERSON> Kaz </PERSON> will prove his worth and eventually he and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> will form a grudging friendship. Producer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lupo </PERSON> is a former partner of <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> in `` Hunter'' for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Hardball'' joins an all-new lineup on Friday night, the only night of the week where No. 1 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> still has problems and has been rotating series trying to find something that will stick. `` Hardball'' could be a keeper.

<HEAD>Are We Too Cynical for A Hero Congressman?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> LOS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> ANGELES </LOCATION> -LRB- A -RRB- _ The pilot for `` Top of the Hill'' has been kicking around so long one of the actors has died and another is in another network's sitcom. Finally, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> bought it from <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> -LRB- `` Wiseguy,'' `` Hunter'' -RRB-. `` Top of the Hill,'' its name wisely changed from `` Lame Duck,'' tests credibility by creating a hero who is a crusading congressman. But we are being cynical. Even in this age of <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> scandals of the week, there are some heroes in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> is inspired by an older example, Rep. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, who was killed while investigating the <LOCATION> Jonestown </LOCATION> cult. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Katt </PERSON> -LRB- `` Greatest American Hero'' -RRB- plays <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a 36-year-old surfer elected to fill out the term of his ailing father, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> `` Pat'' Bell Sr. -LRB- <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> -RRB-. At the hands of a veteran House leader, played in the pilot by the late <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> MacMillan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> learns he has to play ball to get anything done for his constituency. <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohrer </PERSON>, who is playing a witch in the new <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> sitcom `` Free Spirit,'' was the love interest. Much of the pilot is taken up with explaining how <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> works until that becomes tedious and <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> segues into a clone of <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> and heads for a fictional Latin American country to do battle with drug lords. He's a little slow at this at first. He tells them he has diplomatic immunity. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> takes on this mission to search for the missing son of a constituent, who had been scouring <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for help. `` Top of the Hill'' goes into a forget-it time period on Thursday opposite <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s comedies, so do n't expect Congressman Bell to get re-elected.

 <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J.F </PERSON>. <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> is best-known in international business circles as chairman and chief executive of H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the food giant famous for ketchup, baked beans and pickles. But in his native land he's <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>, eminent Irishman. `` I'm very comfortable with my Irishness, and very proud of it,'' says <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>, 53, multimillionaire, philanthropist, rugby hero, lawyer, agriculturalist, publisher, campaigner for peace in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and symbol of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s transformation from rural backwater to modern industrial society. `` I see myself as a manager in the world of <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>,'' he says. `` I see myself in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> as an innovator, a creator, a pacifier.'' Having worked in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for 18 years, he is considered one of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s most successful expatriates. <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> is not universally adored in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, perhaps partly because of what <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> calls `` old-fashioned Irish begrudgery,'' exacerbated by <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>'s flashy life. `` Small countries do n't like tall poppies,'' <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> says. `` I think I've hardened against that.'' He spoke during an interview in the drawing room of <LOCATION> Castlemartin </LOCATION>, his 28-room Georgian manor. It overlooks the meandering <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liffey </LOCATION> and paddocks where his white Charolais cattle and bay and brown racehorses graze. The 500-acre estate lies 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kildare </LOCATION>, and is green, of course. `` This is the center,'' says <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>, who also owns houses in western <PERSON> Cork </PERSON>, and near <LOCATION> Heinz </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> headquarters. `` It clearly is my spiritual home. The rhythm of life, I get from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> retains his Irish citizenship and accent, and occasionally speaks Irish `` to confuse the enemy.'' He usually spends a weekend a month in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, typically continuing on to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Heinz </LOCATION> business. He vacations in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and says he intends to return here to live out his life. Wherever he is, <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> calls the managers of his Irish investments daily. He is 6-feet-2 and struggles with his weight. Silver-haired and ruddy, he is a dapper dresser who likes to splash on the cologne. He is hospitable and likes to joke. After meeting <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, the Marxist leader of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> told him: `` We're both students of <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>. You of Karl, and me of <PERSON> Groucho </PERSON>.'' Like any good Irishman, he constantly refers to the island's great writers, and believes luck has contributed to his success `` The thing I dislike most about <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is the absolute tyranny with which history is imposed today, this reaching back to history as a guide to the future. It's a straitjacket,'' he said. He was referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s guerrilla war to rid <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> of British rule and unite the province with the republic. `` We are not for that,'' said <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic who believes in the non-violent unification of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` I consider the terrorist divide to be one of the great stains on Irish history. `` I do believe that the unification of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is not worth shedding one drop of blood.'' In 1976 <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> founded the <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Fund, a charity that has raised millions of dollars in <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for solving social problems caused by the fighting in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Similar funds operate in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. He chairs them all. <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> denies persistent speculation that his goal is a political career, and has rejected an offer to serve as <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s agriculture minister Still, he has strong opinions on Irish issues. He says <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s high taxes should be cut, and divorce and abortion legalized He also says a successful international businessman is an `` enormously important political role model for the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s biggest newspaper owner, as chairman and main shareholder of <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, with titles that include the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> and tabloid Sunday World. He also is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Fitzwilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a holding company with interests that range from a retail chain to a sign maker. <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>'s other Irish business ventures include oil prospecter <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, several hotels and a license to practice law His personal fortune exceeds $ 100 million, he says. <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> says he told <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> before taking the $ 4 million-a-year job that he would not abandon his Irish pursuits. `` It was all up front,'' <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said. `` There's never been a conflict of interest.'' <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> in 1936, the only child of the chief customs inspector. At age 6, <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION> Belvedere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, an exclusive Jesuit school where writer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> was educated. Within eight months of leaving school at age 18, he had become one of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s greatest rugby players. His career spanned the'50s,'60s and'70s, he played 29 internationals for <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and in 1955 set a record for touchdowns scored on tours, which remains unbroken. Enlarged photographs of <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> the rugby player adorn the walls of his house. He talks about the game constantly, using it as an analogy for business and life. `` It taught me a fervent and never-ending respect for collegiality. We shared the rewards, we shared the losses.'' He excelled academically as well. He attended <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dublin </ORGANIZATION>, where he studied law, and then the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bradford </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, for a Ph.D. in agriculture. <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> became head of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and soon displayed his marketing abilities by inventing Kerrygold, the internationally known Irish butter brand name. He then managed Irish food companies doing business with <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>. The foodmaker's executives were impressed with the young <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>, and in 1969, they offered him the job of managing director of <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>'s British operations. Within four years, he was president of the entire company, and in 1987, when <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> died, <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> succeeded him as the first non-family chairman in the company's 119-year history. <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> has energized the $ 6 billion concern by cutting costs, tying pay more closely to performance, promoting stock ownership among employees, and expanding into the faster-growing baby, pet and diet food industries. <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>'s rugby-team spirit apparently makes him well-liked among <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>'s 40,000 employees, and his profit-making talents are popular with shareholders. He loves a party and entertains celebrity friends lavishly, often with his own singing and piano-playing. He travels on <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>'s corporate jet and in cigar-equipped luxury cars <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> married Australian-born <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>, a former concert pianist, in 1962 and they have six children, including triplets. Aside from Irishness, what makes <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> tick? `` With the philosophy of ` Gee thanks, what have you done for me today,' I feel myself in a sense of permanent competition with the world outside,'' he says. But, he says, `` There is the constant inherent contradiction of success and the enjoyment of success. `` Here I am in this lovely Celtic setting which I see eight weeks out of the year, and never leave without regret and a backward glance.''

<TEXT>
 First come the ambassadors of <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>, puffing and swinging their arms as they jog around the sports field. Behind them is the envoy from <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION>, sweat pouring down his face. Bringing up the rear is the ambassador of <PERSON> Burkina </PERSON> <PERSON> Faso </PERSON>, pedaling a bicycle. Just a normal Saturday morning for the diplomats from French-speaking <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. They gather at 9, jog for a while, swing from exercise bars, then get down to a rough-and-tumble soccer match. `` Attrape le bal, attrape le bal!'' -LRB- catch the ball -RRB- screamed His Excellency <PERSON> Ellom-Kodjo </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuppius </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION> as the ball zoomed to the edge of the field. This time the diplomats were playing against some African students who generally turn up at the field Saturday mornings. Other times they just kick the ball around among themselves. All week long the diplomats sit behind their desks, hold meetings and attend receptions. The weekly workout is a chance to sweat the whiskey and good food out of their systems and keep in shape, they said. But when they discard their formal attire, they are still mindful of their position. One is wearing a Dior sweat suit, another sports a <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION>. `` We believe in a sound mind in a sound body,'' said <PERSON> Paul-Desire </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabore </PERSON>, the ambassador of <PERSON> Burkina </PERSON> <PERSON> Faso </PERSON> who acts as dean of the informal ambassadorial club. The club unites 12 French-speaking African countries, some of the poorest in the world, who pool their time and resources to attract <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment and organize projects to benefit their homelands. The others are <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>. The 12 ambassadors are traveling to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> next month to take part in a trade and investment fair, and they hope to get a game together there, possibly with some of the American participants, <PERSON> Kabore </PERSON> said. Ambassadors who are too out of shape to play soccer or jog sometimes come out on Saturday mornings to watch or walk laps around the field. Ambassador <PERSON> Moumouni </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamou </PERSON> <PERSON> Djermakoye </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> is an active participant. In fact, he might be called an over-achiever. In addition to the weekly match and jogging, he rides his bicycle 13 miles every Sunday and plays basketball. He has already held the posts of foreign affairs minister, minister of health, youth and sports, and served as a regional governor. He came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> a year ago. <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION>'s Schuppius, who has been here six years, also plays tennis on the weekends and walks everywhere he can. `` It helps me get in shape, mentally and physically, for the week,'' he said. Many ambassadors in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have swimming pools and tennis courts at their residences. Not so most of the Africans, whose budgets are limited. <PERSON> Chad </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Mahammat </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Adoun </PERSON> said he would n't know what to do with a pool, anyway. `` I ca n't swim. My country is very dry,'' he said. Nonetheless, he appears in good shape, tall and well-muscled. `` I jog several rounds, then I hang on the bars _ have to exercise those pectorals and abdominals,'' he said. `` At home, it's too hot to exercise like this.'' At home, soccer is a national pastime. The African students do not appear intimidated by their distinguished opponents. The soccer game is for fun. No score is kept of winners or losers. `` Our health is the winner,'' said <PERSON> Kabore </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Another Push Begins to Help Rural America Come Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A lot of people say rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, with its wide-open spaces and small towns, is in trouble and needs a lift. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> says a modest infusion of federal funds, around $ 1.5 billion over five years, is a good place to start. The House is still working on its rural development plan. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has n't given details of what it supports, but there are hints. `` Establishing a rural development policy requires striking a balance between long-term strategies to improve rural economies and shorter term efforts to provide jobs and the infrastructure needed for long-term development and improved quality of life,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. However, he adds, national debt `` as the predominant constraint'' on federal spending puts a lid on how much the government can spend on domestic programs, including rural development. `` But even if funding were available, it is not clear that simply adding programs or funding would be helpful in solving rural economic problems,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> says. Rural development for decades has been a goal of every administration and most office-seekers and farm organizations. Pet programs have been promoted from time to time, but the national commitment has been varied and often fuzzy. An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> task force earlier this year reported to <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> on how to improve <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s rural development efforts. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s comments about `` striking a balance'' and federal spending were included in the report. The rural economy `` has difficulty keeping pace with national economic growth,'' it said. There are fundamental problems of being a rural community: small size, isolation, an unskilled work force and a lack of institutional support. `` Cyclical recovery alone will not solve rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s problems,'' the task force said `` Without structural adjustments to enhance its productive potential, the rural economy will continue to lag, and many more rural residents will be forced to leave their hometowns.'' The task force made a number of recommendations `` within current budgetary resources and without major organizational restructuring'' to improve the effectiveness of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> rural programs. `` <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> should begin by committing itself to rural development as a major departmental mission,'' the task force said. `` <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> should articulate a clear goal for rural development and base its policy decisions on this goal. It can also take steps to strengthen its capacity for effective and concerted program action.'' Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a long-time supporter of rural development, saw the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> give unanimous approval a month ago to his Rural Partnerships Act of 1989 `` Rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today is in trouble,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. `` Compared to the nation as a whole, rural unemployment and poverty are higher and economic opportunities are deteriorating. We can not have two <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> _ one, a land of opportunity and a second, rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ left behind.'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said his bill is aimed at helping rural people, an estimated 61 million Americans, including farmers, businessmen and workers, in 14,000 small towns and cities across every state. While agriculture is important, only 10 percent of rural Americans live and work on farms. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said the problems of farmers will be addressed specifically in the 1990 farm bill and other initiatives. The Rural Partnerships Act would provide federal dollars to be matched locally to create jobs and economic opportunity through local revolving funds. Through other programs, money would be used to help improve education and health care. Safe drinking water and waste disposal would be other objectives sought by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill. Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on conservation credit and rural development, held field hearings this summer and says legislation deserves a high priority English warns, however, that significant new spending in rural communities will be impossible, given the budget crunch. But he says that if programs are targeted, modernized and used to complement each other, rural communities can be given `` a real opportunity to prosper.'' There is some feeling in the House that rural development should be dealt with in legislation to replace the 1985 farm law, contrary to <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>'s plan for keeping the two separate. Regardless of the maneuvering, there is growing evidence that rural development as an issue is around to stay. An environmental group, <LOCATION> Renew </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said last week that `` thousands of miles of streams are polluted, pesticides continue to seep into groundwater, acid rain is changing the face of the forests, lakes and farmland, and litter is scattered over the countryside.'' In a report about `` communities at risk,'' the group said rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is changing and not for the better. <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Salina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, a non-profit research organization, said in the report's introduction that the countryside represents `` the vulnerable soft underbelly'' of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> society at large. `` The simple reality is that rural people are a dispersed minority with no political clout, marginal isolates rapidly becoming like Third World peoples,'' he said. `` And increasingly the landscapes on which they live take on a Third World appearance.''

 Japanese and West German companies that ordinarily advertise in weekly news magazines apparently do n't want their products associated with memories of blitzkriegs, gas chambers and death marches. Time magazine and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report said Tuesday that some advertisers pulled ads out of their special issues on the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II. Time and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> declined to identify the advertisers. But the World War II issues were noticeably lacking in ads from Japanese companies, which are heavy advertisers in the magazines. <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, whose special World War II coverage was limited to slightly more than two pages of book reviews in its Sept. 4 issue, had a normal amount of advertising from Japanese companies in the issue. West German companies do not advertise every week in any of the three newsweeklies, so it is difficult to determine whether any had pulled ads because of the cover stories in Time and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. Some of the ads that were pulled were switched to other issues of the magazines, said spokesmen for the magazines. `` The net of it was that we did lose some business,'' Time spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Spokesmen for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>'s Infiniti division and <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>'s Acura division, which frequently advertise in the magazines, said Tuesday that their absence from the World War II editions had nothing to do with the magazines Newsweeklies often notify advertisers when they plan articles that might embarrass them. For example, if a magazine is running a cover story on alcoholism it would warn liquor companies. `` We make it very clear that the story is going to run in any case, and I think that speaks well for editorial integrity,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> has a similar policy, spokeswoman <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kseniak </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> News has no ads from Japanese or West German companies in its Aug. 28-Sept. 4 double issue featuring stories on World War II Time's Aug. 28 issue on World War II carries a single Japanese ad, a two-page spread from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -RRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Federal regulators, as promised following the indictment of 46 futures brokers and traders, have come up with a package of reforms and now want to hear what the industry thinks. The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the futures industry, voted unanimously Tuesday to submit the proposed rules changes for public comment. The reform package, which includes increased surveillance on commodities exchange floors at the start and end of trading days, was proposed after 46 brokers and traders in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s futures exchanges were indicted Aug. 2 on fraud and racketeering charges. Those charges, stemming from a lengthy undercover federal probe of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, included allegations that traders cheated their customers through falsified records and pre-arranged trades. `` We support their efforts to address these issues,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` After a thorough review process earlier this year, our own board of governors approved a comprehensive set of rule enhancements that are very similar to what the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> proposed today.'' BOT President and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> said in a statement, `` We have not yet reviewed the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s new and proposed rules; however it appears that many of the recommendations are either already in place at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> or will soon be implemented.'' The markets themselves have proposed tighter trading rules and updated surveillance and auditing techniques to combat abuse. <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON> noted that both exchanges announced plans to develop an electronic surveillance system that will use hand-held computer terminals in the trading pits. He said the exchanges hope to have the new system developed within a year and `` with the adoption of these measures, we are confident that opportunities for the types of abuses raised in the indictments will be effectively eliminated.'' Critics have claimed the traditional `` open outcry'' system of trading, in which participants use shouts and hand signals to make transactions in crowded, hectic trading pits, makes it difficult to track and detect fraud. `` The commission is committed to take all necessary steps to protect the public confidence in these markets,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>. `` The action we are taking today will reinforce our regulatory system.'' The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> charges alleged that traders cheated customers by falsifying trading cards, which record purchase and sales information, or altering the time that trades were made to take advantage of price shifts in the market. Some brokers allegedly conspired with exchange members who trade only for their own accounts, known as locals, to finalize trades after the close of the market in order to illegally try to set a more advantageous price. In addition to tightening surveillance on the nation's commodity exchange floors, the package calls for: _ Easily identifiable trading cards with preprinted information that would allow regulators to reconstruct the sequence of a trade, an investigative practice known as following the audit trail _ Frequent collection, at least every 30 minutes and eventually every 15 minutes, of trading cards to reduce the potential for altering records to conceal illegal trading activity _ Preventing people with histories of rules violations from serving on the governing boards, disciplinary committees or arbitration panels of exchanges or registered futures associations `` All of these changes will help detect but also deter'' illegal trading, said Mrs. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> after the commission vote. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed changes are subject to comment by interested parties for the next 30 to 60 days before the commission can make its approval final. One element put into effect immediately was the creation of a pilot surveillance program. The Floor Surveillance Task Force will have responsibility for direct examination of trading cards and other trading records on the exchange floor. The pilot program is designed to enable the commission to determine its needs for a permanent floor surveillance program in the near future.

 Some major drug companies in effect said `` I told you so'' at the latest news of a troubled generic drug maker, but added that it was too early to tell the scope of problems among their Brand X rivals. `` You might expect that problems would eventuate,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Warner-Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Morris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>. Generic drug companies do n't have `` quite the same understanding of the long-term commitment to research integrity,'' he said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Hoffmann-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is `` concerned about the recent findings because they question the reliability of some generic drugs,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Oestreicher </PERSON>, spokesman for the Nutley-based company. `` It's a serious issue.'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> moved Monday to withdraw from the market a popular generic high-blood pressure medicine made by <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc It was the third such action aimed at a generic company in a week, shaking the $ 5-billion-a-year industry. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is investigating 11 drug makers following allegations of fraud and corruption involving employees of the agency's generic drug section and some generic drug companies. Generic drugs duplicate brand-name products whose patents have expired, and can cost up to 70 percent less. Some major drug makers also produce generic medicines, often versions of their own drugs whose patents expired. Other research-oriented pharmaceutical companies contacted Tuesday stayed out of the fray. `` We're not in the generic business and we're going to pass on this one,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Asinari </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Schering-Plough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>. Nor would <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarsky </PERSON> comment, though she did point out that the Rahway-based company's research and development budget for 1989 was $ 750 million. `` Our response to generic competition is we will continue to discover and develop innovative medicines,'' she said. Many of the companies said it was too early too tell how widespread problems were among the generics, or whether the brand-name companies would be affected. `` I think we're all waiting holding our breath, hoping that it is n't more widespread, because ultimately in the public perception it affects the whole industry,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. Analysts doubted the problems at generic drug makers would change their big brothers' strategy about entering or leaving the generic market, or make a difference to their bottom line. Analysts noted that the major profits in the research-driven drug business come from patented drugs.

<HEAD>NLRB Orders New Training Following Right to Work Committee Study</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has ordered its regional offices to provide new training to employees who handle inquiries about workers' rights, a move stemming from a study by an anti-union group that said the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> often provided inaccurate information. `` Please schedule additional training for all staff professionals who serve as information officers and ensure that only those who possess a sufficient level of experience are assigned to serve as information officers,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION>'s acting associate general counsel, said in a memo sent earlier this month to the agency's field directors. Stack also told the regional offices to determine whether <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> officers quoted in a recent report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Work </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had in fact provided the information attributed to them in the anti-union group's report. Stack declined comment when asked whether the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> agreed that some of its information officers had provided inaccurate information. But when asked why he ordered new training, he said: `` Anytime I find out that there is a need for training, the correct thing to do is see that the training is conducted.'' The Right to <ORGANIZATION> Work </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, in a study released this month, said <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> information officers often provided inaccurate information when questioned about employees' rights under a 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. In the decision, the high court ruled that employees hired by companies whose workforce is represented by unions can not be forced to join the union but can be required to pay dues to help pay the costs of negotiating and administering contracts. The court said workers could not be required to pay dues in excess of those amounts _ in effect allowing workers who disagree with the political activities of the union that represents them to withhold partial dues. The Right to <ORGANIZATION> Work </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said it hired a private investigator who telephoned 34 <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> offices in states that allow compulsory unionism and claimed to be an employee who had been recently hired and informed that he had to join a union and pay union dues. Information officers at 22 of the offices said workers could be required to pay full union dues, the group said in its study. When the survey was released earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> dismissed its findings and said: `` I would think it improbable that our field offices would not provide accurate information to an employee about what rights he has.'' But the next day, Aug. 10, <PERSON> Stack </PERSON> sent his memo to the regional directors ordering the additional training and an investigation into whether the Right to <ORGANIZATION> Work </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s account was accurate. During the training, Stack said, information officers should be given a copy of a November 1988 internal <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> memo outlining the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision, commonly referred to as the <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> decision after <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, the man who sued the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> for the right to withhold partial dues.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says he will reopen his panel's investigation of the failure of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, expected to require the government's largest-ever thrift rescue. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, branded the collapse of the thrift based in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a `` mini-Watergate.'' He said his committee had suspended its probe only because of the pressing need to pass emergency legislation bailing out the savings and loan industry. Now that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has passed the bill, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> vowed to clear up the scandal `` once and for all.'' Previously <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has criticized <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, for delaying regulatory action against <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and allowing the thrift's losses to balloon. The probe is sure to examine political contributions from <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the chairman of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s parent firm, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, to five senators who later met with regulators about <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. They are Sens. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, later returned <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> is under the control of the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the new agency created earlier this month to rescue and close the nation's insolvent thrift institutions. Analysts expect that <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> will be the costliest of more than 400 resolutions. `` We already know that at least $ 1.5 billion has been lost in the Lincoln fiasco with more to come as the mess is cleaned up,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said in a statement Monday. `` <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> remains a mini-Watergate in federal financial regulations and it is important that the public and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> know why it happened and specifically who was responsible,'' he said. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said the committee will also re-examine the spate of last-minute S & amp; L rescues conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> last December. And, he said, the panel will be overseeing the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>'s disposition of real estate, particularly in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where the savings and loan problem has been concentrated.

<HEAD>Regulators Urge Quick Decision on Selling Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has urged a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> utility to decide soon whether to sell or dismantle its <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, which voters said last June should close. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Murley </PERSON>, director of the commission's office of nuclear reactor regulation, told officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that uncertainty about the fate of the 913-megawatt plant was making it difficult to plan regulatory changes there. `` It does make it awkward to keep carrying these options for a long period of time,'' <PERSON> Murley </PERSON> told the officials in a meeting at <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. The unusual circumstances of the plant's forced shutdown has put it in `` uncharted waters,'' he said. Other commission staff members noted, for example, that they may need to know the plant's fate before deciding whether to approve the utility's plan for reducing its emergency staff or its request to be exempted from an on-site emergency exercise. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> must approve any transfer of the utility district's nuclear license to another operator, but it also must approve the various regulatory adjustments required in the event the plant is decommissioned and eventually dismantled <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, general manager of the utility district, assured <PERSON> Murley </PERSON> and other commission staff members that the question of whether to sell <ORGANIZATION> Rancho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seco </ORGANIZATION> would be resolved `` very soon.'' <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> said efforts to sell the 15-year-old plant probably will be abandoned if no agreement is reached by Friday with <ORGANIZATION> Quadrex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` I do not see anyone else coming forward ... to continue this process,'' of negotiating to buy the plant, <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> said, adding later that he was `` cautiously optimistic'' that a deal could be worked out this week with <ORGANIZATION> Quadrex </ORGANIZATION>. The Rancho Seco station has been shut down since June 7, the day after utility district residents voted against keeping the plant running. It was the first time an operating nuclear power plant was closed by voter initiative. The vote did not explicitly prohibit the utility from selling the plant, and a buyer such as <ORGANIZATION> Quadrex </ORGANIZATION> could be allowed to run it if the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> approves a license transfer. Under such circumstances, <ORGANIZATION> Quadrex </ORGANIZATION> would have to restart the reactor. If a deal is struck with <ORGANIZATION> Quadrex </ORGANIZATION>, and arrangements are set for the utility to buy back some of the power generated by <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION>, then the district's board of directors would vote on it Sept. 7, <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> said. Any proposed sale would be put to a public vote, tentatively scheduled for Dec. 12. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> and other officials of the utility also told the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> they were offering key workers special severance agreements in order to keep them from quitting. Licensed operators, for example, are being assured they will get the equivalent of six months salary in the event they are laid off _ money they would n't get if they resigned.

 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' new owners should be able to repay the carrier's $ 3.1 billion debt with cash from its operations, including income from sale-leaseback arrangements on aircraft, congressional auditors say. Through 1993, the airline will have at least $ 635 million a year left over after servicing its debt and paying taxes, according to an analysis by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, prepared the report for the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee, Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., who planned a hearing this fall on the sale of the airline's parent company, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to a group led by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> The leveraged buyout will give <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> one of the highest debt loads in the industry, and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> is investigating the sale to determine whether it will compromise the carrier's safety. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who could ground the <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, - based airline if he believes it is unsafe, is expected to finish his investigation next month <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> filed documents with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> saying he expects to repay the carrier's debt through cash flow from its operations. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report said its analysis shows the claim `` appears to be true.'' For 1989, the airline would have $ 1.8 billion in cash available, including $ 364 million in income from operations and $ 834 million from selling aircraft and then leasing them back. After servicing debt, paying taxes and meeting other expenses, the airline would have $ 166 million left over, according to the report. By 1993, the company is projected to have income of $ 2.1 billion, including $ 570 million in revenue from the sale-leaseback arrangements. After debt payments and other expenses the airline would have excess cash of $ 635 million, according to the report. The airline could cover any cash shortfalls by selling Japanese real estate it owns or drawing on a $ 250 million line of credit, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The report confirms what the airline has been saying about the buyout in public statements and government filings, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON>, a spokesman for the carrier, said Tuesday. `` We're committed to continuing to grow the airline, to continue making it more and more competitive and to handle the debt load brought on by the purchase in a prudent business manner,'' <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> said. However, the new debt `` weakens <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s financial ratios and creates lower income due to higher interest payments,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The overseers of the new agency created to dismantle failed savings institutions have given regulators permission to get started on big, complex deals. But the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Oversight Board, headed by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, said Tuesday the overseers still want to be consulted before regulators give final approval to complex transactions. The policy directive, issued by the oversight board after a private, telephone conference, was the latest salvo in the squabbling between bank regulators in charge of handling failed S & amp; Ls and the administration officials who control the purse strings. The law signed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Aug. 9 authorized $ 50 billion in spending on failed S & amp; Ls and created a two-tier bureaucracy for handling the work. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an independent regulatory agency, got control of the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>, which is doing the disposal work. But <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s oversight board, which also includes <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> and Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, sets the policies governing how the $ 50 billion is to be spent. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> has been chafing under the arrangement. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said regulators have been ready to put five multi-billion-dollar institutions up for sale, but have had to delay action, driving up the ultimate cost of the S & amp; L crisis. Regulators held off because the oversight board directed them to complete only relatively simple transactions until it decides, probably within several weeks, on a policy for disposal techniques for large institutions. So far, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> has closed 11 small S & amp; Ls, transferring their deposits to other institutions or paying off customers directly. But it has not tackled the kind of large deals that require the government to issue guarantees or assume part ownership of a rescued S & amp; L. Oversight board spokesman <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddon </PERSON> said the policy was revised Tuesday to point out that `` simple does not mean small'' and that regulators can get started on complex deals. Members of the congressional banking committees, who are on vacation until after Labor Day, are expressing concern about the intramural squabbling, saying they intended that the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> would be able to move swiftly without undue restrictions. In a second move, the oversight board told the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> to make disposing of failed S & amp; Ls its first priority. After that, it should be ready to deploy funds to resolve depositor runs. The third priority is replacing high-cost deposits with low-cost government funds. The insertion of the second priority effectively replaces arrangements made early this year under which the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and regional <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> agreed jointly to pump cash into any institutions suffering liquidity problems.

 <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock jumped 12 percent on Tuesday as speculation surfaced that the parent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> had retained two investment firms to help defend it against unwanted takeovers.

More than 3.86 million shares changed hands, the third most active stock traded on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday. Other transportation stocks also increased in what analysts said was anticipation of continued takeover activity in the industry. The Dow Jones Transportation Average, which includes AMR and six other airlines in its 20 stocks, finished up 13.69 at 1,506.58, the fourth consecutive record close. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, object of $ 275 per share, or $ 6.19 billion, takeover bid by investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, closed down $ 4.25 at $ 277.25, but other airline companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> were up on various exchanges. Transportation stocks have been actively traded in the wake of <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' bid for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, plus the recent buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>. `` The latest fad is airline takeovers,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an industry consultant in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` They have substantial assets sitting out there which makes them good takeover targets.

<HEAD>Federal Express Ads Reflect Global Reach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, mapping its foray into global competition in air cargo transportation, has dropped the fast-talking, humorous advertising campaign which promised to deliver packages `` absolutely, positively overnight.'' The <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> company that dominates the nation's overnight market instead has adopted new, documentary-style television commercials touting safety, reliability and technical expertise. The change is part of the company's effort to expand internationally and become the world's leading transportation company. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> merged on Aug. 7 with international air freight carrier <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, through which it acquired an air cargo network of 119 countries. Analysts say the Flying Tiger acquisition has given <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> two sets of customers: businesses to which it sells services directly, and freight forwards, which buy services for resale to shippers. Flying <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> sold its heavy freight service primarily through freight forwarders. And the analysts say a change in the company's advertising approach is only natural given <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>' expanded clientele. `` You are not going to sell the heavyweight business the same way you sell an overnight letter,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keegan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. `` With an overnight letter, you are dealing with an individual who may be relatively unsophisticated. Someone shipping heavy freight is going to be sophisticated. I do n't think you are going to sell to those kind of people with a funny ad,'' <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoenfeld </PERSON>, vice president of international marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, said the company's marketing focus will continue to shift from next-day delivery to reliability. `` ` Absolutely, positively overnight' really is not a message that's available to us internationally simply because some things just ca n't be overnight,'' <PERSON> Shoenfeld </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shoenfeld </PERSON> cites one selling point as the fact that <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> flies its own aircraft to 30 international airports instead of relying primarily on cargo space in passenger airlines as competitors do. `` When all of the integration has taken place ... I think we will see <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> become the global standard,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, as a newcomer in the heavyweight freight business, faces stiff competition from a host of new competitors including <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arch-rival, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, announced on Monday plans to expand its package delivery service to 175 countries and territories. It also is planning a new ad campaign promoting its worldwide service.

<HEAD>Canadian Partnership Raises Hostile Bid in Dunkin' Donuts Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Canadian partnership has raised its hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> Dunkin </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Donuts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to $ 308 million despite a lawsuit pending in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Chancery Court, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Kingsbridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> officials, partners in <ORGANIZATION> DD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday they had raised their bid from $ 43 to $ 45 a share, regardless of how the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> judge rules in the trial that begins Sept. 11. Unless extended, the offer expires Sept. 15, the Toronto-based partnership said. `` The offer is there and is n't contingent on success in court,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Kingsbridge </LOCATION> associate director. He said <ORGANIZATION> DD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> would continue its bid if the court finds <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts was within its rights when it set up a series of tough defenses, including an employee stock ownership plan, which holds about 16 percent of its outstanding common shares. The company also has a shareholder rights plan, or `` poison pill,'' designed to increase the number of shares in the event of a takeover, making a merger prohibitively expensive. And it has sold $ 28 million of preferred stock, convertible to an 11 percent stake in the company, to an avowedly friendly investor, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We think we have a very good case in court and that the court will find that those measures were improperly put in place. But even if they were n't, we'll still continue with the bid,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. He said the offer was, however, valid only if 50.1 percent of <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts' common shares were tendered on a fully diluted basis. The board of directors at <ORGANIZATION> Dunkin </ORGANIZATION>' Donuts said in a prepared statement Tuesday that a meeting `` to evaluate the revised tender offer with the assistance of the company's outside legal and financial advisors'' would be scheduled.

The doughnut shop chain reported earnings for the three months ended July 29 of $ 2.1 million or 24 cents a share on revenue of $ 30.3 million, compared with earnings of $ 3.2 million or 49 cents a share on revenue of $ 29.2 million. For the nine months ended July 29, <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts reported earnings totaled $ 7.62 million or $ 1.08 a share on revenue of $ 89.7 million, down 22.7 percent from $ 9.86 million or $ 1.49 a share on revenue of $ 82.4 million for the same period a year ago.

 Consumer advocates and physicians say there's no reason to doubt the safety and effectiveness of most generic drugs, and consumers appear to be heeding that advice `` I do n't think there's panic in the streets. I think they're concerned,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, editor of the trade publication Drug Store News-Inside Pharmacy, referring to drug consumers <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, who has been visiting pharmacies in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> for the past week, said Monday he saw few customers switching from a generic to a brand-name drug. `` As far as we know there is no problem with safety at this time and no problem that is one that would make people stop taking generic drugs,'' Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said today. `` If you are concerned, see your physician, but do n't switch without really checking with someone first,'' he said on `` CBS This Morning.'' Disclosures of fraud and corruption in the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s generic drug division have tainted the agency's reputation and cast doubts on the industry as well as the safety and efficacy of generic medicines. `` We are just as shocked, dismayed and angry as I think consumers are with the despicable events that were perpetrated by a few generic companies,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said, adding that `` we're not going to rest until this is cleaned up.'' Young's assurances of the safety of generics echoed those of other physicians and consumer advocates. `` At the present time, there's no evidence that any generic drugs out there in the pharmacies lack safety or effectiveness,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON>, a trustee of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> who is also an internist at the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> and a clinical pharmacologist, agreed. `` What we've seen in the past few weeks is regrettable, but I do n't think it reflects all generics and it really has n't changed my prescribing habits,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON> said, most physicians already insist on brand-name drugs for certain hard-to-treat conditions, such as congestive heart failure. `` There does n't seem to be a surge of phone calls or people bringing back bags of drugs,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Krahulec </PERSON>, vice president of government affairs for Rite Aid, the nation's largest drugstore chain. <PERSON> Krahulec </PERSON> said his chain was surveying its nearly 2,300 stores to gauge public reaction to the scandal enveloping the generic drug industry, but `` no one has called in with panic information.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has initiated steps in the past month to pull from the market products manufactured by several generic drug companies. In the latest move, the agency said Monday it wants to remove <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s generic version of Dyazide, a popular drug used to treat high blood pressure The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said it found no evidence of fraud. The Copiague, N.Y.-based <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION>, which says it will appeal within the 30-day limit, said the problem stems from confusion over a clerical error in identification of samples used in safety tests. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> also has expanded federal inspections of 11 generic drug makers to include the plants of 20 additional generic companies and is reviewing 30 of the most commonly used generic drugs. The main question raised about the drugs is whether they work as effectively as the brand-name drug _ whether they are absorbed into the body at the same rate as the drug they mimic. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said potency problems were rarely of any significance. In most cases, he said, doctors prescribe the same dose of medicine for a 125-pound adult as for a 250-pound adult. `` For most drugs, there is a wide range over which the drug will be effective and safe,'' he said. `` This cuts through a lot of the extent to which people are overreacting to the problems that have been brought to light.'' Generic drugs are copies of brand-name medicines and are usually much less expensive. A third of all prescriptions written in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are filled with generic drugs, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Generic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

 The stock market got off to a tentative start today in the wake of Tuesday's retreat led by program trading. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 0.38 to 2,726.25 at 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Declining issues held a slim lead over advancing ones on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 467 down, 459 up and 526 unchanged.

The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 0.20 to 194.67. Wall Street analysts attributed the selling Tuesday to strategies aimed at profiting from the price differences between stocks and futures based on stock price indices.

<HEAD>Franchisees Offer $200 Million Buyout of Fast Food Chain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of eight franchisees said today it has offered more than $ 200 million in cash to buy <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION>'s fast food chain from <ORGANIZATION> DWG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the holding company controlled by industrialist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>. The group, calling itself R.B. <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said it made the offer Aug. 1 in a letter to <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, who has so far not responded to the proposal. In a letter to fellow franchisees, also released today, the group said <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s legal and financial problems could threaten the future of Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> pleaded no contest in 1987 to federal income tax evasion and was sentenced last year to five years probation on the condition that he pay all his back taxes, penalties and interest, the cost of prosecuting his case and create a $ 3 million homeless fund. `` We think it is very unlikely that <PERSON> Arby </PERSON>'s could remain unaffected by all these pressures on Mr. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> DWG </ORGANIZATION>,'' the letter to the franchisees said. <ORGANIZATION> DWG </ORGANIZATION>, a Miami-based holding company, controls <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the marketing, franchising and service company for the 2,100-store <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant chain.

A secretary at the chain's <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> headquarters said President and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was in a meeting this morning. The franchisees, who together operate more than 500 Arby's roast beef restaurants, said their offer represents three times what Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> DWG </ORGANIZATION> paid for the chain in 1984 as part of its acquisition of Royal Crown Cola Companies. <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION>'s reported total revenue of $ 153.8 million and an operating profit of $ 20.7 million in 1988.

 Corn futures prices climbed, wheat prices dipped and soybeans were mixed in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. The tone was negative in all the pits, however, falling under the influence of a bearish weather forecast, analysts said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s forecast for the month of September calls for normal temperatures and rain across the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, lessening the chance for an early frost that would curb harvest yields. The corn harvest is a month away. Traders saw that forecast, and one calling for more rain in the region by the end of the week, as negative. But analysts said corn traders bought on reports that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is looking to buy half a million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn. In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1 cent lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.83 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 1 cent higher with September at $ 2.32 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower, with September at $ 1.33 a bushel; and soybeans were 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher, with September at $ 5.81 -LCB- a bushel.

<HEAD>Personal Income, Consumer Spending, Climb at Healthy Pace</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Adds 2 grafs with total figures for spending and income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Personal incomes rose a healthy 0.7 percent in July, the best gain in four months, while consumer spending climbed at its fastest pace in three months, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that consumer spending rose 0.7 percent in July. It was the best gain since a 1.2 percent rise in April and followed a much weaker 0.2 percent June increase. The 0.7 percent rise in personal incomes followed a 0.5 percent June increase and was the fastest advance since a 1 percent increase in March. The statistics on Americans' income growth and spending habits provided fresh evidence that the economy is not in danger of toppling into a recession. The report showed that consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity, is being bolstered by healthy gains in income. Just a month ago, economists were not as certain about the state of the economy. However, a string of government statistics since that time have shown that the economy, and in particular the consumer sector, is not as weak as earlier feared. Last month, the government reported that consumer spending, after removing the effects of inflation, had declined in both May and June. But in today's report, the inflation-adjusted figures were revised upward to show modest increases of 0.1 percent in both May and June. On Tuesday, the government significantly revised upward its estimate of total economic growth, showing that the gross national product was growing at a healthy annual rate of 2.7 percent in the April-June quarter instead of the anemic 1.7 percent GNP rate originally reported. Most of that revision stemmed from the fact that the rate of consumer spending was doubled from what the government originally estimated. Today's report showed that consumer spending continued strong going into the first month of the July-September quarter. Many economists have been busy revising upward their estimates for overall economic growth this year, pushing their forecasts closer to the 2.9 percent GNP target set by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The July report showed that Americans' income after taxes also rose 0.7 percent in July, down slightly from a 0.8 percent after-tax increase in June. With incomes growing at the same rate as spending in July, Americans' savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable income, held steady at 5.7 percent. This is the highest level for savings since a 6.2 percent rate in March. The key component of the income category, wages and salaries, increased $ 25.4 billion in July, up substantially from a $ 17.6 billion June increase. This advance occurred despite the fact that payrolls at manufacturing companies rose by only $ 1.4 billion, down from a June increase of $ 2.9 billion. On the spending side, the $ 25.4 billion rise in personal consumption spending, which includes everything except interest payments on debt, compared to a $ 6.6 billion June advance. Purchases of durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, increased $ 7.6 billion, up sharply from a $ 2.6 billion June increase. Purchases of nondurable goods increased $ 4.6 billion, compared to a small $ 200 million decline in June. Purchases of services, which includes housing costs, increased $ 13.2 billion, compared to a June increase of $ 4.2 billion. Overall, personal consumption spending came in at an annual rate of $ 3.48 trillion in July, following a revised level of $ 3.46 trillion in June. Personal incomes totaled $ 4.50 trillion at an annual rate in July, following a revised $ 4.42 trillion in June.

 With one day to go before directors of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> face a deadline for responding to a $ 6.19 billion takeover offer, the unions representing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' largest worker groups are scrambling to protect their interests. Suitor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a day after meeting with representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday he wo n't ask for labor concessions from <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s unions, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> issued a statement saying that Monday's talks with the flight attendants in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> conclude the first round of talks between his group and the unions. It was the first admission by <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> that he has met with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots' union, whose approval is considered crucial to any takeover, the newspaper reported. Meantime, leaders of the pilots' union opened a two-day meeting Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where they reportedly were discussing the possibility of participating in a management buyout of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company. The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which represents <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s largest worker group, met Friday with <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> billionaire who is seeking to buy <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, to spell out the expectations of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s mechanics and technical workers should they support his bid And <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants have urged <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board to resume contract negotiations, saying that in the event of an auction, the airline will be more valuable with settled contracts. The talks recently broke down after about two years. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has given <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board until Thursday to respond to his $ 275-a-share offer, which he raised from $ 240 a share on Aug. 16. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> meeting of leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> was believed to be focused on the maneuvering for control of the nation's second-largest airline, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` They're dealing with all this takeover stuff and its impact on the pilots but I could n't give you any specifics on what is going to be discussed,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that representatives of the pilots union and Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> had spent the weekend putting together a package to present to the United chapter's 27-member master executive council. Pilot leaders and <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> officials reportedly have met several times in the three weeks since <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' initial offer was revealed to discuss an employee-management buyout or a recapitalization that would put enough stock in an employee stock ownership plan to fend off a hostile takeover attempt. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots have been seeking an ownership role in the airline since 1987. Industry analysts have speculated that management might invite employees to join in a buyout of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for contract concessions that could end long-running labor disputes between the company and its pilots and flight attendants unions. Without the support of the flight attendants and Machinists, the pilots might have to assume a heavier financial burden, in the form of deeper contract concessions. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> represents most of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s 6,300 pilots. The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents another 12,700 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> workers, has urged the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board to proceed with caution. In a letter to the board last week, the attendants called for a resumption of contract talks. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 25,000 of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s 70,000 employees, said last Friday in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board that they would `` vigorously oppose'' any buyout or restructuring of the company. But the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, the adviser to the Machinists, met Friday with <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and outlined what the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> would expect if they supported his bid. Representatives of the flight attendants and the Machinists did not return calls Tuesday.

<DATELINE>BORDEAUX, France (AP) </DATELINE>

 The grape harvest in the <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION> wine region has begun several weeks earlier than usual because of hot, dry weather, and growers predict an exceptionally good vintage. <PERSON> Jean-Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Delmas </PERSON>, director of Chateau Haut-Brion, said picking of grapes destined for white wines began Tuesday in his vineyards, with the red wine harvest likely to start later in the week. `` I can assure you, at least if it does n't rain, that the 1989 vintage will be the greatest in the century,'' <PERSON> Delmas </PERSON> said. He said it was the first time since 1893 that the harvest has opened before Sept. 1 at Chateau Haut-Brion. Because conditions can differ markedly even between nearby vineyards, the harvest starts at varying times. The hot and dry conditions that lead to early harvest give the grapes an unusually high sugar level. They are likely to produce a comparatively small amount of wine but of very high quality, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Interprofessional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of the Wines of <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> HAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Hawaiian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, has signed a definitive agreement for its sale to an investment group that includes former baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>. The investment group, however, said Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> HAL </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Magoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> must tender nearly all of his controlling interest for a proposed takeover to go through. The group, headed by former airline executive <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, plans to purchase 51 percent of <ORGANIZATION> HAL </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding stock _ about 1.2 million shares in all. It offered $ 22 a share for each share of common stock, making the deal worth about $ 21.9 million. <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON> was a key member of a Ueberroth-led group that attempted to acquire strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. In a news release about the <ORGANIZATION> HAL </ORGANIZATION> deal, the group said 1.1 million shares must come from <PERSON> Magoon </PERSON> and other HAL officers and directors. <PERSON> Magoon </PERSON> owns a controlling interest in the company with more than 1 million shares. The agreement, already approved by <ORGANIZATION> HAL </ORGANIZATION>'s directors, is subject to approval by government agencies and shareholders, and the airline's unions HAL has scheduled a stockholders meeting for Oct. 19 to obtain the required shareholder approval. Shareholders of record as of Sept. 5 will be eligible to vote. HAL lost $ 13 million in the first half of this year and has lost a total of $ 30.6 million over the past 2 -LCB- years. <ORGANIZATION> Hawaiian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s largest inter-island airline, also serves <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> points.

 Oilman and takeover strategist <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said today he will not run for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> governor because he could not give all his attention to the state's problems. `` I ca n't make that commitment at this stage in my life,'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said. `` I've decided without regrets that I have other challenges and other responsibilities.'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> made the disclosure to about 500 people at a Rotary luncheon. He said he must devote full attention to his business. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, 61, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amarillo </ORGANIZATION>, signed a contract on a $ 2 million home in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> area earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. His firm's financial division also is moving from <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION> to downtown <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Although <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said the moves were for business and not political reasons, he also said he faced some business problems that could block his path in a race for governor. His partnership announced a $ 13.4 million loss for the second quarter of 1989 and he said today the company will likely post a loss in the third quarter. `` <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> will weather the tough times, but I have a responsibility to my shareholders to see this through,'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> initially said he would announce a decision by Aug. 15, then later delayed that announcement until the end of the month. Republicans who have announced for governor so far are <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> oilman-businessman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rains </PERSON>, who was secretary of state until resigning this summer, Railroad Commissioner <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>, and oilman <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has met with <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> in an effort to persuade the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer to buy <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a Trump associate said Wednesday `` Mr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> have spoken,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON>, president of Trump Shuttle, which the developer purchased from <LOCATION> Lorenzo </LOCATION> last June for $ 365 million. But <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has concerns about a potential purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON> said, noting that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is concerned about <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 2.5 billion debt, its small cash reserves and the need to refurbish many of its planes. While <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> remains interested and believes his name would help the Houston-based carrier win passengers, he has not been convinced that the risks are acceptable, <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` His -LRB- <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s -RRB- concerns are well put,'' said <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> official. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was unavailable for comment Wednesday, a spokesman said. Art Kent, a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> had no comment on the matter. In talks with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, said to have been held over the past month, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said his negative image has hurt <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, according to sources quoted in Wednesday's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> announced last Thursday that Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest airline company, may consider selling a minority or controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Strikebound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s other airline subsidiary, apparently would not be involved in any <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> transaction. Last week, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that one reason he was considering selling a stake in <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> was that the bitter struggle with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions had hurt traffic at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> is also involved in talks about selling a major stake in <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> to Scandinavian Airlines System and an unidentified partner, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the report. <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> already has a 9.9 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> as part of a joint marketing agreement. Sources were quoted by the Times as saying that <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was impressed with the way traffic on the former <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shuttle </ORGANIZATION> in the Northeast picked up since <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> bought it. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s share of the lucrative <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle market, split with <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, has `` approximately doubled since we took over,'' <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON> said. Although he declined to give precise figures, he said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuttle </PERSON>'s market share has jumped from around 25 percent when it started operations in early June to about 50 percent currently. `` I think being separated from Eastern is a positive; having the Trump name is a positive; having better service is a positive,'' <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON> said. But rival <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> disputed Nobles' estimate of current market share. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shuttle </ORGANIZATION>'s share, at around 75 percent when <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> started up, is now holding at roughly 60 percent `` We're quite pleased with the clientele that we think we've been able to keep since they started,'' she said. The Times quoted its sources as saying that <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> favored a deal with <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> involving <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> board member <PERSON> Kaj </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikast </PERSON> said Tuesday that the carrier was not near a decision on taking a stake in <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. Ikast told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> there have been talks with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> about buying such a stake.

 <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, flush with cash, said Wednesday it was raising its dividend 22.2 percent and splitting its shares 4 for 1 The world's largest consumer products company makes more profit than it can reasonably reinvest in its businesses, so it gives the rest to shareholders in higher dividends. Since its stock price keeps rising, it has to lower the price periodically through share splits to make a standard lot of 100 shares more affordable to small investors. New York-based <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> makes cigarettes and owns <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. It earned $ 1.34 billion on revenue of $ 22.4 billion in the first half of the year. The 4-for-1 stock split means shareholders will own four shares for each one they have now. The extra shares will be distributed Oct. 10 to shareholders of record on Sept. 15. The dividend increase will raise annual dividends to $ 5.50 per share on a pre-split basis, or $ 1.37 -LCB- per new share. Quarterly dividends have been increased 25 times in the last 22 years. Including the latest split, one share in 1966 will have turned into 192 shares by October.

 <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that it will take $ 100 million less than the expected $ 1.225 billion for its psychiatric company, the largest <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> unit for sale to help finance the company's management-led takeover. <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> executives said in March, when shareholders voted to sell the company for $ 3.6 billion, that subsidiaries would be sold to repay a $ 1.3 billion bridge loan due in two years. `` We are ahead of schedule of our repayment of the bridge loan,'' <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> said. The company said in a news release that it has received senior loan financing commitments and other financing details involved in selling <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. Psychiatric company executives and an employee stock ownership plan support the sale. While <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> will accept the lower purchase price, it will retain ownership of $ 150 million in the psychiatric company's common stock and preferred stock along with warrants to buy additional shares of common stock. Officials said $ 650 million in financing will be provided by <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> also will buy $ 60 million of the psychiatric company's senior discount notes. <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will arrange the placement of debt and preferred stock of HPC for $ 530 million, accounting for the rest of the financing. Financing still has to be approved by <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION>'s board with closing expected to be completed by the end of the year. The psychiatric company owns 52 facilities with about 5,500 beds. <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> owns 78 medical-surgical hospitals with more than 18,000 beds in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in March that the company would likely sell its psychiatric division, its management company and its international division to held finance the leveraged buyout. In a leveraged buyout, the assets of the company are used as collateral to borrow money needed to purchase the company. Such a transaction usually increases the company's debt substantially. Sale of <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> already was being considered when the merger was approved March 15. At the time, <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> said he wanted to streamline <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> to get back to the basic business of owning and managing hospitals.

 The stock market turned lower this afternoon as program trading wiped out most earlier gains. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which was up 12.73 points at noon on Wall Street, was down 9.30 at 2,717.33 two hours later.

 In a small corner room at the World Trade Center, an elite group of people with gifted taste buds, speedy slurps and an appreciation of caffeine gather for a special mission: to decide the fate of billions of beans. Equipped with cups, silver spittoons and freshly roasted brew that would shame any doughnut shop, the tasters judge whether coffee grown in 46 countries meets the standards of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION>, Sugar & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. It's a job that has become more important because of the suspension of coffee export limits this summer, which resulted in a flood of beans pouring into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the world's biggest coffee market. Rejection could mean huge losses for importers and brokers, particularly now that producers ca n't rely on the agreement to sell their coffee beans and therefore must compete on quality. Though the rejected coffee is n't discarded, it may sit longer in a warehouse, could be sold at a discount or end up as a roasted blend or generic-brand instant, the coffee equivalent of an old horse sent to the glue factory. On this particular day, about $ 2 million worth of coffee _ or nearly 2.5 million pounds _ is at stake. But there were periods in the last two years when all was quiet in what's known in coffee parlance as `` the grading room.'' `` There was absolutely nothing going on for 4 to 5 months, nothing, zero,'' says <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Garnes </PERSON>, grading room assistant at the exchange where coffee, sugar and cocoa contracts are traded. Coffee sold quickly in those days because of export quotas set by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the cartel of producers that artificially determined prices through limiting the supply. Tight supplies and high demand meant that a lot of coffee bypassed the exchange and went directly to brokers or roasters. With more beans to judge these days the tasters must slurp more mouthfuls of coffee. Since they're paid by the number of bags tested, their take has increased to about $ 630 for nearly two hours' work, which amounts to more than $ 12 a slurp During normal periods they earn about $ 200. On July 4 the <ORGANIZATION> ICO </ORGANIZATION> temporarily suspended export ceilings that had kept wholesale prices at between $ 1.20 and $ 1.40 a pound. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> roasters had criticized the quotas for limiting access to quality coffee. With coffee pouring into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, prices have tumbled nearly 40 percent and made it a buyers market. Further depressing prices is the normal slow summer roasting period, a long-term decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coffee consumption and efforts by producers to empty warehouses before the new harvest starting in September. `` If the market is already at these levels in anticipation of new crops what will happen when the new crop actually comes?,'' says <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, industry analyst with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Retail prices also have fallen Two of the biggest roasters, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which have about 65 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coffee market, announced big price cuts Aug. 7. General Foods, which markets <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Sanka </LOCATION> coffees, said it dropped the average price it charges retailers 23 cents a pound for ground roasted coffee. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, marketer of Folgers, lowered its price by 20 cents to about $ 2.50 a pound. There's not much talking in the grading room as the testers judge the coffee first by color and grade, or purity. Working in teams of three they sort through pans of small green coffee beans for imperfections _ brown, black, rotten or faded beans. Dirt and other impurities count against the batch. Every five bad beans, or one black bean, equals one imperfection. Fifteen imperfections disqualifies the entire lot. Color also is important because as coffee ages it loses moisture and fades, says taster <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Colten </PERSON>, quality control manager for <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> coffee importers. <PERSON> Colten </PERSON> and the 26 other graders, including two women recently added to the erstwhile male group, leave jobs or other activities to grade coffee. Each pan, representing one 37,500-pound lot, is numbered so the testers know only the country of origin. `` We work blind so nothing biases our opinion,'' says <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, former senior buyer for <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Knowing the country is important because shades of color differ as do acidity and flavor, tasters say Coffees with earthy, fermenty characteristics passable for one country's coffees would n't be for another. A tantalizing aroma fills the room as the beans are thrown into old-fashioned roasters for browning over an open flame. The beans are then ground and steeped in boiling water in preparation for tasting, the ultimate proving ground. With a loud slurp <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlegelmilch </PERSON> sucks in a spoonful of brew, twirls it around his tongue and spits into a silver spittoon near his feet. Quickly adjusting the swivel-top table he brings the next cup into position, breaks through the film of grounds atop the liquid, scoops another mouthful and repeats the ritual. In a matter of seconds he has tasted 21 cups. Body, the right twinge of acidity and a good `` bouquet'' or aroma are important. But tasters look for `` negative rather than positive characteristics,'' says <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Colten </PERSON>, a former executive with <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aron </PERSON>, who believes coffee tasting is `` a very unique art.'' Anything `` off odor,'' _ a dirty, groundy or musty smell _ or that tastes too acidic, leathery, fermented, medicinal or earthy is rejected. This day, a Mexican coffee that has already passed color and grade tests is rejected on taste. <PERSON> Garnes </PERSON> calls the importer, who requests a second opinion. Three more tasters are asked to judge the brew. It passes on second tasting. The testers, all current or retired coffee-industry executives, are purists about coffee outside the grading room, too. Some are so choosy they wo n't buy coffee already roasted, much less ground. Several buy raw beans and roast them at home. `` Anyone in the coffee business is very picky about their coffee,'' says <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Colten </PERSON>. As for the latest fad _ flavored coffee, which is marinated in liquid flavorings ranging from cinnamon to coconut _ the tasters turn up their noses. `` It's adulterated,'' says one. `` No one grows cinnamon nut flavored coffee,'' says another. `` If you get a good cup of coffee you do n't need flavorings. You do n't even need cream or sugar.

 The stock market posted modest losses this afternoon, recovering from a selloff that wiped out many of today's earlier gains The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 1.14 at 2,725.49 at 3 p.m. on Wall Street. The average, which sported a gain of 12.73 points at noon, had been down 9.30 at 2 p.m. Declining issues outnumbered advances on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 730 down, 670 up and 525 unchanged.

Futures-related program selling hit the market this afternoon and temporarly knocked down share prices but they managed to bob back up.

<TEXT>
 Wheat futures prices dipped while corn and soybeans were mixed in trading Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. With little news to affect the market, traders sold on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-day forecast that predicts normal temperatures and rain for the month of September. The forecast dims any talk of an early frost that would curb harvest yields. The corn harvest is a month away. In addition, more rain is expected to move into the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> by the end of the week, adding further downward pressure to prices, analysts said. Corn futures rose early in the session on reports that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is looking to buy half a million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, but quickly fell under the negative weather influences. At the close of trading, wheat was -RCB- cent to 2 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.83 -RCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with September at $ 2.32 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents lower with September at $ 1.32 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents lower to 2 cents higher, with September at $ 5.82 -LCB- a bushel.

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it has named marine scientist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> as a director, in response to shareholder demands for the addition of an environmental expert following the nation's worst oil spill. <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>, 62, is president and a senior scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. He also will serve on the board's newly formed public issues committee, which will monitor the company's environmental policies `` This is a good day for the environment and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> shareholders,'' said <PERSON> Comptroller </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON>, trustee for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s employee, firefighter and police pension funds. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was one of several pension funds with large holdings of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> stock that has publicized its dissatisfaction with the oil giant's handling of the March 24 spill and cleanup effort. The funds, which included <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Public Employee Retirement System, the largest individual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public pension fund, had called for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to appoint a director with expertise and interest in the environment. <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> said the appointment `` demonstrates environmental and social responsibility'' in the aftermath of the disaster in which the tanker Exxon Valdez hit a charted reef and spewed millions of gallons of oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. In a telephone interview from his office in <LOCATION> Woods </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, about 70 miles south of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on the southeast end of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> spoke of the spill. `` I think it's a terrible tragedy and a major disaster not just for the animals but for the people in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> said. He declined to comment on <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of the cleanup but said he would visit <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in about two weeks for a separate scientific meeting on arctic research and would view the remnants of the spill at that time. `` It will give me an opportunity to discuss these research and scientific questions with colleagues in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> will serve on the board until <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s annual shareholder's meeting next April, when his name will be submitted for shareholder approval along with the other directors, said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> At the company's annual shareholders last May, shareholders demanded changes in what they called <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s `` inadequate state of preparedness'' for dealing with future problems. Although the funds ultimately voted for management this year, they warned of a major shareholder revolt next year if the Exxon appointment was unsatisfactory to dissident shareholders. At the May meeting, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> management agreed to create the six-member public issues committee, which includes four non-Exxon employees. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said the committee would review the corporation's `` policies, programs and practices on public issues of significance including their effects on the environment and worker safety and health. <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>'s appointment increases the size of the Exxon board to 15, including ten non-employee directors. Born in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>'s career includes 26 years at the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>.

 If you're looking for an unfinished luxury home with no utilities but such extras as graffiti declaring `` Led Zeppelin Rules,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> has just the place for you. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> and an army of bureaucrats like him are ready to deal. They work for the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an agency created Aug. 9 when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed legislation bailing out the savings and loan industry. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, 55, manages <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> thrift institution with $ 1.6 billion in assets and $ 600 million in red ink. Along with others working for the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>, he's trying to sell thousands of repossessed properties the government is inheriting from as many as 600 failed thrift institutions. The properties range from run-of-the-mill to the exotic; from apartment buildings, shopping centers and office towers to a windmill farm, a buffalo sperm bank and the entire town of <LOCATION> Lehigh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Acres </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, population 25,000. No one knows for certain how much it's all worth. The government's own estimate _ $ 300 billion to $ 500 billion _ leaves a wide margin for error. But even at the low end of the range, the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>, when running at full capacity, will in effect be the largest financial institution in the country, twice as large as <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest bank. Already, lawyers, accountants and real estate specialists are swarming, hoping to secure contracts as consultants helping regulators manage and sell the property. Speculators are circling, hoping to buy cheap. A handful of newsletters devoted solely to covering the agency have sprung up. One, the Resolution Trust Reporter, advertised for subscribers at $ 398 a year by asking, `` Who's Going to Cash in When the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Opens Its Doors? HOW ABOUT YOU?'' Consumer watchdogs warn the task is so mammoth and so difficult that scandal is inevitable, scandal dwarfing the troubles now plaguing the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. Whether or not these dire predictions prove true largely depends on <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> and other federal agents managing 260 of the most deeply insolvent S & amp; Ls already under government control in 33 states. They are the antithesis of the high-fliers who drove the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls into the red by making fraudulent loans and spending depositors' funds on lavish parties and corporate jets On the job, they may sit in paneled executive suites and oversee hundreds of employees. But on their own time, they drive rented cars, live out of suitcases and eat in cafeterias for lunch. How well they perform likely will be the critical factor in deciding whether the government successfully completes the S & amp; L bailout without turning to the taxpayers for more money. If the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> sells the property it is inheriting too fast or too cheaply, it could ruin real estate values across the oil-producing regions of the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, further narrowing the taxpayers' chances of recovering part of their contribution to the bailout, estimated at $ 1,000 each. If it keeps the property too long, maintenance and other costs could quickly pile up, offsetting any gain realized by holding out for a higher price. The problem is that much of it is virtually unsellable at any price. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> has banished the word `` problem'' from his vocabulary, substituting `` opportunity.'' `` We have plenty of opportunities. Absolutely!'' he says with the kind of overly cheerful tone used only by a dentist or a man who dismantles banks for a living. Commonwealth's contribution to the real estate mess is about $ 670 million in repossessed property. While <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> has none of the out-of-the-ordinary repossessions that grab headlines, what he does have amply illustrates the `` opportunities'' ahead for the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>. Here's a sampling: _ Two single-family homes in a prosperous northwestern <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> neighborhood Tract mansions, they were built on speculation and repossessed, still unfinished, after the developer could n't make the payments on a $ 794,000 loan. In one, swarms of mosquitoes stream through broken windows and buzz over the glass-strewn floors of what would have been an elegant living room with a stone fireplace and cathedral ceiling. In the other, an empty beer can, candle drippings and graffiti _ `` Led <ORGANIZATION> Zeppelin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION>'' _ show that local youths have made a hangout of what would have been a luxury kitchen encircled by maple-stained cabinets. At most, the homes are now worth $ 100,000 each. _ A shopping strip not far from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s posh Galleria mall Cars cluster in one end of the parking lot around an eight-theater cinema. At the other end, diners stroll from a cafeteria. Between the two stand empty stores, a long expanse of concrete and blank glass. The strip is probably worth less than half of <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 15 million loan _ A vacant lot, just off <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s busy Southwest Freeway A developer borrowed $ 14 million, hoping to build an office tower on the spot, but the deal fell through. All three properties are far from ready for sale. The would-be luxury homes, for instance, have deteriorated so sharply that it could cost more to make them habitable and attractive than it would to buy similar homes in good shape. The shopping center encroaches on an adjoining property, and the government will have to pay lawyers to clear up the title problem before sale. Parcels have been carved from the vacant lot for a gas station and a drive-in bank, leaving an irregularly shaped piece of land scarcely suitable for an office building, even if there were demand for more office space in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, which there is not. Multiply Commonwealth's problems 30-fold to get an idea of the magnitude of the S & amp; L mess in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Multiply Commonwealth 700-fold to get an appreciation of the problem nationally.

 A skeleton of what will be the world's tallest wooden roller coaster already rises above the trees at Six Flags Over <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and planners are concocting other gut-wrenching thrills <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has splurged on a fantasyland of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> diversions and acquired rights to many of the <ORGANIZATION> Muppets </ORGANIZATION>, who will cavort with <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> and Goofy at <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> theme parks. Bidders seeking Sea World may pay more than $ 1 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Shamu </ORGANIZATION>, the killer whale, and other finned celebrities. All this maneuvering reflects one common handicap in the $ 4 billion amusement-park business: Mother Nature still calls most of the shots in a relatively short season that winds down after Labor Day. So, the search for new diversions never ends. This summer, rain and heat kept many fun parks waiting for the crowds, although others reported a late surge to surpass year-ago levels. Especially hard hit were the 200 or so water parks, a fairly new entrant into the amusement game. `` Our June was just horrendous,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeker </PERSON>, spokesman for Wet' N Wild, a water park across the freeway from Six Flags in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>. `` It's almost like summer never came.'' Others had a better time of it. `` We had one weekend in August, which is traditionally one of our biggest months, where we almost did n't even open. But despite all that we're well ahead of last year,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, general manager at <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, which added six new water rides this year. Crystal Beach was not so lucky. The 101-year-old park in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, just across the bridge from <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said it will close down its rides after this season, reflecting increased competition and dwindling crowds. `` This year we just took a nose dive,'' said President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biondolillo </PERSON>. `` A lot of it was due to the rainy spring. Then we started to lose numbers during the good weather.'' Last year, the nation's 600 amusement parks reported more than 249 million visitors and operators surveyed in July said they expected about a 2 percent increase this year, taking the early season weather problems into account. But prices may also be holding back attendance. Admission to 27-year-old Six Flags Over <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is $ 19.95, on the high end of prices among regional parks. `` It's a little steep, especially when all four of us come,'' said <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Corley </PERSON>, who was visiting the park on a recent, 100-degree day. `` We'd think twice'' about coming back if the price were increased, she said. Even next year's scheduled debut of the $ 5 million <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION>, a 4,920-foot long wooden roller coaster, might not be enough to overcome the price, she said. Daughter <PERSON> Elisa </PERSON>, however, had a different view. She likes the park `` because I can have fun.'' Roller coasters are a big draw at the larger parks, and are frequently the main attractions. Worlds of Fun in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, for example, has a much-ballyhooed new coaster this year _ the $ 3 million Timberwolf, and attendance is up 10 percent, park officials said. The coaster recently was rated No. 2 in the nation in a survey by Inside Track, a publication for roller coaster enthusiasts. `` We just had to come to see it,'' said <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, at Worlds of Fun on a recent weekend with family members. She and family said the park was expensive, but they regarded it as a special, once-a-summer outing and were willing to pay. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, at Six Flags-owned Astroworld, The Viper coaster also helped the park overcome early season doldrums brought on by Tropical Storm <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> and Hurricane Chantal. There will be a new ride at <LOCATION> Astroworld </LOCATION> next year as well, but spokeswoman <ORGANIZATION> Debra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> would n't reveal the nature of the attraction, except to say, `` it's going to be a great thrill ride.'' The newest generation of thrills involves motion simulation _ rides that give passengers the feel of hurtling through space, or under water, or flying an airplane. They can cost from $ 120,000 to $ 2 million each, depending on the sophistication. The smaller scale of the motion simulators _ they do n't require towering support structures _ reflect a trend toward downsizing and regionalization. `` We're close to saturation. There's no major metropolitan area in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that does n't have a park within easy driving distance,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Irish </PERSON>, an official with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amusement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attractions </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. As a result, IAAPA trade shows include seminars on miniature golf, go-cart tracks, batting cages and arcades, Irish said Parks also are turning to concerts and other entertainment to draw people during slack times. An IAAPA survey this summer showed more than 30 percent of the projects planned for the largest parks were for entertainment. The parks are hoping to attract more customers like <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> of <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, who visited <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Busch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> along with their grandchildren. `` We like the shows,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> said. `` We really do n't go for the rides too much.'' Regional does not mean less lucrative. <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is selling off its parks _ four Sea Worlds, plus other smaller parks near its <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> headquarters _ and it is estimated the deal could bring the publisher $ 1.5 billion, 23 times what <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> paid for the three Sea Worlds it bought in 1976. Bigger is still better as far as players like <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> are concerned, however. With this year's addition of the new Disney-MGM Studios theme park in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the announced purchase of rights to the Muppet characters this past week, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s pursuit of new attractions has reached Barnum-esque proportions. The Disney-MGM theme park is a $ 400 million playground with diversions that range from do-it-yourself music videos to recreations of 1940s <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>. `` The public response to the new Disney-MGM Studios theme park has been overwhelming, beyond our wildest dreams. It has led to our decision to expand the park, doubling it in size in the next two years,'' spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON> said. The company refuses to disclose attendance figures, but one analyst estimates as many as 150,000 a day pass through the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> gates in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, paying $ 100 for a four-day ticket. Its size and variety make a Disney a `` destination park'' in the lingo of the amusement business. It also profits from nearby attractions that have sprung up in its shadow and feed off its success. The <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> area is home to <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Boardwalk </PERSON> and Baseball, <ORGANIZATION> Cypress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gardens </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Busch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> nearby in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is investing $ 600 million in a Universal Studio park near <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> to compete with Disney.

Currency dealers said market sentiment toward the dollar was bullish following the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government reports showing continued economic strength, which lessens the possibility of lower interest rates. `` The economic numbers ... continued to keep the dollar well supported in spite of technical selling,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, chief currency dealer for <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Arby's Owner Spurns Franchisees' $200 Million Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of franchisees operating more than 500 <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION>'s fast-food restaurants said Wednesday it had offered over $ 200 million for the chain, but the owner says it's not interested in selling. <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is owned by a company controlled by <ORGANIZATION> DWG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Miami-based holding company controlled by industrialist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>. The group of eight franchisees said it wanted to buy the Atlanta-based chain because <ORGANIZATION> DWG </ORGANIZATION>'s continued ownership could threaten the stability of <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, partly because of <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s legal and financial problems. `` We believe strongly that <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> should be owned by its franchisees,'' the group, incorporated as R.B. <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a letter Tuesday to fellow franchisees. `` We are not trying to profit from taking the lead here,'' said the letter, released Wednesday. `` We are trying to protect the Arby's system.'' <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> pleaded no contest in 1987 to federal income tax evasion and was sentenced last year to five years probation on the condition that he pay all his back taxes, penalties and interest, the cost of prosecuting his case and create a $ 3 million fund to benefit the homeless. `` We think it is very unlikely that <PERSON> Arby </PERSON>'s could remain unaffected by all these pressures on Mr. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> DWG </ORGANIZATION>,'' read the franchisees' letter. <PERSON> Arby </PERSON>'s is a wholly owned subsidiary of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Beach-based <ORGANIZATION> Chesapeake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of which <ORGANIZATION> DWG </ORGANIZATION> is a 60 percent owner. <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION>, in a statement released Wednesday, termed the R.B. Partners proposal `` an unsolicited purported offer.'' <PERSON> Chesapeake </PERSON> also said, `` as it had previously informed such franchisees, it presently had no interest in pursuing such a sale.'' <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, who is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is `` committed to the continued growth and expansion of <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION>'s _ a process which, under his management, had resulted in outstanding performance and growth since its acquisition in June 1984,'' <PERSON> Chesapeake </PERSON> stated. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> could not be reached for comment Wednesday. A secretary said President and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was in a meeting. The franchisees said their offer represents three times what <ORGANIZATION> DWG </ORGANIZATION> paid for the chain in 1984 as part of its acquisition of Royal Crown Cola Companies. <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, with about 2,100 restaurants, reported total revenue of $ 153.8 million and an operating profit of $ 20.7 million in 1988. A spokesman for the franchisees, who asked that his name not be used, said Wednesday the group wass confident it could raise the money for the deal and had been assured by a number of institutions that it could get financing. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, a restaurant industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said there have been some cases of successful franchisee buyouts. But he said the main obstacle for the group would be raising the money. `` I do n't believe there would be any legal hurdles. You have to come up with the money,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Split Among Kohlberg Kravis Partners Widens With Lawsuit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, its image one of confidence and strength, stormed to the top of the takeover business by accomplishing billion-dollar leveraged buyouts, including the biggest corporate acquisition of all time. But a lawsuit filed Tuesday by <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, one of the firm's founders, shows the dissension among the ranks of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> partners and adds to the firm's growing problems four months after it completed its record $ 24.53 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In the suit filed in <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> alleged the firm reduced his stake in several companies that were acquired while he was one of <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>'s general partners. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> claims that violated an agreement he made with the firm when he left its management in 1987. The suit names as defendants <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>, its <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> arm and the firm's two other founders, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> alleged the defendants `` determined to secure and transfer ... a portion of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s interests with respect to these companies to themselves or other <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> personnel and-or persons or entities which they chose.'' The firm denied <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s allegations in a statement: `` We are saddened that Mr. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> felt it necessary to sue his partners and <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>. We belive he is wrong, both as to the facts and his interpretation of the agreement between us and we fully expect to prevail in court.'' The suit comes as <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>, a superstar in mergers and acquisitions and the leader among leveraged buyout firms, has run into difficulties with some of its properties. Leveraged buyouts are deals financed mainly with borrowed money that is repaid with the acquired company's cash flow or the sale of its assets. The firm, whose operations long have been a mystery to the public, reportedly has had trouble selling some of its businesses and several others either are foundering or have been disappointing investments. For example, New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Seaman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which went private in a $ 360 million Kohlberg Kravis-engineered LBO two years ago, has said it must renegotiate debt payments, partly because sales growth has not met expectations. <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> formed their partnership in 1976, with each of the three serving as general partners who managed the firm and directed its acquisitions and investments. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> remained a general partner until 1987, when after a falling-out with <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> over the firm's strategy he became a limited partner, sharing in <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>' profits but not in its management. Among the deals undertaken while <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> was a general partner were the 1986 LBOs of consumer products giant <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 6.1 billion and the grocery chain <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 4.2 billion. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> claims that under his 1987 agreement with the firm he was supposed to maintain his previously allocated stakes in companies that <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> acquired while he was still a general partner. In several cases, his interest has been reduced, his suit alleged. The suit involves <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s investment in several <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> properties: _ <ORGANIZATION> Marley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, acquired in a 1981 LBO The company manufactures heat exchange and fluid handling equipment such as boilers and cooling towers. _ <ORGANIZATION> Houdaille </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an industrial products manufacturer, acquired in a 1979 LBO _ <ORGANIZATION> Idex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, formed last year as a holding company for six <LOCATION> Houdaille </LOCATION> subsidiaries _ <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a real estate investment partnership acquired in a 1983 LBO _ <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, acquired in a 1985 LBO, another real estate concern _ <ORGANIZATION> PacTrust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, formed in 1988 as a holding company for <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> For example, the complaint said, <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> decided in June 1988 to recapitalize <PERSON> Marley </PERSON> through the redemption of debt and the purchase of equity interests in <PERSON> Marley </PERSON> of limited partners and other investors. The recapitalization was accomplished through loans from financial institutions and the investment of additional capital by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> partners and other investors, the complaint read. `` In this connection, <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> has informed <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> that his interest in <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>'s investment in the <PERSON> Marley </PERSON> leveraged buyout transaction made in 1981 would be reduced from 32 percent to 17.625 percent, or by almost one-half'' in violation of the 1987 agreement, the complaint said. The complaintdemanded that <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> restore to <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> the interest in the companies as provided for in the 1987 agreement and that the court prohibit the defendants from reducing <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s stake in other companies in violation of the agreement <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>'s other general partners, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonnell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Raether </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelson </PERSON>, were not named as defendants in the suit. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>' limited partners include its investors, among them corporate and state pension funds. These investors _ who also were not named in <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION>'s suit _ help supply the equity for buyouts undertaken by the firm.

 The stock market ended modestly higher Wednesday after a seesaw session in which prices were pushed up and down by program trading. Continuing takeover speculation kept several airline stocks aloft and also benefited share prices of a few other companies. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which bounced between double-digit gains and losses, finished ahead by 1.52 points at 2,728.15. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 11 to 9 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 795 up, 650 down and 537 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 174.35 million shares, little different from the 175.21 million shares traded in the previous session. The market sported moderate gains in the morning before rounds of futures-related program selling rocked stocks in the afternoon and temporarly knocked down share prices. Stock prices bobbed back up, however, amid renewed buying when traders seized oppportunities to profit from the price difference between stock-index futures and actual stocks. A government report that furnished further evidence of economic health failed to have much impact on Wall Street. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personal income rose 0.7 percent in July, the best gain in four months, while consumer spending climbed at its fastest pace since April, up 0.7 percent. With the economy apparently doing better than previously believed, it is much less likely that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will nudge interest rates lower to stimulate growth, analysts say. An upward revision in the gross national product, the broadest measure of the economy's performance, reported Tuesday already had diminished hopes that the central bank would cut interest rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the GNP grew by 2.7 percent from April through July, a significant change from the 1.7 percent growth rate originally reported last month. The <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s most heavily traded share was <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> which was bid higher amid talk that a foreign firm might be interested in acquiring the drug company but <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> said there was no corporate news to account for the heavy trading. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> jumped 2 -RCB- to 41 -LRB- on volume of nearly 4.6 million shares. Takeover speculation continued to steer investors toward airline stocks. AMR, parent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, spurted another 1 \ to 92 -RCB-, adding to Tuesday's gain of 10 <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> reportedly has hired investment banks to help defend itself against unwanted suitors. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> was up -LRB- at 4 -LRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 -RCB- to 84, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, rose 2 -RCB- to 280 and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 -RCB- to 30 \ Among the actively traded blue chips, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> rose -RCB- to 163 -LCB- on word of a 22.2 percent increase in its dividend and a four-for-one stock split.

 Increased demand for home heating oil helped boost prices for energy futures across the board Wednesday. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the September contract for heating oil rose 0.94 cent to close at 53.11 cents a gallon after rising 0.45 cent on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Kellogg Introduces New Cereal It Claims Lowers Cholesterol</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, trying to take advantage of consumers' increasing concerns about health, on Wednesday entered the growing market for foods that purportedly lower cholesterol. <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> at a news conference unveiled a new cereal, Heartwise, which contains oat bran and psyllium. The two grains are high in soluble fiber, which is believed to help the body rid itself of cholesterol. High levels of cholesterol have been shown to increase the risk of heart disease. In introducing its new product, which is expected to reach stores in the fall, <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> is challenging one of its biggest competitors, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, whose Benefit cereal contains the same ingredients. <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> said it would spend $ 40 million in the first year to advertise and promote the new cereal. It will be marketed nationwide. A variety of oat bran products have exploded onto the market since researchers said the grain could help reduce cholesterol levels. But psyllium, a grain grown mainly in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, is a relative newcomer in terms of foods connected with healthy hearts, although it has been used for years in laxatives such as <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s Metamucil. The outer husk of psyllium contains soluble fiber that has been shown to reduce cholesterol, the cereal makers claim. General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>' promotion of Benefit has been challenged by <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, which was ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to refrain from advertising health claims for Metamucil. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> contends psyllium is a drug and should be regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. However, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, instead of declaring psyllium a drug _ and thereby forcing companies to undergo lengthy approval procedures _ is developing a regulation governing health claims on product labels including foods such as cereal. Other cereals made by <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, include Corn Flakes and <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> <PERSON> Krispies </PERSON>. Heartwise will be targeted to consumers age 35 and older, but <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> is planning an advertising campaign that promotes the cereal's benefits for children as well as adults.

 Copper futures prices rebounded Wednesday on news of a strike vote by workers at a <ORGANIZATION> Chilean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> mine, but gains were tempered by reports that labor troubles elsewhere may be easing. On other futures markets, frozen pork belly prices remained strong; cattle and hog prices were mostly lower; wheat futures fell; corn and soybeans were mixed; precious metals declined; and oil futures rallied. In trading at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, copper settled 1 cent to 1.85 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in September at $ 1.29 a pound. The market's strong tone came from reports that workers at Chilean Copper's <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> mine voted to strike on Sept. 1, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, a metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Although labor and management were continuing to talk after Tuesday's vote, copper prices `` closed firm over that strike uncertainty,'' <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said. Still, the market failed to regain the strength it had shown before Tuesday's collapse, when prices settled at least 7 cents lower. The settlement price Wednesday of the September contract was just a penny higher than Tuesday's. Weakness stems from a feeling among traders that settlements may be near in walkouts at <ORGANIZATION> Highland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. `` Most people are feeling that the supply thinness emanating from the special situations is easing,'' <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said. Gold and silver prices declined in mostly featureless trading at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Pressure on both metals came from the strength of the dollar, analysts said. Gold selling also was encouraged by concerns that Tuesday's gains `` were somewhat overdone,'' <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said. Gold prices settled $ 1.50 to $ 1.80 lower, with the contract for delivery in September at $ 361.80 a troy ounce; silver settled .8 cent to 1 cent lower, with the September contract at $ 5.085 a troy ounce. Pork belly prices held strong in trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where cattle and hog futures were mostly lower. The bellies' strength was tied to rumors of possible export sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pork to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, while gains were tempered by a lack of strong market fundamentals. Supplies remain abundant, and there's been no sign that lobbying by pork producers has persuaded the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to include pork in `` in whatever charity package we're going to be sending to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, a livestock consultant in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> DEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We bought the rumor ... we have n't necessarily sold the fact,'' he said. `` The market wants to see something in writing. The ball definitely rests in the adminstration's hands.'' Live cattle settled .20 cent to 1.05 cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at 72.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .37 cent lower to .05 cent higher, with September at 82.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .90 cent lower to .15 cent higher, with October at 40.77 cents a pound; and pork bellies settled .05 cent lower to .65 cent higher, with February at 43.17 cents a pound. Wheat futures dipped while corn and soybeans were mixed in trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Weather concerns kept a lid on prices, as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-day forecast does not include a chance for an early frost and calls instead for nrmal rain and temperatures in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. In addition, more rain is expected to move into the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> by the end of the week, adding further downward pressure to prices, analysts said. Wheat settled 2 -LCB- cents lower to 1 \ cents higher, with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.85 -RCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to -RCB- cent higher, with September at $ 2.31 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 2 -LCB- cents lower, with September at $ 1.32 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans settled 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher, with September at $ 5.79 \ a Oil and gasoline futures climbed at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Crude oil settled 19 cents to 31 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in October up 19 cents at $ 18.83 a barrel; heating oil was .81 cent to 1.03 cents higher, with September at 53.11 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline settled .39 cent to .62 cents a gallon, with September at 55 cents a gallon.

<TEXT>
 Americans' personal incomes rose a brisk 0.7 percent in July while consumer spending climbed at the fastest rate since April, the government said Wednesday in a report providing more good news about the country's economic prospects. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the rise in incomes, fueled by rapid growth in wages and salaries, was the biggest monthly gain since a 1 percent increase in March. The department said that consumer spending also posted a 0.7 percent increase last month, the fastest advance since a 1.2 percent rise in April. The government also made significant revisions to previous months showing that income growth and consumer spending were not as sluggish as previously believed. Private economists said the combination of the strong July increases and the upward revisions in earlier months showed that the current economic expansion, which this month became the second longest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, was picking up steam. Just a month ago, there were widespread fears that just the reverse was occurring, with many analysts predicting, on the basis of weak reports, that the country was in danger of toppling into a recession. `` The economy was not nearly as weak in the spring,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, senior economist at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> brokerage firm of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. `` The image of an economy on the verge of a recession has been changed by these revisions.'' The government on Tuesday significantly revised upward its estimate of total economic growth, putting the increase in the gross national product from April through June at a healthy 2.7 percent annual rate instead of the anemic 1.7 percent rate reported a month ago. Most of the upward revision in GNP growth came from a doubling of the estimate of how much consumers spent during the April-June quarter. Wednesday's report showed that consumer spending was even stronger in July, primarily because of a surge in sales of autos spurred by incentive sales programs aimed at reducing a high inventory of unsold cars. With car sales remaining strong in August, analysts looked for total consumer spending this quarter to surpass the second quarter pace. Since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity, that would be good news for the economy. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> cautioned, however, that the steep discounting to reduce car inventories and buyer concerns about announced price hikes on the 1990 models would very likely translate into lackluster car sales in the final three months of the year and depress consumer spending during that quarter. But <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm, said that she expected other areas, such as sales of clothing and consumer electronics and more travel spending, to take up the slack from an expected drop in car sales. `` We have had some startling revisions in the economic data which have chased away the recession fears and put a whole different look on the strength of the marketplace,'' she said. `` Consumer spending was twice as strong as we earlier thought and that strength seems to be continuing.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is predicting that the economy should grow this year by a healthy 2.9 percent, a rate that private economists are now agreeing is well within reach. The current recovery from the 1981-82 recession, which is already the longest peacetime expansion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, entered its 81st month in August, surpassing the 80-month-long recovery from June 1938 to February 1945, which occurred during World War II. The recovery period actually began in July 1938. The only longer expansion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history is the 106-month-long recovery from February 1961 to December 1969, which occurred during the Vietnam War. The 0.7 percent rise in consumer spending in July followed a much weaker 0.2 percent June increase. The 0.7 percent income rise followed a 0.5 percent June increase. The July report showed that Americans' income after taxes also rose 0.7 percent in July, down slightly from a 0.8 percent after-tax increase in June. With incomes growing at the same rate as spending in July, Americans' savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable income, held steady at 5.7 percent. This matched the June level and was the highest level for savings since a 6.2 percent rate in March. The key component of the income category, wages and salaries, increased by $ 25.4 billion in July, up substantially from a $ 17.6 billion June increase, reflecting widespread gains in all employment categories. On the spending side, the $ 25.4 billion rise in personal consumption spending followed a a $ 6.6 billion June advance. Purchases of durable goods, items such as cars which are expected to last three or more years, jumped $ 7.6 billion, up from a $ 2.6 billion June increase. Overall, personal consumption spending, which includes everything except interest payments on debt, came in at an annual rate of $ 3.48 trillion in July. Personal incomes totaled $ 4.50 trillion at an annual rate in July.

<HEAD>Stock Exchange Amends Proposal for Stock Baskets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, facing a ban on `` stock basket'' trading, announced Wednesday it filed documents to clarify that the investments are securities, not futures contracts. The amended proposal filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was in response to an Aug. 18 decision by the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which halted trading in stock baskets, investments based on the value of broad market indexes. The court said the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> erred last May in approving stock baskets, also known as cash index participation shares, because they do not fall under the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s jurisdiction. The court classified the investments not as stocks but as futures contracts, which fall under the jurisdiction of the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> exchange, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> have traded stock baskets for several months. According to a news release from the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> exchange, the new filing contains proposals that will allow investors who buy or sell stock baskets to sell their shares at any time without any penalty. Previously, investors were charged a penalty unless the sales came at the end of a quarter. Also under the new filing, those investors selling the instruments will receive a price that reflects the value of the underlying stocks at the opening of the market that day, rather than at the previous day's close. `` These changes are in line with the ruling of the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and should remove once and for all the obstacles that stand before us,'' said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON>, the exchange's president. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> exchange first sought <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> approval for stock baskets in March 1988. Baskets are priced to reflect changes in indexes such as the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks. Investors receive quarterly cash payments equal to a proportionate share of any regular cash dividends declared on the stocks in the index.

 Former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> gubernatorial nominee <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, already serving 20 years in prison for bank fraud, was hit Wednesday with a new federal indictment accusing him of receiving illegal bank loans. Indicted along with <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> was his one-time partner, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, currently serving a 10-year bank fraud term, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Harriette </PERSON>, and nine other people. `` We feel the alleged criminal acts represent utter contempt for the criminal justice system,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Genzman </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Named as an unindicted co-conspirator was <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Justice </PERSON>, the imprisoned former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orlando </ORGANIZATION>, which went out of business in 1986. <PERSON> Genzman </PERSON> called the case `` round three of a continuing investigation into the collapse of the bank.'' The 51-count indictment accuses the defendants of involvement in a scheme to obtain $ 3.5 million from `` nominee borrowers'' for Butcher and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> after they had declared bankruptcy in 1984 and 1985. They were also facing a federal fraud investigation in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> relating to the collapse of their banking empire. Justice allegedly accepted $ 75,000 in kickbacks to arrange the loans from <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The loans were nominally for other bank clients, but were actually delivered to Butcher and the <ORGANIZATION> Wilsons </ORGANIZATION>, according to the indictment. The indictment includes counts of making false statements on loan applications, bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and misapplication of funds. <PERSON> Genzman </PERSON> said prosecutors anticipate having all the defendants present for arraignment within 12 days. Butcher could face a maximum 71 years in prison and fines of $ 4.5 million on the charges, while <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> faces 126 years and $ 8 million in fines. Mrs. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Longwood </LOCATION>, could be sentenced to 57 years and a fine of $ 3.5 million.

 <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, the persnickety hotel queen quoted as saying `` only the little people pay taxes,'' was convicted Wednesday of evading $ 1.2 million in income tax by charging personal expenses to her business empire. The federal jury acquitted Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 69, of the most serious charge against her _ conspiring to extort payoffs from vendors. Pictured as a regal perfectionist in ads for <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> luxury hotels, Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was portrayed in court as an abusive, penny-pinching tyrant _ part of a defense strategy of arguing she was the victim of spiteful ex-employees. In opening arguments, her own lawyer labeled her `` a tough bitch.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> shook her head while listening to the litany of guilty verdicts on 33 of 41 counts. Former aides <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON> were convicted of assisting in the tax-evasion scheme. She walked past hundreds of reporters, photographers and bystanders on the courthouse steps, got into a limousine and departed without comment. `` Of course, we'll appeal,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Benfante </PERSON>, lawyer for <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> remains free pending sentencing Nov. 14. Each of the 33 counts carries either three or five years in prison. She also faces fines up to $ 8 million. The jury found Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> evaded federal taxes from 1983 through 1985, most of it by billing $ 3.1 million in expenses from the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, mansion, <PERSON> Dunnellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, to their hotel and real estate business. Among the expenses were more than $ 1 million for a pool enclosure with a marble dance floor; jade figures worth $ 500,000; a $ 130,000 indoor-outdoor sound system similar to one Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> had admired at <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, and thousands of dollars in landscaping. `` Today's verdicts should widely serve as a reminder that no one, regardless of how wealthy or how well-insulated by underlings, under the law is free to flaunt the tax laws,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>. He said it was too early to say what sentence prosecutors would seek. `` We gave a very fair verdict. It was very hard,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>, a member of the jury that deliberated for five days. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, still face prosecution on charges of evading state taxes; no trial date has been set. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 80, heads a $ 5 billion empire that includes 27 hotels _ the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> hotels in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the Cleveland-based <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> chain. He was indicted with his wife in 1988 but was found mentally incompetent to stand trial. In addition to expenses at <LOCATION> Dunnellen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, prosecutors alleged that $ 320,172 in Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s personal purchases, including thousands of dollars in designer clothing, were charged to the Park Lane Hotel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Another item was a $ 45,000 silver clock in the shape of the Helmsley Building, a birthday present to <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> from his wife. His wife's image took a beating at the trial. Already described as a finicky `` queen'' in <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> ads, she was depicted as arrogant and mean-spirited. Her former housekeeper testified that Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> once told her, `` We do n't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.'' Many of the 44 prosecution witnesses during the eight-week trial described how she fired employees at the slightest provocation and disputed bills. Defense attorney <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> sought to discredit the witnesses as disgruntled ex-employees. He also noted the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 57.8 million in taxes during the time covered by the indictment and argued the couple did nothing wrong in billing Dunnellen Hall expenses to their business because they used the estate for business.

<HEAD>Bank Admits Urging Clients to Buy Stock During Merger Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of two Japanese banks planning a major merger admitted Wednesday it had urged its clients to buy stock in the bank in June, but said this had no connection with the merger talks then under way. `` It was intended to increase the number of stable shareholders of the bank's stock,'' said <PERSON> Fukio </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the seventh-largest bank in both <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the world, and <PERSON> Taiyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobe </PERSON>, the eighth-largest, announced Tuesday they will merge April 1 to meet intensifying competition from domestic and foreign banks. The new bank will be the world's second largest. Wednesday's disclosure triggered criticism that <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> was using insider information for its own advantage, but <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> said the stock campaign `` had no connection with the merger talks.'' <PERSON> Taiyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobe </PERSON> has been seen as the main beneficiary of the merger in terms of its stock price. <PERSON> Taiyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobe </PERSON> stock had been steady at the equivalent of about $ 9.80 a share until late June, when it began rising. It closed at $ 11.40 Monday, the day before the merger was announced. Trading in both banks' stock was suspended Tuesday to give investors time to digest details of the merger plan. On Wednesday, buy orders in anticipation of further rises in <LOCATION> Taiyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION>'s stock amounted to 64 million shares, while 450,000 shares were offered for sale. The stock closed Wednesday at $ 13.50 after the maximum one-day gain of $ 2.10 allowed under stock exchange rules. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said they would investigate the merger, but stressed that it would be a `` routine'' probe, not based on any suspicion that insider trading or illegality was involved. <PERSON> Hitoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimakura </PERSON>, head of the Transaction Inspection Division of the world's largest exchange, said his office would look into recent price fluctuations of both banks' stocks. `` The real key is when the actual decision on the merger was made,'' he said. `` As far as insider trading laws are concerned, anything that occurred before the final decision to merge has to be handled separately.'' <PERSON> Kenichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Suematsu </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters at a news conference Tuesday that the merger was formally approved by the boards of directors of both banks on Monday. He said negotiations for the merger began in March. On Wednesday, it was learned from a report compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Shinei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ishino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a brokerage affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, bought 4.7 million <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> shares in June and July, when merger negotiations were in their final stage. Analysts said the huge purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> shares by medium-size <PERSON> Shinei </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishino </PERSON> was caused by the bank's campaign to urge its clients to buy shares. <LOCATION> Taiyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION> officials said they usually recommend that their clients use <PERSON> Shinei </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Junzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamakawa </PERSON>, a vice president of <PERSON> Shinei </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishino </PERSON>, was quoted in the <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keizai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, a major economic newspaper, as saying his company knew nothing about the merger before the announcement, and it was `` entirely our customers' decision'' to buy <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> shares. `` There had been speculation that <PERSON> Taiyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobe </PERSON> was about to announce an important decision because its share prices began soaring while most other bank shares remained sluggish,'' said <PERSON> Keiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishida </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` What's clear now is that the information did leak out and apparently affected its stock price well ahead of the announcement of the merger.

<HEAD>Eastern Plans to Boost Schedule, But May Be Short On Cash</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, nearing the seventh month of its strike, on Wednesday said it will add another 101 daily flights Oct. 1 and is ahead of its rebuilding schedule. The announcement of new flights, most between <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> cities, came a day before Eastern officials were scheduled to make a presentation in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to creditors on their rebuilding plan. While Eastern says it's making good progress on efforts to rebuild without its unions, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> faces $ 400 million in revenue shortfalls and may have to revise its plan for emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. `` We do have a meeting with the creditors and we'll give them an overall status report,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON>. She declined to comment further, but said `` one thing that has n't changed is that the creditors will all be paid. The Journal, quoting unidentified sources, said parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> may underwrite some of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s operations because <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s negotiations with rival <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> on the sale of Latin American routes have stalled The sale had been expected to bring in as much as $ 400 million for Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said recently the carrier may not sell the full $ 1.8 billion in assets envisaged in its original rebuilding plan, and he said the coveted Latin American routes would n't necessarily be sold. While Bakes said Eastern intends to be bigger than first planned, union officials say the effort to rebuild since the strike began March 4 is foundering. `` Obviously this is a setback for -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and the creditors,'' pilots union spokesman <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said. `` To say he's 20 to 25 percent short on his cash projections has to have an unfavorable response from the creditors.'' Referring to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s planned schedule increase, <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said: `` I do n't know where they will get the aircraft.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, whose pilots, <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> and flight attendants unions remain on strike and hope for a new owner, is falling behind on aircraft maintenance. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said the pilots union is exploring bringing more pressure on <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> by threatening to remove $ 800 million in pension fund investments from banks doing business with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. He said details were still being worked out for the effort, which the pilots union hopes will be joined by other unions. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for marketing, said the carrier has sufficient numbers of pilots and planes to boost its schedule again. Eastern earlier announced it will move from 390 daily flights to 601 on Sept. 7, and <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said it will jump to 702 on Oct. 1. There will be several more additions in the month after that, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said, putting Eastern near its target _ 800 daily flights by year's end. `` What this says is we're going to get the airline rebuilt faster than we thought,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. Eastern had nearly 1,100 daily flights and 30,000 employees when it was struck last spring. The company is now back to 12,000 employees and will have 17,000 by year's end, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. Eastern, which is leasing 15 planes and crews from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> sister <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, does n't plan to lease more from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. He said Eastern has 155 planes of its own to fly. The carrier is continuing to offer discount fares such as $ 79 one way between <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. Although Eastern loses money flying passengers at such low prices, he said the priority this year is winning back customers to the rebuilding carrier. `` Ultimately, of course, we've got to prove we can be profitable,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. The new schedule increases, adding new nonstop services from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, move Eastern close to its goal of nearly 300 flights for its <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> hub while moving the rebuilding focus to its `` traditional stronghold'' in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>General Cinema Corp.'s Earnings Up 23 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its earnings rose 26 percent in the three months ended July 31, in part because of a 23 percent rise in attendance at the company's theaters. General <PERSON> Cinema </PERSON> said the boost in earnings also could be attributed to improved performance by <ORGANIZATION> Neiman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marcus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a 59.9 percent-owned subsidiary whose results are consolidated with a one-quarter lag. For the quarter, earnings were $ 25.6 million, or 35 cents a share, on revenue of $ 491.3 million, compared with earnings of $ 21.7 million, or 30 cents a share, on revenue of $ 390 million for the same period in 1988. The year-ago results included after-tax earnings of $ 19.3 million, or 26 cents a share, from operations at the company's soft drink bottling business, which was sold in March 1989. The profit for the first nine months of fiscal 1989, including after-tax income of $ 865.9 million from the discontinued operations, was $ 98 million, or $ 13.06 a share, on revenue of $ 1.46 billion, compared with earnings of $ 963.9 million, or $ 1.16 a share, on revenue of $ 1.24 billion in the 1988 period. `` General Cinema Theatres benefited from an outstandinng crop of summer pictures and reported strong gains in attendance, revenues and operating earnings in the third quarter,'' Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said in a statement. During the quarter, General Cinema added 28 screens and closed 10 older ones, bringing to 1,451 the number of screens at 318 theaters.

 Finnish phone maker <ORGANIZATION> Nokia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it would modify the two mobile telephone components a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administrative law judge said may infringe on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rival's patents. <ORGANIZATION> Nokia </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeber </PERSON> said it can continue selling the cellular phones after posting a bond required by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION> also set a bond for <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Schaumburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, which challenged the Nokia patent. Whichever company loses the patent battle loses its bond. The amount of the bonds is confidential. <PERSON> Loeber </PERSON> said his company wanted to fulfill customers' orders, and made the modifications so imports could continue.

The <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday ordered <ORGANIZATION> Nokia </ORGANIZATION> to stop importing the phones or selling them without posting a bond. <ORGANIZATION> Nokia </ORGANIZATION> said it hopes to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION> to change its mind before the commission's final order is issued next spring. <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> also challenged the patents in federal court in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pickens Says He Won't Run For Governor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Oilman and corporate raider <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said Wednesday he will not run for governor in 1990, but left open his options for 1994. The 61-year-old <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said the crush of his business would not allow him to commit 100 percent of his time to the needs of the state. `` It's not the time,'' he told about 500 people at a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rotary </LOCATION> luncheon, ending weeks of speculation. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said he had prepared two versions of his speech _ one announcing his candidacy and the one he delivered. He and his wife, <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>, reached their decision late Tuesday at their hotel room in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said, and were still discussing it Wednesday morning. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> did not rule out a run in 1994. `` That's an option,'' he said. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> would not endorse any of the Republican candidates who would have been his rivals in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary. His decision not to run, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said, was based on his involvement in his <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> and his <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shareholders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, an oil and gas firm, lost $ 13.4 million in the second quarter and will likely post a loss in the third quarter, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said, refusing to speculate on how large the loss might be. He blamed the losses on declining natural gas prices. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, once feared as a corporate raider and who made a $ 518 million pretax profit in a 1983 attempted takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said it was the first loss for the company in 16 years. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> also said he plans to continue his efforts to open up opportunities for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and may `` significantly'' increase his stake in <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese auto parts supplier. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Boone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> owns 20.2 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>. Although <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> is <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder, he has been denied a seat on the company's board. He said he plans to call for a special <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> shareholders meeting in coming weeks and will continue to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade officials to `` level the playing field'' in trade and investment with the Japanese. `` I think the Japanese are just not playing a fair game,'' he said.
