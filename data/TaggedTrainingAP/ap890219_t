<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rafik </PERSON> <PERSON> Helou </PERSON>, a retired schoolteacher, has n't received his state pension for nearly five months. That's because he's a Christian and lives in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the social security office is in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the Moslem sector He is a victim of a bizarre political crisis in long-suffering <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in which government institutions, including the army, have been split in two by rival Christian and Moslem Cabinets vying for power. The 64-year-old <PERSON> Helou </PERSON>, who has a heart ailment, has to rely on his sons to pay for medicines for himself and his wife, who suffers from diabetes. The power struggle threatens to cement the de facto partition of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Many of the country's estimated 4 million people, hardened by 14 years of civil war, have taken this bureaucratic nightmare in their stride, despite three weeks of bloody fighting between rival Shiite Moslem factions in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But for thousands of people like <PERSON> Helou </PERSON>, it has made the daily struggle for survival even more difficult. State employees are still getting paid. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> still has gold reserves worth an estimated $ 2.5 billion stored at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knox </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. But with foreign currency earnings dwindling, the central bank has turned to internal borrowing from commercial banks to supplement funds officials are able to collect in taxes, customs duties and other levies. But pensioners like <PERSON> Helou </PERSON> have suffered. The social security department's board of directors has not been able to meet to endorse pension payments because <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> officials are afraid to cross the dividing Green Line into west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Helou </PERSON> said in an interview: `` We need 30,000 Lebanese pounds -LRB- $ 60 -RRB- a month for medicines. I relied on my annual pension of 6 million pounds -LRB- $ 12,000 -RRB-, but with two governments I ca n't get it. `` Fortunately my sons are providing me with the medications for the time being. But how long can this go on?'' The crisis began Sept. 22, when President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s 6-year term ended without a successor being named. Minutes before he stepped down, <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named the commander of the Christian army, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, as the head of an interim military Cabinet until a new president was elected. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Syrian-backed Sunni Moslem, and other Moslem leaders refused to acknowledge <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. The government lost its authority long ago and real political power has rested with the heavily armed militias on both sides and their foreign allies, such as <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Yet government departments handling social and economic matters continued to function after a fashion, just enough to maintain a semblance of normality. Now even that slender thread is in jeopardy. <PERSON> Ghassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON>, a Christian municipal employee, said he and his colleagues have not been paid since September. <PERSON> Bitar </PERSON>, 32, who has two children and a wife five months pregnant, said he had to turn his family <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> into a taxi to make ends meet. `` I ca n't leave my family hungry,'' he said. <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> <PERSON> Shehab </PERSON>'s dreams of going to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to study medicine were shatted Ms. <PERSON> Shehab </PERSON>, an 18-year-old Moslem. `` The only alternative was to enroll in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>.'' The university, which once was the most prestigious education center in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, is now a shadow of that since its foreign professors were frightened off by a wave of kidnappings of its American and British lecturers and administrators. But Ms. <PERSON> Shehab </PERSON> noted: `` It's better than nothing.'' An Education Ministry official, <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, said the authorities decided not to issue certificates for students in either west or east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> `` until the government is reunited.'' Even getting in and out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has become a problem for some people. `` Airport officials turned me back when they saw my passport was renewed in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Anis </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON>, a Christian, when he tried to leave through the airport in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` I got my ticket refunded and now I'm going to take the ferry to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> from the Christian port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON>, 24. The Lebanese have learned how to survive under the most arduous conditions during the civil war, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s invasion in 1982 and endless factional feuding. But the cloning of what had passed for their government has exasperated many. `` We're fed up,'' said <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdi </PERSON>, 28, a secretary in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` We want this chaos to end. However, if formal partitioning would lead to security, stability and better living conditions, let it be.'' `` Let's either have formal partition or elect a new president, but let's finish and know where we stand,'' said <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayyoub </PERSON>, 36, who works at an east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> trading company. Every government ministry now has two competing heads. The 40,000-man army, the police and municipal departments are similarly split in two. The only institution that has remained intact is the central bank, which is financing both governments. It is in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hout </PERSON>, economic adviser to bank governor <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>, said the bank's main objective is to provide the basic needs of people of both sides of the sectarian divide. `` We extend advances to both governments to cover wages and salaries for the public sector, to import essential commodities such as fuel and flour and spare parts to maintain such services as electricity and water,'' Hout explained. `` We pay military salaries on both sides, but we wo n't advance money for purchasing armaments.'' The <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has been pressing to impose his disputed authority on the central bank and in December he closed the only crossing point on the Green Line in a move widely seen as retaliation for the bank's providing $ 100,000 to Moslem units. The 10-day closure kept food and fuel from reaching west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from the Christian sector, where the main government warehouses are situated. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> lifted the blockade after Christian business interests complained they were unable to sell their goods in Moslem sectors.

 <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> has had the nation's highest unemployment rate for more than a year. More than 40,000 people have left the Bayou state. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> had a $ 2 billion debt. State and local budget cuts have hurt health care and schools.

 One day last year, state government was within an hour of not making the payroll. One day in the future, economists warn, this city could be knocking on bankruptcy's door. Bond ratings are just one notch above junk bonds. Times are hard in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Charity hospital clinics overflow because the state ca n't afford enough doctors to go around. Windows in City Hall remain cracked and unrepaired. Children go to school in packed classrooms without modern teaching aids such as computers. One town has to turn off street lights to save money. `` We have become a state of mediocrity instead of a state of excellence,'' said Commissioner of Administration <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stine </PERSON>. `` We've become a welfare state instead of a wealthy state.'' Times are hard in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. An estimated 30,000 unskilled oil workers are unemployed; some have been out of work so long their benefits ran out long ago. Many of the state's skilled workers have fled to healthier regions. In all, close to 100,000 jobs have been lost. Even worse, antiquated laws from bygone boom days handcuff public officials' efforts to attract new business and raise the money needed to improve education, health care and the economy. French-Cajun optimism, the let-the-good-times-roll attitude that drank up boom after boom and thirsted through only occasional busts, seems to be fading. People have been packing up and moving out. No hope of another oil boom, they say. No hope. `` We seem to find people with short fuses lately,'' said <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiasson </PERSON>, the manager of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION>' largest unemployment office. `` Do I really see any signs of improvement? No, I really do n't.'' Times are hard in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. The state was forced to borrow $ 1.3 billion to cover its debt, and another $ 1.2 billion to bail out its insolvent unemployment insurance fund. About 10 percent of the state tax collections now go to pay interest on debt. Sales taxes are already highest in the nation _ 9 percent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Businesses fear that they will be taxed to bail the state out. `` It's a spiral _ you ca n't get new business, so you ca n't employ all the people who need jobs,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, director of business and economic research at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION>. `` That does n't mean we will spiral down any further, but there will be no new growth.'' In fact, there are indicators that the economy has bottomed out after two years of depression. There are no signs of improvement, however. The price of oil began its crash in 1984, and two years later a leading state business organization proclaimed that <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s recession had become a depression Unemployment reached 14.5 percent in January 1987. The latest figure is about 10 percent _ twice the national average. Despite its abundance of resources, waterway location and reputation for good food and good times, the state proved to be ill-prepared for the day when the oil `` gravy train'' stopped, economists said. The taxing structure dates back to the days of populist <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, who believed the people were entitled to a free ride at the expense of business. Most homes are exempt from property taxes; many state services are offered at unusually low rates, such as $ 3 a year for an automobile license plate. Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> tried to rearrange the fiscal structure, but his first attempt failed in the Legislature last fall. He says he'll try again, and win, because the future of the state depends on it `` We had a state where big money beat big ideas, and that's a loser. We're trying to reverse it,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. The state has a huge group _ estimated at 30,000 _ of out-of-work oil workers with no employable skills. Most dropped out of school for the lure of big money on oil rigs. Many do n't even have the money now to pack up and move out. `` How are we going to get our present work force into jobs?'' asks <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION>' World Trade Center and chairman of a governor's task force on labor. `` We have to train and develop our workers.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> has seen its sales tax revenue fall so far that the mayor said the only services left to cut were courts and school crossing guards. The city has lost $ 100 million in revenue _ a full one-third of its entire budget _ since oil prices crashed. `` The current budget is in a crisis,'' Mayor <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> said in an interview before opting for an $ 8-per-household `` public safety fee'' and slashing court funding from $ 25 million to $ 15 million, with layoffs in the district attorney's office. But <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> law says the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> ca n't raise property taxes without a general election, and besides, only 15 percent of the homeowners in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> pay property taxes, by law. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> ca n't raise the sales tax, by law. It ca n't create an income tax, by law All <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> says he can do is raise fees, such as slapping a surcharge on water bills for `` public safety.'' The city of <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, in the northern part of the state, balanced its budget by laying off 115 <ORGANIZATION> Sanitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> workers, abolishing back door garbage pickups and raising water and sewer rates 25 percent. <LOCATION> Houma </LOCATION>, an oil town near the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, found times were so hard that 3,000 street lights had to be turned off to save money. `` Business has never been as bad,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Catlett </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Houma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pawn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION>. `` I ca n't see any improvement, and I'm usually the first to tell.'' New Orleans school Supt. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has had to cope with all the problems of a large, urban school system while his budget has been slashed. The state cut back on its funding, so did the federal government, and the city. He's laid off 300 employees. His teacher-pupil ratio has climbed to 29-to-1 in elementary schools. His counselor-to-pupil ratio is 450-to-1. Voters approved a bond package to help the schools, but it's not enough. This year, the schools are operating with $ 30 million in `` bridge funding'' from the state. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is worried he'll lose that money next year. That could mean more layoffs, a shorter school year, and a budget so poor `` I really could n't operate the school district.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, like Mayor <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON>, Gov. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, economists and business leaders, says the key to the future will be reshaping the tax structure to promote new business and remove the handcuffs from local governments. Despite the element of futility, they see good times ahead. `` I am optimistic, and I guess that's how we survive,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The governor added, `` We are going to turn this state around.''

<TEXT>
 Inside the dingy walls of <LOCATION> Indira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gandhi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, doctors and nurses wage their own battle to save children from the savagery of the war _ booby-trapped toys, rockets, bombs and bullets. Mriya, a 4-year-old from <LOCATION> Charikar </LOCATION>, 45 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, was badly injured three weeks ago by artillery fire as Soviet and Afghan troops attacked Moslem guerrillas trying to topple the government. She suffered broken bones, but she was lucky. Ten of the 12 people living in her house were killed. Six children injured in a guerrilla rocket attack in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> were brought to the 300-bed hospital last week. Doctors were able to save three of them. When the parents of one of survivor were told their 12-year-old son's right leg would have to be amputated, the father sobbed and cried: `` Oh, let him die. Let him die. He's no good anymore.'' Even before civil war broke out in 1978, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> had the world's highest child mortality rate, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> statisics. At least 340 of every 1,000 children will not reach their fifth birthday, and doctors and nurses working in a country where medical care is far below accepted standards are struggling to keep the number from rising. `` We want to get away from politics as much as possible here,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Salam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jalali </PERSON>, head of the 102-member hospital staff. `` There may be sons of mujahedeen -LRB- guerrilla -RRB- commanders here. We do n't ask. They are children. They are not directly involved in the war.'' Some children have been injured by toys rigged with explosives and left on streets. It is unclear whether the booby traps are the work of Afghan government forces or the guerrillas. More than 1 million people have died in the war, which has severely strained the hospital, built in 1972 by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and named after its late prime minister. It is always crowded and cockroaches climb the walls. `` Sometimes we put two or three patients in one bed. Sometimes we put them in a corridor or on the floor. But we never refuse a patient, and it's all completely free,'' <PERSON> Jalali </PERSON> said. The cost of medicine and food has soared and consumed the hospital's budget. All medicine is imported and getting it to the hospital is difficult because of fuel shortages and guerrilla attacks on government convoys. A lack of supplies often forces doctors to reuse bandages. The war also has made it harder for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s poor to afford nutritional food and has diverted attention from child health care. `` They do n't bother about these problems,'' <PERSON> Jalali </PERSON> said. `` They just want to stay alive, and when they finally do bring them to the hospital it's often too late.'' `` Malnutrition is our main problem. This has been going on for years, but now it's worse,'' he said. Emaciated children, their resistance weakened by lack of food, suffer tuberculosis, meningitis and other diseases. In the final weeks of the Soviet troop withdrawal, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> suffered severe food shortages. Vegetable and fruit stands at city markets now are full, but prices are far beyond the reach of the poor. The situation is worse for children in other parts of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khagal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>, who livesin the <LOCATION> Laghman </LOCATION> province east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, weighs about 15 pounds, the normal weight for a 7-month-old baby. He is 4 years old. <PERSON> Mayabim </PERSON>, a 5-year-old from central <LOCATION> Hazarajat </LOCATION> weighs only 20 pounds, and suffers from tuberculosis, meningitis and brain damage. `` We were too far away. It took us too long to get here,'' said his sobbing mother, <PERSON> Gulandam </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> _ a Moslem organization similar to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> _ and other charities also care for children but say more help is needed. `` Peace is a prerequisite, and peace for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is not yet on the horizon,'' said <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilley </PERSON>.

 Quotations are the salt and pepper of political speeches, and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have long had their own wit and wisdom enlivened by them. As often as not those quotes have come from the quote files maintained for the last 50 years by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Now, 2,100 of the best have been gleaned from those files and put between the covers of a book, `` Respectfully Quoted,'' in time for the celebration this year of the 200th anniversary of the convening of the 1st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1789. While the range is wide, many of the quotations requested by congressmen concern <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> itself, even quotes which are less than flattering to the institution and its members. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is so strange,'' a Russian visitor observed. `` A man gets up to speak and says nothing. Nobody listens. And then everybody disagrees.'' American humorist <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>: `` With <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ every time they make a joke, it's a law. And every time they make a law it's a joke.'' Or the opening line from the actor playing <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in the musical, `` 1776'' _ `` I have come to the conclusion that one useless man is called a disgrace, that two are called a law firm and that three or more become a congress.'' Or this, from <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>: `` It could probably be shown by facts or figures that there is no distinctly <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> criminal class except <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Someone once asked the Rev. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, then chaplain of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, `` Do you pray for the senators, Dr. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>?'' The quoted reply: `` No, I look at the senators and pray for the country.'' From Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Miss., at a 1923 farewell dinner: `` I sometimes think I'd rather be a dog and bay at the moon then stay in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> another six years and listen to it. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, like other politicians, obtain office through elections and the new volume has quotations to offer on that subject: Such as: `` An election is coming. Universal peace is declared, and the foxes have a sincere interest in prolonging the lives of the poultry'' _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON>, the English author, in 1866. There is much advice on how to govern: _ `` The great art of governing consists of not letting men grow old in their jobs'' _ <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonaparte </PERSON>. _ `` A government which robs <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> to pay <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> can always depend on the support of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>.'' _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. _ `` There is no Democratic or Republican way of cleaning the streets'' _ <LOCATION> Fiorello </LOCATION> <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardia </LOCATION>. Politicians of course make promises. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> is alleged to have once said: `` We must not promise what we ought not, lest we be called on to perform what we can not.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says the accuracy of the quote can not be verified. It does vouch, however, for the authenticity of <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>'s declaration that: `` Promises and pie-crusts ... are made to be broken.

 Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s peacemaker for a generation, is virtually assured an unprecedented sixth term in elections this month, but his dream of a truly united city seems out of reach. <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> is expected to lose control of the city council to religious and right-wing parties in the Feb. 28 vote, a development that could heat up the religious and Arab-Jewish conflicts dividing the city of 500,000. The 77-year-old <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> knows what he's up against. `` You have an increase of the extreme edges on all sides,'' said <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON>, citing rises in religious, nationalist and secular activism. `` To keep a middle line is very complicated.'' During a recent campaign stop in the outdoor <ORGANIZATION> Mahane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yehuda </ORGANIZATION> market, a rowdy stronghold of right-wing sentiments, he looked out of place in his blue wool suit and brown fur hat. But he was thronged by the vendors, some applauding and shouting `` Teddy, <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON>!'' His popularity is expected to help the Vienna-born mayor match his 1983 results, when he won 65 percent in the direct vote. His One <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> slate took 17 of 31 city council seats. But this year, <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> could lose council control because of the growing strength of the religious parties and the announced election boycott by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> voters, traditionally <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> supporters. Working with a hostile council would weaken <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON>, who has been credited for keeping much of the bloodshed of the 14-month-old Palestinian uprising out of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> by trying to cool tempers and arguing with aggressive policemen. The religious-secular conflict heated up in the summer of 1987 when Orthodox Jewish men in black coats and hats hurled stones at Friday night moviegoers to protest the screening of films on the Jewish Sabbath. The `` movie wars'' are part of an intensified ultra-Orthodox campaign for more laws guarding the sanctity of the Sabbath and greater budget allocations for religious education and housing. `` We are fighting for the soul of the nation,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON>, leader of the ultra-Orthodox <ORGANIZATION> Shas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in a campaign video. Shas and others are not targeting the sure <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> vote _ about 30 percent of the city's 350,000 Jewish residents. They are after less observant Jews seeking reassurance in troubled times, the same voters who were mainly responsible for the religious parties' gains in the November general election. Secular activists warn that the `` black hats'' will turn <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> into an Iran-style theocracy. The city turns into a virtual ghost town on the <LOCATION> Sabbath </LOCATION>, forcing many residents to drive 40 miles to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> for weekend entertainment. `` The Orthodox are saying ` We took on the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- parliament -RRB- and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is next,''' said <PERSON> Anat </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a council candidate for the secular <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. Across town, in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, there are no indications that an election campaign is being waged. Many Palestinians have stayed away from elections to show they do n't accept the annexation of east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. In 1983, 12,000 of the city's 150,000 Arab residents cast votes, but this year all the Arab residents are expected to boycott the elections. Leaders of the uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories have urged activists to `` strike against all who participate in such an election.'' `` Participation in the elections would imply that we accept unilateral annexation,'' said <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> supporter and editor of the Arabic-language Al Fajr newspaper. <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON> acknowledged, however, that <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> had a better image among Palestinians than his opponents. <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> said tolerance was the central message of his campaign. `` This is a very complicated city. We have Jews from 103 different backgrounds, 40 different Christian denominations, and we have Arabs who are n't all united either,'' <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> said. `` If we wo n't be tolerant toward one another, there will be no life in the city.''

<HEAD>New Interpretation Could Let Official Keep Stock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government agency regulating the savings and loan industry has relaxed its reading of an internal rule in a way that apparently will allow one of its top officials to keep his stock in a family business. The rule, which had prompted <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> to promise to get rid of the stock, has been interpreted too literally, according to <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quillian </PERSON>, deputy general counsel for the board. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> promised when he joined the board in 1987 that he would divest himself of his 29 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Pope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. That promise was made to the Office of Government Ethics and incorporated into <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s sworn testimony during his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearing Once he made that promise, federal ethics laws required <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> to carry through and rid himself of the stock within 90 days of his confirmation. But he says he did not want to dispose of his holding in the company and, after making his promise, received verbal advice that he could keep the stock. <PERSON> Quillian </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> last week saying that the interpretation of the agency's rules he gave <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> in 1987 was wrong. The original interpretation resulted from defining the word `` employee'' in the board regulation so broadly that it would, in effect, consider a company in which an employee owned a substantial interest an `` employee'' of the board as well as the actual employee himself. That way, rules on such things as conflicts of interest and ethics would apply not only to board employees, but to the actions of companies in which they held a substantial interest. `` While that is certainly the literal interpretation of that provision, such an interpretation would of course be unenforceable,'' <PERSON> Quillian </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> last week. `` Accordingly, we have decided after further research and reflection that the definition can not and should not be interpreted literally.'' Pope Scientific, based in <LOCATION> Menomonee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, manufactures laboratory glassware and instruments. While it has done work for the government from time to time, it would have little or no occasion to bring it into contact with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. In letters to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> complained that under the literal interpretation of the board's rules, `` I would have had to report on federal financial disclosure forms the entire interest of <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> as if I were its sole owner. Until <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> became a member of the bank board in 1987, he was Pope Scientific's chairman. His wife, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, owns 51 percent of the company and is its president. His son, <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON>, is vice president. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> also said that `` there is no such requirement'' that would compel him to sell his interest in the company. However, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, chief counsel for the Office of Government Ethics, said that once <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> made a promise to divest, he either had to do it or explain why not. `` He has a requirement to act on the terms of his ethics agreement unless he provides an explanation for the change in conditions,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. Using the range categories on financial disclosure forms, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> listed his 29 percent stake in the company as being worth between $ 100,000 and $ 250,000. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> did sell other financial holdings when he joined the bank board. He had held stock in <ORGANIZATION> MGIC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and was vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He sold that stock, resigned the post and promised not to take part in matters affecting that company or the mortgage insurance industry. The bank board, which regulates and audits the nation's savings and loans, has been overrun with work as that industry has sunk into such deep financial trouble that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed a massive federal bailout. Some of the board's paperwork has fallen through the cracks. `` For the last any number of months we've been like one-armed paper hangers,'' <PERSON> Quillian </PERSON> said. `` But in the present circumstances it seemed like it was well to drop everything and get this out on paper, which we've now done,'' <PERSON> Quillian </PERSON> said. Asked what the `` present circumstances'' were, he replied: `` You guys writing about it.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Umarou </PERSON> emerged from a helmet-shaped granary of golden straw, her arms laden with millet stalks, and headed home past a dozen other new granaries built for the best harvest in 20 years. This country on the southern edge of the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>, which has been forced to ask the world for food repeatedly for more than a decade, is feeding itself this year. Rains last spring and summer were plentiful and farmers say conditions for planting had n't been better in 30 years. The government reported a grain surplus of more than 200,000 tons after the harvest last fall, enough to carry the country through this spring's planting. Pastures are green and herds are increasing. Bellies are full and children are smiling. Things are as good as they have been in a long, long time. `` My children eat now when they want. My husband is strong. I am less afraid and still there is more grain,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Umarou </PERSON> said, speaking in the tribal language of Djerma through a translator. But in a region where problems are profound, a year as good as 1988 shows just how bad things really are. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, an official with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Niamey </LOCATION>, about 20 miles away, said bumper harvests in this <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nation are so rare some villagers did n't know what to do. `` In one village, they have gone a whole generation without anything left over so they did n't know how to construct granaries. The government sent a team to teach them,'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. From <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast across to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> in the east the situation was much the same, with the countries on the vast arid border south of the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> reporting better than average rainfall in 1988. Record harvests were reported in <LOCATION> Burkina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Faso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>. `` If it rained for 20 years you would have healthy people in <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. `` But you have to turn that abundance into productive, sustainable, non-agricultural activities. If not, when the rain stops in the 21st year you will need emergency food.'' Many experts in development agencies say wealthy people here tend to invest their money abroad. Exceptions are those who build houses in the capital to rent and others who buy agricultural products and horde them for resale. `` There is a surplus of millet, prices have fallen and there is no government price support,'' said <PERSON> Olav </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakken </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> of CARE. `` The rich merchants buy it, hold it until there is n't any food and then resell it, often to aid agencies at inflated prices, who distribute it as emergency food. They ca n't go wrong and the poor farmer who needs the cash has no choice but to sell.'' Even one obvious benefit of the good harvest, well-fed youngsters, has a sobering side. `` Of course the children born this year will get a better start,'' said <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>. `` But then there will be more babies, more marriages by people who have been putting off getting married for years. Even the government has informally asked people to not use their extra income to buy too many wives. But this is precisely what is happening.'' In the eastern province of <LOCATION> Zinder </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Tulane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> has been weighing babies in a project for CARE. He has found some surprising results: the number of children suffering acute malnutrition has decreased since the famine of 1984, but the number of children with chronic malnutrition is on the rise. Those who were starved as infants have not yet recovered, he said, and malnutrition is tied to more than simply how much a child eats. `` Millet is good and children this year are getting lots of millet. But they are not getting the variety of protein and vitamins babies need for muscle growth. A baby needs quality, not just quantity,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> explained. Still, any respite in the harsh environment ca n't help but boost morale. `` In the first year or two of drought a person can retain some hope,'' said <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, director of the agricultural weather station set up to monitor conditions after the disastrous 1072-73 drought. `` But after years and years, you just give up. With rain, people feel happier, they're willing to cooperate with government programs and even push for more help with development.''

<HEAD>U.S. Prematurely Terminates Government Management Project</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A highly unusual project in which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic experts tried to help <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> straighten out its chaotic governmental finances has ended abruptly, reportedly scuttled by Liberian President <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>. One frustrated American participant said <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> could not be persuaded to abandon his practice of maintaining an extracurricular budget outside the government's control. The premature termination roughly halfway into the two-year project, coming as it does on the heels of a congressional freeze on aid to <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, may be prompting <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> into action. <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, a former army sergeant who took power in a bloody 1980 coup, is considering a trip to the funeral of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> in hopes of meeting President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Liberian </LOCATION> officials and dissidents say. Although the evolving situation remains in flux, analysts are concerned it could prompt a renewal of threats against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests in the coastal African nation, which is supported largely by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid and investment. The project, which stemmed from <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>'s efforts to boost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support and introduce some order into his government finances, was billed as a $ 15.5 million program when it was signed in 1987. The unusual arrangement, which gave American experts the right to cosign Liberian government checks, was made possible by the historic links between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, a country of 2.3 million residents that was founded in the 19th century by freed slaves. All but one or two of the 17 experts, who have stayed behind to complete computerization programs, are now back in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, Vice President of <ORGANIZATION> Lewis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted the project under contract to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The team was frustrated by lack of support from <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> and by his practice of maintaining a budget outside the government's control, <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> said. A statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said the project achieved progress in getting the government to meet its payroll on time, pay pensions and increase tax receipts. `` Unfortunately, progress was not uniform and some serious problems could not be resolved,'' said the statement. Dissidents and congressional staffers said the team discovered that <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> manages part of the government budget like a discretionary slush fund which was outside the purview of the American experts. A spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Liberian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarl </PERSON>, declined to discuss the project, saying only that it had been completed in a satisfactory manner. Specifically, revenues from the government-owned corporations for forestry and petroleum products _ which account for about 40 percent of the state's income _ were handled directly by <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, an exiled <LOCATION> Liberian </LOCATION> political scientist who heads a dissident organization in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> uses these funds to cater to various whims, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said. For example, when <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>'s soccer team beat <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> last year, <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> declared a national holiday and gave the team $ 1 million. But <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> also used the money for public works projects and to pay back official bank loans. <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> has not protested the recent setbacks in relations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Krecke </PERSON> in a telephone conversation from <LOCATION> Monrovia </LOCATION>. But there is concern that <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> may renew past threats against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> communications facilities and military access rights, officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> experts say he has not acted on these threats in the past because too much of his economy depends on American investments. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been the bulwark of <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>'s economy, pouring $ 434 million in financial aid between 1980 and 1986. There also is some $ 400 million worth of private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, much of it in rubber plantations, iron ore mining and forestry. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains a relay station for <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, officials said. There is also a diplomatic communications facility that handles traffic from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> posts in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is involved in running a tracking station for navigation in the region, officials said. Economic aid to <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, which suffers from a crushing debt burden and foreign exchange shortages, was frozen last year after the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> failed to certify that the country had made progress in rectifying human rights abuses, officials said. As a result, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has so far withheld $ 22 million in aid _ about one-third of the funds allotted to <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, according to AID. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s recently released report on human rights says <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>'s record `` was set back in 1988 by several adverse developments,'' including the unexplained deaths of several men while in detention for unsubstantiated charges of plotting a coup.

<HEAD>Six Months After Strikes, Miners Fear Solidarity Might Not be Enough</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Six months ago, angry miners shut down the deep coal mines ringing this desolate city in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to demand the government recognize Solidarity. Now the miners seem to be within reach of their goal, but some fear that even a free trade union will not be enough to fight the poverty that caused them to strike in the first place. Since Feb. 6, government and Solidarity representatives have been talking in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, and they are near agreement on terms to reinstate the union after a seven-year ban. Their eyes shadowed with coal dust, the miners talked quietly last week while waiting to greet Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Manifest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lipcowy </LOCATION> mine, where the first strike began. `` Things have n't changed much. We do n't know what it is we're going to get and we do n't know when,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilat </PERSON>, whose job during the strikes was to sound the alarm when police prepared to rush the mine gates <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> came to Manifest Lipcowy to tell Solidarity activists how the talks in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, 220 miles to the north, were proceeding. Local union leader <PERSON> Alojzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietrzyk </PERSON> calls <PERSON> Jastrzebie </PERSON>, a city of just more than 100,000 people, a `` concrete reservation.'' But in the 1960s and'70s, thousands of workers flocked to <PERSON> Jastrzebie </PERSON>, attracted by the promise of good wages and housing in the new apartments the government had slapped together. In its haste to attract workers to mine the nearby rich lodes of black coal, the government left a few things out. Stores are few and poorly stocked. A couple of restaurants and a few movie theaters and discos can be found hidden among the high rises. Now there is a housing shortage and young miners are forced to spend years living in workers' hotels. `` There is nothing to do and nothing to buy,'' said one miner, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutkowski </PERSON>. `` Things are really hard and I do n't think they'll get better. What bothers miners most is a pay system that forces them to work for bonus money on Saturday and Sunday to earn enough to survive, and primitive working conditions that claimed the lives of 85 miners in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last year. It was disgust over management's failure to honor raises negotiated by the official trade union alliance OPZZ that led to the strike at <ORGANIZATION> Manifest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lipcowy </ORGANIZATION> when miners opened their pay envelopes Aug. 15. The strike spread rapidly to other mines in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and the No. 1 demand became the reinstatement of Solidarity, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first free trade union. It had operated legally for 16 months before being outlawed in 1982. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> agreed to suspend the strikes when authorities proposed talks with the opposition and promised to include Solidarity's future on the agenda But the coal miners were skeptical and it took a visit from <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and hours of hard bargaining to persuade them to stop the strike on its 19th day. The miners see Solidarity as the only means by which they can present grievances in negotiations with management. During his visit Tuesday, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told miners: `` I know you are tired with your work, these conditions, with what is happening on the market, with your families, but I would like to talk to you without censorship so I could understand my mistakes and your strivings.'' The workers asked <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> how he could trust the government. He said he lacked specific answers but urged the miners to help rebuild <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` Everything shows now there is a civilized solution ... We have to have a bit of responsibility,'' he said. `` I appeal to you to build organizations. ... There are so many problems. You have to approach them in an organized way,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. Solidarity regional leader <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalczyk </PERSON> needed no pep talk. While some workers hounded <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> for autographs after the meeting, <PERSON> Kowalczyk </PERSON> scurried around and pressed miners to take freshly printed Solidarity sign-up sheets. `` Management says they still do n't want to talk to us, but they are n't stopping us from organizing and there is a lot to do,'' said <PERSON> Kowalczyk </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is struggling through a budget crunch, hoping to delay the threatened closing of weather offices until they can be replaced by new automated equipment in a few years. Over the long term the agency seems likely to close a hundred or more of its nearly 250 local offices, replacing them with an extensive network of automated information-gathering equipment. But even as that planning is underway, officials are trying to cope with a money shortage in the current fiscal year that could grow even more severe in 1990. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration annually has proposed closing large numbers of weather offices to save money. And although <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has thwarted that in the past, a hiring freeze has had to be imposed this year and some local offices may be in jeopardy because of the lack of money. The current fiscal year is expected to end with the weather service short between $ 10 million and $ 28 million, although <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said things are looking brighter than they were a few weeks ago. <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> spending proposed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for 1990, meanwhile, was set at $ 1.14 billion, down from $ 1.19 billion in the current fiscal year. And while the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was marked for somewhat of an increase within that budget, that has to include money to cover the purchase of new radar and observation equipment and a supercomputer. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposal called for staff cuts, consolidations of offices and for private weather services to take on more specialized forecasting tasks, while the government concentrates on general forecasts and warnings. Full details of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposal were not released by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, but word on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> was that the plan could have required closing as many as 62 local weather offices this year and 77 more in 1990. Congressional sources said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration may be reconsidering whether such drastic cuts are necessary. <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said they are discussing with <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> ways to keep offices open, but details were not being made public. However, the two pages slated to include the list of station closings were left blank when the 1990 <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> budget was sent to the printers, according to <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee that oversees <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>. Some closings may occur in cases of obvious duplication where stations are relatively close together, he said. Once new automated equipment is in place, more extensive office closings will be easier to defend because weather forecasting would not be hindered, <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> officials say. But that would occur over several years, perhaps as long as a decade. <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> officials say the automated observing equipment is planned for installation in three times as many locations as there are currently weather offices. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, however, has said that the closings eventually could affect a hundred offices or more. And <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> officials privately admit that after the reorganization is complete they expect to have fewer than 150 local offices, compared to the current 250 or so. Reductions in staff would occur by attrition, they say. The long-term, the <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> modernization plan was originally scheduled to be sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week but that has been delayed. A complicating factor is the fact that many top officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> leave office March 1, and others remain on the job but unsure whether they will be transferred or replaced. The Office of Management and Budget says the <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> budget is part of a group of domestic programs frozen at 1989 levels, included in a $ 136 billion `` pot'' of programs subject to negotiation with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

 CBS is blitzing the other networks' coverage of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip to the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> this week, taking most of its news broadcasts to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> at a cost of at least $ 2 million. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> also will be on location for <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will attend the funeral Thursday in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, then he goes to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. At a news conference last week, `` Evening News'' anchor <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> called the coverage `` unprecedented'' by broadcast news, but warranted by <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death as a symbol of `` the end of the postwar era.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> will anchor `` ABC World News Tonight'' from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> all week. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> will anchor `` NBC Nightly News'' from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Thursday and Friday, then from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Saturday and Sunday. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> will anchor live coverage of the funeral from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The networks have all focused on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s culture and economy in reports leading up to the funeral and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip. CBS, which began on-location coverage Sunday with `` CBS Sunday Morning,'' also is taking the `` CBS Evening News,'' `` CBS This Morning,'' `` 48 Hours'' and `` Face the Nation'' to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The coverage concludes next Sunday with `` Face the Nation'' from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The broadcasts will focus on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s relationship to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in terms of economy, lifestyles and military interdependence. CBS' `` 48 Hours'' will have live coverage of the beginning of the funeral Thursday night, when it will be Friday morning in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. CBS News figures it will have 18 hours of special coverage from the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> at a cost of at least $ 2 million, Rather said. `` We thought long and hard about whether should make this kind of commitment to this story at this time,'' he said. `` This is a gamble for us.'' `` But we think in this particular case we can make it work,'' he said.

 They met in the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> on the Republican side of the aisle, the raven-haired representative from <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> seated directly behind the handsome young floor leader from <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>. When she decided to run for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1978, they got together to map out campaign strategy. Over the years their shared interest in politics blossomed into something more. The decade-long courtship between Rep. <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> will culminate this week in an exchange of marriage vows. `` What holds our relationship together is the fact that we love politics,'' said <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>, now in her sixth term in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` For some, that becomes a dividing factor, but in our case that obviously has n't been the situation.'' `` We both have our own careers and they happen to be in the same field,'' said <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON>, a former two-term congressman who was elected governor in 1986. `` We understand the pressures that are on each other.'' The wedding Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> is of <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> descent _ will begin the second marriage for both. The announcement of their pending nuptials three weeks ago evoked surprise that two of a small state's most prominent political figures could have kept a romance of nearly a decade relatively private. `` A hush-hush affair,'' marveled one of <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>'s constituents, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Boisvert </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION>. `` Nobody seemed to know anything about it. But it's nice.'' <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>, who turns 42 on Tuesday, was widowed in 1973 when her husband was killed in an accident while driving home from the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, where he served in the House. She entered politics by running successfully for his seat. The 40-year-old <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON>'s first marriage ended in divorce in 1978. He has an 18-year-old son, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>. <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> realize they will spend most of their time 600 miles apart, one in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the other in the state capital of <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, getting together on weekends and during congressional recesses. They will try, as much as possible, to coordinate their schedules and expect to divide their time between the <ORGANIZATION> Blaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ the executive mansion in <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> _ and <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, 35 miles away. `` The most important factor in any relationship is communication,'' <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> said, describing their daily telephone conversations. `` Talking about what happens during the day to each of us makes it feel we're not that far away.'' <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> and <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> said they believe their careers will insulate them from the problems of other politicians whose marriages broke because they were unable to balance their political responsibilities with the demands of family life. In other marriages, <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> noted, `` only one of them is involved in politics, and the other one gets left behind a lot.'' They acknowledge their differences in personality. He is deliberate, an outgrowth of his legal training; she tends to rely more heavily on instinct. The romance blossomed while the two were in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, serving as <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s delegation in the House. Their private joke on their trips home: `` Your district or mine?'' The relationship was never splashed across the front pages, but neither was it concealed. Whenever the subject was broached by reporters, <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> and <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> acknowledged that they dated each other but offered no elaboration. The reaction to their engagement has been positive, they said, with congratulatory calls from President and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Referring to his and <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>'s shared ethnic background, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> that `` mixed marriages work _ especially if one of the partners is Greek. <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> is a Protestant. Their honeymoon will be a weekend in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with dinner and the theater. Both must be in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the following week, <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> to tend to her congressional duties and <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> for a meeting of the nation's governors. While the wedding itself will be limited to family members and close friends, the couple mailed invitations to 7,500 friends and political supporters for a reception the following week at the <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>.

 Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a liberal Democrat and black veteran of the civil rights wars of the 60s, is willing to put his enthusiasm for white conservative Republican <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> in the language understood on the poor street corners of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` He can walk the walk, and he can talk the talk,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said recently of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's housing chief. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' deliberate use of an expression more familiar in the black neighborhoods he represents than in the white suburbs that produced <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was meant to communicate. The meaning was clear: Despite their differences, this man <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is OK. He's all right. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>'s comment last week came after two days of tramping with the former pro quarterback through those <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> neighborhoods in <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s first look at inner city problems since becoming secretary of the Housing and Urban Development. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> went one-on-one with <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s black leaders and veterans of the civil rights struggle of the 1950s and 60s _ such as <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and the family of the late <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> _ offering them his own brand of bubbly, irrepressible excitement about the power of unleashed free enterprise. All welcomed him warmly and seemed to confirm what <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s supporters were arguing during his unsuccessfully presidential campaign last year: <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, architect of the 1981 income tax cuts now so identified with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, has a strong reservoir of good will among blacks `` We have serious problems, as you well understand,'' <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, widow of the late civil rights leader, told him. `` You lift our spirits because you have hope they can be solved.'' Taking control of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> heads a department important for urban blacks because it administers the federal programs for housing and redevelopment of blighted cities _ programs that are dramatically reduced after eight years under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> hopes to make <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> the catalyst for new incentives to attract private development into those same neighborhoods. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s support among blacks could be of benefit to the new administration and to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and new Republican National Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> set out to win black support away from Democrats. And it could benefit <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> in the future. `` There's no question that a candidate who can attract the support of rock-ribbed conservatives and urban blacks would make one hell of a candidate,'' said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s political consultant, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> himself tried to sidestep the political questions. `` That is tangential,'' he said. `` The best politics is to do a good job.'' Many cite <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s background in professional football, where was quarterback, team captain and president of the players' union, as a source of black support. He has maintained friendships with prominent blacks, and has hired <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>, a black conservative and former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House aide, as his chief of staff. `` He knows his safety and indeed his life depended on the ability of black linemen,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. But it is also due to <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s enthusiastic talk about doing something to solve the housing problem facing the poor. More than just his proposals for enterprise zones and other inducements to attract private business into the inner cities, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has raised expectations just by talking about making progress on housing. That trait is even more noticeable coming on the heels of a relative eight-year silence by his predecessor, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. `` He has the kind of creative mind that I admire,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a Democrat and former congressman, said. `` Right now, things are so bad that we've got to work together and solve problems.

He plans a second tour next week, of homelessness in Northeastern cities. But <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s high visibility and bold talk carries risk. He is given to sweeping statements and boundless expectations, which Democrats are no doubt recording for replay in four years if he falls short. `` I want to eliminate poverty,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told one group in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` There's not going to be any homelessness unless we turn our backs and let it happen,'' he told another. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has acknowledged the need for more affordable housing, without promising any more federal spending to build it. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget proposal for fiscal 1990 contains no new spending on public housing, and the budget deficit provides little reason for housing advocates to expect even <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> can come up with new spending initiatives Some Democrats have begun to suggest that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, with his visibility and big talk, has overplayed his hand. `` He has clearly upstaged the president, and that is usually not smart politics,'' <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said. `` He runs the risk of overpromising himself early,'' <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> added. `` He's setting himself up for a long fall.'' Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> seemed to be offering <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> a similar caution as well when they met with the city's black leaders. `` From everything we've heard you say, we think you mean business,'' she said. `` If something happens and there is not the follow through, you're going to have a lot of disappointed people.''

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliate is n't inviting the network back to its newsroom next <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> because the network's report focused on the city's crime problem and was `` misleading and very superficial,'' the affiliate's news director said. `` Our video files will not be open to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, nor will any editing facilities or satellite equipment be available. Any story you do, you will do on your own. You wo n't have our help,'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, news director of local affiliate <ORGANIZATION> WWL </ORGANIZATION>, said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> wrote to protest a report on `` CBS Evening News'' done by correspondent <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Zant </PERSON> during <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> earlier this month. The report `` began with a brief mention of our Mardi Gras celebration, and juxtaposed that with a series of murder scenes and a long discussion of our crime problems,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> wrote. Although there has been an increase in murders this year, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said that `` to combine the elements of <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gras </LOCATION> and the crime problem in a very quick piece creates a simplistic, misleading and very superficial look at our city and in no way reflects what the community is doing to solve the problem.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON>, a network spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Saturday he was not familiar with the situation and could not comment. He referred calls to another spokesman, but a message left on his telephone answering machine was n't returned. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> had almost a slaying a day during January and police said they found the body of the 34th victim of the year Saturday. Police have blamed the increase on drugs. <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which had sent its own letter of complaint to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, commended <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> for his strong protest and asked residents to boycott CBS programming for two weeks. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> thanked the council but asked viewers to delay the boycott until after the ratings period in March.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told new officers Sunday to shun coup plots and urged them to crush communist rebels and other `` enemies of freedom'' who refuse to settle disputes with her government peacefully. `` Those who sapped the strength of this country will ask you to join them in exploiting its weaknesses,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told 113 graduating cadets during commencement exercises at the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, 150 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. `` Ignore them,'' she ordered. `` Ignore them out of patriotism, ingore them out of prudence. This country, this government and this leader have more strength than appearances suggest.'' Graduates of the nation's only military academy spearheaded the six armed attempts to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> since she took power in the February 1986 civilian-military uprising against President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Troops here and in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> were placed on maximum alert in advance of Sunday's commencement because of rumors that right-wing extremists would launch a new coup attempt. Hundreds of troops, some of them flown here from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, guarded strategic points near the mountain-top academy. Bomb-sniffing dogs checked cadets before the ceremony began under brillantly clear skies. In March 1987, a bomb exploded on the academy parade ground a few days before the commencement, killing four people and injuring nine others. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said the bomb was intended for her. In her speech, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told the cadets it was their duty to protect democratic gains from both communist rebels and right-wing extremists in their ranks. `` Fight them wherever they appear and threaten our people, our work that we are striving to make of this country,'' she said. She challenged the cadets to join with civilian authorities in healing the nation's wounds and building democracy. `` To the enemies of freedom, the armed opponents of our government on the left and the right, I address these words: Let us sit down and try to settle our differences by talk,'' she said. `` And if we can not, by all means, let us do so by arms. But let us not infect the next generation in civil society and in the armed forces with narrow causes and hatreds of the past.''

I think he's -LRB- Atwater -RRB- typical of some the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leadership ... in that he does n't really have his finger on the pulse of the people, and know what a real Republican is,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s campaign manager <PERSON> Howie </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a broadcast interview. `` I think that he's way off base, and needs to reassess where he stands. When the dust settles, I think he'll find that he's probably further out of the mainstream of Republicanism than is <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>.'' In unofficial results Saturday night, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> narrowly defeated homebuilder <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> to represent a state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> district in <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> registered with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> two days before qualifying to run in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> race. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> also is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said that if <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> is officially certified the winner, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> will call a meeting of the party's executive committee within the next week to consider a motion of censure against <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> The motion proposes that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` reject and condemn <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, his beliefs and the hate and fear he promotes, and reaffirm its commitment to equal opportunity for all regardless of race, creed, religion, sex or national origin.''

Nearly 78 percent of the voters turned out for the runoff election. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> in a statement issued Saturday night by <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> is not a Republican,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. `` He's a pretender, a charlatan and a political opportunist who is looking for any organization he can find to try to legitimize his views of racial and religious bigotry and intolerance. `` We repudiate him in his views and we are taking immediate steps to see that he is disenfranchised from our party.'' <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said that if <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> is certified the winner, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> will call a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> executive committee to present a formal motion for censure, which <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said would be an unprecedented action. Asked about <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s remarks, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said: `` He ca n't do that. Who does he think he is? The people have spoken.'' Three of the candidates who lost in the primary have said they would file a lawsuit if <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> won, challenging whether he lived in the district for a year, as required by state law. Democrat State Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s election would probably be challenged by the legislature on the residency issue. <PERSON> Howie </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said his camp was concerned that <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>'s supporters might try to tamper with voting machines before the result is certified. `` All they got ta do is flip a button here, a button there, and it's a new race,'' he said. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> won 33 percent of the vote to lead a field of seven in the Jan. 21 primary. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> got 19 percent. Under <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s open primary system, the top two vote-getters in a primary, regardless of party, face each other in a runoff if no candidate receives more than half the vote. The seat opened up when <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION>'s representative was elected to a judgeship with about three years left in a four-year term. The election returned the spotlight to <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, who in the 1970s was photographed in a Nazi uniform and boldly removed the hood of his white robe to become an international spokesman for the Klan. It's an era that <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> claimed to be sorry for, but <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> said he did n't believe that. `` I regret it because ... people might think I'm racially or religiously intolerant,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> left the Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, accused by another leader of selling secret membership rolls. He formed the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, which he says is a civil rights organization for everyone. The final days of the race brought renewed charges that <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> still was associated with right-wing extremists, including ex-American Nazi leader <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> acknowledged <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> had been campaign manager in his 1988 bid for the presidency as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Populist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In the general election, he ran in 15 states and drew less than .05 percent of the national total vote. He began his presidential bid as a Democrat but was repudiated by party officials. He got no delegates at the Democratic National Convention. Two days before qualifying for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> race, he registered with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also rejected him. Fearful the charismatic <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> would overshadow the mild-mannered <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>, the committee enlisted their top two politicians in the 11th hour of the campaign _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ to try to keep <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> from going to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> as a member of their party. The backing from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is unprecedented in a local legislative race, state and national <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Locally, an archbishop, senators, a university president and Democrats voiced their support for <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> or their opposition to <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. Letters from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promoting <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>'s candidacy arrived at most homes in the district by election day. `` I ca n't help but tell you of the high regard I have for one candidate in the race for the 81st district _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in the heavily played radio spot. The race also attracted international attention, with reporters from British, Dutch, French, West German and other foreign newspapers covering it. <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> was state campaign chairman for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1980 presidential bid. His brother, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON>, was <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> governor from 1980 to 1984. He also was a member of the State's <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> in the 1950s, which he said was not formed as a racist group although many members were segregationists. `` I left that behind a long time ago,'' <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> said. Despite the celebrity of the race, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> property taxes remained a key issue. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> promised to reject any attempts to reduce the state's $ 75,000 homestead exemption <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> supports Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s plans to revise the state tax code, plans that could include raising property taxes by reducing the homestead exemption

 A bus skidded out of control on a rain-slickened highway and rolled over Saturday, killing four passengers and injuring 20, four critically, authorities said. `` It rolled over about two times, tossing victims out through the windows,'' said paramedic <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stover </PERSON>, the first to arrive after the 3:45 a.m. crash. Only four people managed to stay inside the vehicle, and one of those died of injuries sustained as the bus tumbled, he said. Four of the injured, including a 5-year-old girl, were in critical condition and were transported to <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> hospitals by helicopter and ambulances. The accident happened as the bus rounded a curve about six to seven miles south of <LOCATION> Falfurrias </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 281, <PERSON> Stover </PERSON> said. Officials were trying to determine what caused the <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> bus to crash, but were sure that the wet roadway was a factor. `` We did have rainy weather,'' said <PERSON> Melinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a dispatcher for the <LOCATION> Brooks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department in <LOCATION> Falfurrias </LOCATION>, about 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. `` It was pretty bad out there.''

He said he spoke to a man and woman who sustained minor cuts. `` They both told me the bus slid sideways into the ditch, rolled once, and then the bus continued on over again,'' he said. Killed in the crash was <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Concepcion </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON>, whose age was n't known, <PERSON> Stover </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> declared a nationwide state of emergency Saturday and replaced seven non-party members of Cabinet in moves apparently aimed at consolidating his party's power. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> blamed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to Afghan guerrillas in part for the state of emergency, which sharply reins in civil liberties. The emergency was announced on state-run radio and television by <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, who said it was needed `` to ensure peace and security'' in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. It came three days after the last Soviet soldiers, who had been backing <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s army in its war with Moslem guerrillas, left the country. On Saturday night, Dari-language television and radio announced <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s shakeup of seven non-party members of 28-member Cabinet, a move confirmed by the government Sunday. Replaced were the ministers of higher education, commerce, education, light industries and foodstuffs, public health, civil aviation and repatriation. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, however, appointed a non-party member to become minister for Islamic affairs, a post that had been created in October but was vacant. Five other posts are held by non-members of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> The government also ordered 500 party members in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to report for military duty in an effort to maintain security in the capital. During the day Saturday, troops, tanks and armored personnel carriers appeared at most intersections in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and soldiers were stationed on the roofs of buildings. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> told foreign journalists that under the state of emergency, troops would have the right to open fire if they believed reporters or photographers were behaving suspiciously. The city of 2.25 million people remained relatively calm. But guerrillas surround <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and many diplomats believe the government will collapse shortly. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, Afghan guerrilla leaders nominated <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammadi </PERSON> as acting president and <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> as acting prime minister of an interim government that would take over if <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government fell. A special council of 400 delegates was to formally approve the appointments Sunday. Afghan government radio reported that five people were killed and four injured Saturday in rocket attacks mounted by Moslem guerrillas in various parts of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The state of emergency allows the government to suspend or limit constitutional rights that protect against confiscation of property and searches of property; provide for confidentiality of corresondence and telephone conversations; allow peaceful assembly and demonstrations; protect freedom of expression; and provide for freedom from compulsory labor. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said the emergency was `` temporary,'' but he did not set a time limit. Under the constitution, an emergency can last three months but can be extended with the consent of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said clandestine activities that were terrorizing the Afghan people prompted the declaration. Speaking at a news briefing, he said these activities included the circulation of `` night letters'' _ unsigned pamphlets warning residents to stay off the streets, close their businesses, and stay away from the airport. `` These created an air in which people were being terrified of a rocket attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> also said the refusal of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to halt the supply of arms to the rebels made the state of emergency necessary. A state of emergency has been imposed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> once before, in 1978, after the communists seized power in a military coup. It was lifted in 1979, the same year Soviet troops intervened in the civil war. The Soviets announced all their troops had been withdrawn Wednesday, the deadline set by a U.N.-mediated accord signed last year. The guerrillas were not a party to the accord and have vowed to overthrow <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government. The constitution allows the government to declare an emergency when it deems that the country's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and internal security are impossible to maintain due to war, danger of war, disturbances of war or similar conditions.

 Police raided the home of black activist <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> on Sunday and said they took fingerprints and found traces of blood. Four of her bodyguards were arrested. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Jaap </PERSON> <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON>, who is heading the investigation into the death of a 14-year-old black activist who was allegedly abducted and beaten at the house, said the fingerprints and blood samples would be tested. Police also took bags of clothes belonging to her bodyguards, four of whom were arrested. More than 20 policemen with rifles surrounded and guarded the house during the eight-hour search. Police searched through Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s belongings, but did not take any of them, said a journalist at the scene. <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON>, who directed the search, is also investigating the disappearance of two young men last seen in the company of Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s bodyguards in November, and the slaying of a <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> doctor who is reported to have seen the 14-year-old boy after he was beaten. Police spokesman Col. L.J. <PERSON> Haasbroek </PERSON> said two people had been arrested in connection with the doctor's slaying, but would not say whether they were among the four bodyguards detained Sunday. He would not elaborate. The Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general-secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday that Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> had decided to remove the young bodyguards from her home, after receiving such orders from her husband, jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. The raid came one day after a minister said Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> agreed to remove from her home bodyguards accused of abducting and beating 14-year-old <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 54, is the wife of jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. He urged his wife to get rid of the bodyguards during her visit Wednesday at a prison farm near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, according to the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Council of Churches. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 70, has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government. Major anti-apartheid organizations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have dissociated themselves from Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, whom they accuse of `` complicity'' in the abduction and beating of the teen-ager. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, smiling and cheerful, came out to greet reporters during the raid and offered them refreshments. She made no comment when the raid ended. Her secretary said she was resting. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> formed the <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> soccer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> club </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, saying she wanted to provide recreation for youths congregating on streets. But they grew into a organization of bodyguard who antagonized the community. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has referred to the soccer team's activities as `` unbecoming,'' whereas leaders in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> accused it of waging a `` reign of terror'' in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. The controversy over the soccer club came to a head last month when three men told a community meeting of 150 top anti-apartheid activists that the bodyguards had dragged them to the <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> home and beaten them. The men said <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON> was with them, but was hurt more seriously and was taken away after two days. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has said she was not home when the abductions occurred.

Explosions of hidden land mines are common, both in the Sinai and in the western desert, which also was a battle zone in World War II.

The city council's excavation unit wants to explore the burial ground before it is developed into a parking lot and shopping center. <PERSON> Aiken </PERSON> said he has asked the developer for a donation to help pay for the excavation. `` We have been advised by the Health and Safety Executive that smallpox ... germs can stay alive underground indefinitely,'' said <PERSON> Atkin </PERSON>. `` The site will be completely screened off from the public during the dig.'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> declared smallpox eradicated in 1980.

 Twenty Chinese lawmakers have condemned a futuristic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television cartoon as poison and urged the government to ban broadcasts of `` The Transformers'' and its toy characters, a report said Sunday. The legislators `` believe that the absurd ideological content of ` The Transformers,' especially its promotion uristic cartoon about robots who can alter their shapes to become cars, planes and weapons, and who battle other evil robots. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said it has been shown on <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> television in translation, and several publishing houses have issued picture books of characters from the cartoon. U.S.-made toys of the cartoon characters also have been sold in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for the `` excessively expensive'' price of about $ 270 per set _ nearly as much as the average Chinese worker makes in a year, the news agency said. The legislators who objected to the program and toys are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which meets periodically between annual sessions of the full congress. The reports did not say if any government department had responded to the appeal or if the legislators planned to push for the whole congress to take some action on it. The congress has had a real voice in drafting and approving laws only for the past few years, but legislation still is proposed by government ministries or the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, not individual legislators.

<TEXT>
 Doctors at private hospitals and clinics have gone on strike to demand better work conditions and improvement of nationwide medical services. Earlier this month, doctors at public medical facilities went on a three-day strike for similar demands. The one-week strike by the Doctors' Union began Saturday. A statement issued by the union said all private hospitals and clinics would be closed `` except for the strictest emergency cases.'' The doctors are threatening to resign if their demands are not met.

<HEAD>Poll Finds Los Angeles Residents See Decline In Quality Of Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Residents of the nation's second largest city think violent crime, smog and traffic jams are lowering the quality of life, according to a survey. About half of 2,046 residents polled said they considered moving elsewhere in the past year because of the intangible slide in their lifestyle, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. Sixty percent of those interviewed by telephone said life has changed for the worse during the past 15 years. Only 17 percent believe things have gotten better. Seventy-eight percent said crime is the metropolitan area's worst problem and 46 percent said they do not feel safe walking in their own neighborhoods at night. The newspaper survey was conducted during the second week of February. The study has a 3 percent margin of error, said I.A. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, the poll director. Blacks were the most fearful of crime, with 95 percent identifying it as the region's worst problem. Fifty-four percent of blacks polled said they do not feel safe on their neighborhood streets at night. Similar fears were voiced by 44 percent of the whites surveyed, and 38 percent of the Hispanics. The poll showed increasing pessimism since a survey in March 1986, when 70 percent reported things were going well or fairly well. Fifty-two percent said things were going well in the latest survey. After crime, traffic congestion, air pollution and growing population were the major issues targeted for criticism. Blacks, the minority group hardest hit by unemployment, also cited the economy as a major problem.

<HEAD>Sex-Offender Clown Given Probation, Undergoing Self-Punishment Therapy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A professional clown who admitted trying to pay a teen-age boy to have sex with him has been given probation with orders that he continue therapy including punishing himself with ammonia or electric shock to inhibit such urges. The sentence given Friday to <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthow </PERSON>, 56, who works as a clown at children's parties, was criticized by Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Karla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, who sought a prison term because <PERSON> Matthow </PERSON> is a two-time offender. While in prison for a similar sex offense, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Matthow </PERSON> advertised for boys, ostensibly to serve as apprentices, but actually to use for sex. `` I do n't think there is any way the court can ensure that young boys wo n't be victimized by this defendant again,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said after court recessed. District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Toth </PERSON> said the five-year probation term was proper because the therapy <PERSON> Matthow </PERSON> has been undergoing is `` worse punishment than anything our prison system offers.'' Since November, when <PERSON> Matthow </PERSON> admitted asking a 17-year-old boy to engage in sex for money, <PERSON> Matthow </PERSON> has been voluntarily under treatment at the <ORGANIZATION> Behavioral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. His treatment includes sniffing ammonia or enduring an electric shock whenever he has an urge to have sex with an adolescent male. At first, the treatment was supervised by the staff. Institute officials say <PERSON> Matthow </PERSON> has progressed to where he is allowed to inflict the punishment himself and document the punishment by tape recording it. He is currently an outpatient at the institute, under surveillance by institute staff who make sure he is acting normally, institute officials said. The technique is widely recognized for treating people who are attracted sexually to children, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanzotti </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> probation officer who recommended probation for <PERSON> Matthow </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> psychiatrist <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>, who is nationally known for his work with sex offenders, said of the institute's approach: `` It's OK.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the aftermath of a landmark, $ 21.75 million jury award, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> thinks about his former lover, <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, and the question that haunts him still: `` Why did he do it?'' Why did <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> hide from Christian the secret that went to bed with them for eight months: that the movie star had AIDS? `` I do n't know why he did it,'' Christian reflected. `` He took that to the grave with him. I do n't know if he just could n't face the fact that he was dying. A lot of people do n't believe in their mortality when they're famous. You see your image up there on the screen and maybe he thought he would live forever.'' Or maybe, he said, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> was used to having others handle his problems. `` He had been a star since he was 23. Everything in his life was delegated,'' <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I think he had some help in making the decision not to tell me. But even if others were trying to influence him, he should have been man enough to tell me.'' <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, 35, who sued <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s estate and secretary for emotional distress, was awarded $ 14.5 million Wednesday and an additional $ 7.25 million in punitive damages Friday. Born in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and raised in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> thought of becoming a baseball player, tried being a rock musician and, with his blond good looks, dabbled in acting and modeling. He was working on a music history project and volunteering in political campaigns when he met <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> in 1982. He maintains that the actor's fame meant `` almost nothing'' to him. Living in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, he had gone to high school with several actors. `` Fame for me was a turnoff,'' he said. `` I had met a lot of stars who were in love with themselves, and I had no idea if Rock would be shallow. `` But the first time we spent in this apartment, listening to music, I almost forgot he was famous. He was so really down to earth. He made me feel at ease.'' Later, when they became live-in lovers, he said, `` I did n't think about the fame much. Sometimes it was fun to be caught in the afterglow of it. We would go out to dinner and someone would ask him for an autograph.'' His sweet memories turn bitter when he discusses what he now knows _ that <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> concealed his AIDS diagnosis from him while they continued to have sex. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, 58, died on Oct. 5, 1985, three months after the public and <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> learned he had the deadly, sexually transmittable disease. `` He made a tragic decision not to tell me,'' said <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>. `` Aside from that he was a very nice, generous man. But it's outrageous I really resent the fact he did n't tell me.'' Christian has tested negative for exposure to the AIDS virus but said he fears contracting the disease. `` If I'm carrying AIDS, I'm dead,'' he said `` If I do n't come down with it, he has put me through three years of hell.'' He has been celibate since he learned of <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s diagnosis, he said. He said filing suit was traumatic. `` I initially asked the estate for $ 300,000,'' Christian recalled. `` I said, ` If I get AIDS, I have no health insurance, and I'll need that,' but they refused.'' <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said the lawsuit's message is simple: People with AIDS have a duty to warn their sexual partners. The jury's verdict probably will be appealed, but <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said: `` The message has already gone out. The impact that jury had ca n't be erased Even if I do n't get a dime out of it, it does n't matter.'' He vowed to contribute a large portion of his award to AIDS groups, mainly hospices. `` Maybe I'll be able to do what <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> should have done,'' he said.

<HEAD>Daley's Lead in Mayoral Race Narrowing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Increasing support from black voters has enabled Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> to narrow the lead held by his rival in the mayoral <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, according to two new polls. A poll conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WLS-TV </ORGANIZATION> found <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> leading 50 percent to 38 percent, with 10 percent undecided and the remaining 2 percent split among two minor candidates. Five weeks ago, that poll found <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney, leading 51 percent to 27 percent A poll conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and published in Sunday editions put <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s lead over <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> at 45 percent to 37 percent among likely voters in the Feb. 28 Democratic primary. Seventeen percent said they were undecided. The Democratic primary historically determines the victor in the general election in this overwhelmingly Democratic city. `` This campaign is winding down and we're moving up,'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said Saturday at a meeting of Operation PUSH with its founder, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It's very encouraging.'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, son of the late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, spent part of Saturday walking through one of his strongholds on the city's <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> `` I said this is going to a very close election,'' said <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. `` These people down here react more to shaking-hand appearances than to polls.'' The biggest swing by voters in the recent <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll compared with last month's poll was among blacks. Support for <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, who is black, jumped from 47 percent in January to 77 percent in the most recent poll. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who is white, was supported by 11 percent of black voters polled, down from 19 percent five weeks ago. At the same time, however, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> increased his support among white voters by 5 percent and Hispanics voters by 3 percent, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll of 1,001 registered voters questioned Feb. 10-14. The margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points. The Sun-Times-WLS-TV poll was completed just before the withdrawal from the race of <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, and before <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>'s endorsement of <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. The newspaper said preliminary responses of people asked their second choices for mayor showed <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> could get almost equal numbers of Bloom supporters. The <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> poll found <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>'s black supporters moving to <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> by a 4-to-1 margin and his white backers splitting between <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. The poll of 1,017 registered voters likely to cast ballots was conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prospect </ORGANIZATION>, and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points. The Democratic and Republican nominees will compete in the April 4 general election with <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who skipped the primary and is running as a third-party candidate. The endosed <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate is Dr. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>, a North Side physician.

 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, seeking to tighten his grip on the government and military, will form and lead a supreme military council to coordinate the armed forces' fight against Moslem guerrillas, the foreign minister said Sunday. The announcement came a day after <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> declared a nationwide state of emergency and replaced seven members of his Cabinet who were not members of his ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, guerrillas trying to form their own interim government failed to agree on a Cabinet list, and several delegates walked out of a meeting. Guerrillas also claimed to have captured a provincial capital in central <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, taking government soldiers prisoner and seizing arms and ammunition. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio the military council will coordinate economic and military activities and will be formed `` in the next few days.'' He said the new council will not replace the Cabinet. <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> also said the emergency declared Saturday night was a precautionary measure and a `` sign of strength, not weakness.'' New security measures will include house searches, he said. Foreign ministry officials said seven members of the ruling party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> are replacing the ousted non-party ministers. `` We wanted to give a sign to the counterrevolutionaries and show them the party is not finished,'' one senior party member said on condition of anonymity. `` We are stronger than ever.'' A diplomat who refused to be identified further said the reshuffle and emergency indicate <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> will be harder to remove from power. `` He has surrounded himself with his people. He's showing that he's now in charge, he's calling the shots now that the Soviets are gone,'' said the diplomat. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> withdrew the last of its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Wednesday under terms of a U.N.-mediated accord. They had been in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> for nine years backing <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> in his war with Moslem guerrillas. There still are 10 non-party members in the Cabinet, including Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharq </PERSON>, his deputy and two vice presidents. The Pakistan-based guerrillas, who Saturday nominated leaders of a government-in-exile in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, have vowed to bring down <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> now that the Soviets are gone. Moderate guerrilla factions walked out of the guerrilla council session Sunday that was to approve the nominations. They opposed the nomination of hardliner <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> as prime minister. The council, or shura, was scheduled to reconvene Monday in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. Rebels said Sunday their combined forces captured <PERSON> Tarin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kot </PERSON>, provincial capital of the remote central province of <LOCATION> Uruzgan </LOCATION>, along with `` many'' government troops and a large quantity of arms and ammunition in a battle Friday. There was no independent confirmation of the report, which was carried by the Afghan News Agency, a rebel medium based in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tarin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kot </PERSON> is 60 miles from the nearest key highway and has little strategic importance. But its capture would bring to six the number of provincial capitals to fall to the insurgents since Soviet forces began leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15. The guerrillas are said to control 90 percent of the countryside, but <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s troops still hold most urban centers. More troops, tanks and armored personnel carriers appeared on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> streets Sunday morning. Few Afghans seemed to notice. Many soldiers sat smoking cigarettes, reading newspapers or sipping tea next to their vehicles. The state of emergency allows the government to suspend or limit constitutional rights that protect against confiscation and searches of property; provide for confidentiality of correspondence and telephone conversations; allow peaceful assembly and demonstrations; protect freedom of expression; and provide for freedom from compulsory labor. <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Danish </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, replaces <PERSON> Nur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Barlets </PERSON> as minister of higher education in <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s Cabinet. <PERSON> Burhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasi </PERSON>, who was higher education minister in a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, was chosen to replace <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jalalar </PERSON> as minister of commerce. <PERSON> Khodaidad </PERSON> <PERSON> Basharmall </PERSON> is the new education minister, ousting <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasul </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Baharr </PERSON> succeeds <PERSON> Isaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawah </PERSON> as minister of light industries and foodstuffs. <PERSON> Shirjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazdorarr </PERSON>, who was transport minister, was picked to replace <PERSON> Pachqul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wafadarr </PERSON> as civil aviation minister.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Security staff at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> began searching for a bomb hidden in a radio-cassette player on Nov. 22, one month before such a device destroyed <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, The Sunday Telegraph reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had warned airline security staff to look for a Japanese-made radio-cassette player containing sheets of the powerful, Czech-made explosive Semtex, the newspaper said. It cited only unidentified sources at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> for its report. It said the warning came after police in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> raided 16 houses and apartments occupied by suspected radical Palestinians on Oct. 27 and found an air pressure-activated bomb hidden in a radio. Police investigating the Dec. 21 explosion of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 said last week they believe a radio-cassette player hid explosives that blew up the plane over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> publicly advised all airlines using British airports to examine passengers' radios, computers or other electronic or electrical equipment for possible bombs. A spokesman said the recommendation was aimed mainly at battery-operated transistor radios, lap-top computers and cassette recorders in which explosives could be hidden, rather than smaller electrical items such as hair dryers. The Sunday Telegraph said that following the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s fall warning, security technicians at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> built a replica of the suspected device and used it to train staff. It quoted unidentified sources at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> memo warned of a <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> `` Beat Bomb'' player which would have two different types of batteries, but would not play. `` It would have two actuating devices, the first a timer which would activate the second, a barometric device,'' the newspaper said. `` This would detonate the explosives once the aircraft reached a predetermined height.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Sunday, `` We do n't comment on advice we give to airlines, and all we're saying is, as with all warnings, the threat was assessed and appropriate advice issued to the industry.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is facing a shortage of money and a reorganization that could lead to the closing of many local weather offices over the next several years. The money available for the current fiscal year likely wo n't cover costs, and the budget under discussion for next year could be even worse At the same time, administrators are trying to complete a long-range reorganization plan aimed at consolidating offices through the use of new electronic equipment. The Weather Service currently has nearly 250 local offices across the country and administrators hope to keep most of them running for at least the next few years while automated observation equipment can be purchased and installed. Then, closings could be phased in gradually, perhaps taking as long as a decade, according to agency officials. But the budget crunch is more immediate. The current fiscal year is expected to end with the <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> short between $ 10 million and $ 28 million. The shortfall has prompted a hiring freeze and a search for other savings, according to several <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> spending proposed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for fiscal 1990, meanwhile, was set at $ 1.14 billion, down from $ 1.19 billion in the current fiscal year. While the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s portion of the <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> budget increases slightly under the budget, that includes money to buy new radar and observation equipment and a supercomputer. According to congressional sources, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposal called for closing as many as 62 local weather offices this year and 77 more next year as part of a consolidation move that would shift many specialized forecasting tasks to private weather services. Congressional sources said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration may be reconsidering whether such sharp cuts are needed and that discussions are underway to keep the local weather offices open, for the time being anyway. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee that oversees <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> said that some closings may occur in any case where stations are located fairly close together. Once new automated equipment is in place more extensive office closings will be easier to defend because weather forecasting would not be hindered, <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> officials say. But that would occur over several years, perhaps as long as a decade. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has said that the long-term closings could affect 100 offices or more. And <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> officials privately admit that after the reorganization is complete they expect to have fewer than 150 local offices, instead of the nearly 250 today. The long-term <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> modernization plan was scheduled to be sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this week, but has been delayed partly because of the change in administrations which has caused confusion over who will be in top policy-making decisions at the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Concerned members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, who want some answers about the direction the weather agency is going, complained that they do n't know who at Commerce to call for hearings.

<HEAD>Nixon Warns Bush to Move Cautiously in U.S.-Soviet Relations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> says that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has the chance to `` effect a sea-change in the U.S.-Soviet relationship'' but should beware of moving incautiously or giving too much away to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, who dealt with then-Soviet leaders <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, has also met with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, describing him as `` in a class of his own. He is their match in tenacity and forcefulness, but outstrips them in realism, quickness and intelligence.'' `` We must keep in mind that his talent and capabilities can just as easily make the world a more dangerous place as they can contribute to greater global security,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> wrote of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the current edition of the magazine `` Foreign Affairs.'' `` While his reforms give reason for a reappraisal of the West's policy toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, we must bear in mind that the causes of the cold war _ <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s domination of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and aggressive foreign policies around the world _ still endure,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> wrote `` Those who parrot today a fashionable slogan _ ` the cold war is over' _ trivialize the problems of Western security, `` wrote <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, who was forced to resign as president in August 1974 during the Watergate scandal. `` We must make <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> choose between a less confrontational relationship with the West and the retention of his imperial control over <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, between a continuing race in arms technology and arms control agreements that could create a stable strategic and conventional balance, and between access to Western credits and continuing Soviet adventures in the Third World,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> wrote. In the 20-page article, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> offered a host of suggestions for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Key among them were a proposal to meet early with the heads of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies to formulate joint arms and trade policies toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> before agreeing to a summit with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> chief. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> needs a summit far more than the president,'' said <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. `` It is imperative,'' the former president wrote, that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the other leaders of the industrialized democracies `` issue a joint statement, in conjunction with -LRB- joint -RRB- arms control proposals that educates their publics on the nature and scope of the Soviet threat.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had some harsh words for former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> because of proposals that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> endorsed at the <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> summit in 1986 for the eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons and the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reduction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> now under negotiation. The danger in the draft treaty, wrote <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, is that it reduces the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> targets more drastically and quickly than it cuts Soviet land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles `` which are first strike weapons.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has suspended those negotiations pending review of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategic policies, and White House national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> aide, has made statements similar to those in the `` Foreign Affairs'' article. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> wrote that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must repeat his formulation that progress in reducing nuclear arsenals be linked to reducing the sizable Soviet edge in conventional forces. The American president should demand that any treaty require sharp cuts in heavy Soviet ICBM's and at the same time move ahead with deployment of a single-warhead <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ICBM. Such a step would reduce the number of Soviet warheads and launchers while increasing the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> targets, producing greater stability, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> maintained. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> also urged the administration to continue the support of anti-communist guerrillas in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and to press <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to withdraw Soviet support for pro-Kremlin regimes in those nations.

<HEAD>Pipeline Leak Sends Poisonous Gas Cloud Over Siberia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pipeline in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> leaked a huge mushroom-shaped cloud of lethal, flammable gas that threatened two villages, but a helicopter crew exploded the cloud before it injured anyone, Pravda reported Sunday. The Communist Party daily said the `` poisonous and explosive fog'' was detonated by a rescue crew in an MI8 helicopter who fired a flare pistol into it. That touched off a thunderous explosion and a fire that shot more than 300 feet into the air and measured nearly 2,000 feet in diameter, the paper said. <PERSON> Prvada </PERSON> said no one happened to be in the vicinity of the fire, which eventually burned out itself. The leak in the pipeline carrying pressurized propane, ethane, hexane and other light hydrocarbons from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> region of central <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> took place Tuesday night, Pravda said. When the gas, which was liquified at a pressure of 75 pounds per square inch, escaped from the pipeline, it turned into a `` mushroom-shaped cloud ready to explode at any second,'' Pravda said. Noticing a sharp drop in pressure, the pipeline crew shut down all compressor stations on the pipeline within 10 minutes, and the helicopter set off to look for the poisonous cloud, the paper said. Its crew found a white fog suspended in the air 120 miles from the city of <LOCATION> Tobolsk </LOCATION>, which is 1,200 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. The cloud threatened a railway station and two small villages, so the helicopter crew decided to detonate it, Pravda said. `` For many kilometers, it became as light as in broad daylight,'' it said. Fire engines, bulldozers, excavators, tractors and more than 30 workers set off from the petroleum center of <LOCATION> Tyumen </LOCATION>, 150 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tobolsk </LOCATION>, for the site of the explosion, according to Pravda. By the time they arrived, the fire had subsided, and it died out completely a day later, the newspaper said. It said the damaged section of the pipeline was replaced.

<HEAD>Self-Described `Monster' On Trial For Attempted Murder Of Prison
Guard</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A self-described `` monster,'' a thrill killer at 15 whose reputation is that of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s most dangerous inmate, is defending himself at his attempted murder trial and trying to put the system on trial. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, charged with stabbing a prison guard, is shackled hand and foot in court but when he sits down at the defense table, he flashes a smile at reporters and surveys the scene before turning his attention to the neatly prepared files on his desk. He's not proclaiming innocence _ he admitted in opening arguments that he stabbed the guard. Articulate and intelligent at the trial, <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> said he hopes his appearance will focus attention on problems he perceives within the state's legal system. He says he stabbed the guard to retaliate against injustices committed against him in prison, but the prosecutor calls him a master manipulator. `` Each and every day I stand in this courtroom, I laugh at this system because there ai n't a damn thing that it can do to me except to deal with the monster that it has created,'' <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> said in his opening statement. Courtrooms are nothing new for <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON>, 26, who has been shuffled in and out of the legal system since he was 9 years old. `` I'm a monster that's come back to haunt this system and I will dog this system until it is in its grave,'' <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> promised in 1987. At the time the guard was stabbed at the <ORGANIZATION> Shawangunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> on April 16, 1988, <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> was serving 25 years to life for assault, arson and being a persistent felon. He also had three years remaining to serve on a previous conviction. In 1978, at age 15, <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> prompted legislators to change the way the state treats violent juveniles when he murdered two men and injured another in an eight-day crime spree. He told authorities he did it `` for the experience.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> called him a `` willful, mad-dog killer.'' <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> was tried as a juvenile and sentenced to only five years. But later that year, bowing to public pressure, then-Gov. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> enacted tougher juvenile laws that allow teen-agers under 16 to be tried as adults for violent crimes. <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, the product of a broken home. He never knew his father, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, who graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> while a federal prison inmate and eventually died in an escape attempt. He once boasted to a detective that he had a record of robbery arrests that began when he was 9. By age 10, he had been convicted of attacking a younger child with a knife and sent to a detention center. At age 12, <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> was diagnosed by a psychiatrist as an `` emotional zombie.'' After the guard was stabbed, a special `` box'' cell was built for <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Woodbourne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sullivan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. His meals are slipped in through a slot cut into iron bars. Television cameras monitor his every move, 24 hours a day. When <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> leaves his cell for any reason, he must first stick his feet through a slot to be manacled and then his hands to be cuffed. Three guards watch him when he gets his daily hour of exercise, alone in a small, fenced-in area. The prisoner's hands and feet remain manacled. Ulster County Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> also must remain in shackles during this trial, his hands and legs manacled and linked to a chain around his waist. In spite of those restraints, <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> has conducted his cross-examinations with intelligent, articulate questions. Referring to himself in the third-person, he has strayed from a professional demeanor only occasionally, smiling or chuckling to himself when something did not go his way. `` He clearly has established intelligence and also knowledge of the courtroom,'' Chief Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said during a break in the trial Thursday. `` I'm not surprised. He's one of the most manipulative people I've ever come across,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> added. `` Appearances can be deceiving.'' When it's all over, <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> knows he will return to his cell, where even the guards are forbidden to talk to him. If convicted, <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> could be sentenced to another prison term of up to 25 years to life, which would have to be served consecutively to his present sentence.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Just a 20-minute walk east of the spires of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s financial district and the dome of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, signs of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> give way to the sounds and smells of the Asian subcontinent. The mosque's wailing call to prayer drowns out the toll of the church bell, swishing sari robes replace pin stripes and the smell of roast lamb and spice fills the air in <LOCATION> Brick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION> _ the `` new world'' for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s latest immigrants, people from <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. The first arrivals stepped off boats three decades ago and settled in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION> neighborhood. Like the Jews once predominant in <LOCATION> Brick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>, the Bangladeshis have struggled to learn English, find shelter and work, and preserve their culture. A century ago Brick Lane was an area of infamous squalor, where <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Ripper </PERSON> stalked his victims. Its Jewish residents began leaving after it was heavily bombed during World War II. Now, 160,000 Bangladeshis, the single largest concentration in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, inhabit the low-built houses and narrow streets. They have built five mosques in a square-mile area, and opened leather shops and grocery stores filled with chutneys and mangoes. The Bangladeshis also have adopted a higher profile in demanding their rights as Moslems. They want more segregation of boys and girls in public schools where their children are in the majority and government money for their private schools. Another issue these days is <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslems say slanders Islam. Not all support Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s call to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his publishers. But they vociferously denounce the novel as an insult to their faith. In many ways the issue is not about <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book, said <PERSON> Iqbal </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahhab </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, an English-language weekly. `` It was about the reassertion of Moslem values onto British society which they feel have been ignored,'' he said. The Bangladeshis have begun to think of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> as home. `` Five, 10 years ago, our people sent all money to <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and think ` I'm just working here,''' said <PERSON> Siraz </PERSON> <PERSON> Miah </PERSON>, a 28-year-old whose tiny leather factory sits above a narrow staircase strewn with leather scraps. `` Now we think it's our country. Now people have house and business. Now is better.'' Amid the acrid smell of chemicals, his 12 workers stitch 300 jackets a week on old sewing machines surrounded by head-high piles of hide. They are among the fortunate; 27 percent of East End Bangladeshis are jobless. It was factories like <PERSON> Miah </PERSON>'s that prompted <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, during a 1987 visit, to liken <PERSON> Brick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>'s workplaces to sweatshops. Something must be done, said the heir to the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> throne, and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s business community responded with $ 2.6 million in donations for projects to create jobs. Many of the earliest Bangladeshis to settle in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> were ship's cooks who had few skills and came alone, intending to return home someday Families followed, sometimes nearly a decade later because of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s tightening immigration laws, and a community grew. Now their children speak with Cockney accents. `` We have heard that Moslem girls choose boyfriends freely and go to discos. It's worrying us _ what comes next?'' said <PERSON> Daslim-Ali </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosque </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Brick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>. Others trust the collective identity forged in <LOCATION> Brick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION> to teach their children. `` Nowadays lots of Bangladeshis are here, so our children know how we behave,'' said <PERSON> Taiyabur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, 55, who came in 1959 to open the first Bangladeshi travel agency in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` As long as our children are with us, they wo n't be lost.'' But while life improves, problems remain. Racist violence, a threat wherever <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 800,000 <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> immigrants are clustered, is acute in the Tower Hamlets neighborhood. The <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamlets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION> says it received about 2,500 complaints of racial harassment in 1987, mostly involving beatings and broken windows. It also said seven Asian homes were set afire. Brick Lane still has a few reminders of its Jewish past, including an all-night bagel shop and the <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Minsky </PERSON> and Sons textile store. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Minsky </PERSON>, whose father started the business in 1902, eagerly shows a visitor around <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> stores in old tenements. `` The Asians show you how a business can be run,'' he said.

<HEAD>Players Ratify Contract, Ending Longest American Symphony Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Members of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra return to the concert hall this week after ratifying a contract that assures a minimum $ 1,040 a week in the 1991-1992 season and closes the longest strike in American symphony history. By the end of the four-year, $ 4.6 million contract, players will earn 35 percent more than the $ 770 weekly minimum they received at the end of the three-year pact that expired in September. Unlike many orchestras, the musicians in the Baltimore Symphony are paid for a 52-week year. The contract was approved late Saturday by a vote of 78-7. `` We think it's an excellent settlement and it meets the players' needs for parity with the orchestras of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON>, the players' representative in negotiations He referred to the musicians' demand that their wages be on a par with those of orchestras they consider peers. The new agreement, reached after a 22-week walkout, was agreed to after an all-day negotiating session Thursday and approved Friday by members of the <ORGANIZATION> BSO </ORGANIZATION> board. After 84 canceled concerts, the orchestra will return to its home at Meyerhoff Hall for a performance Thursday. `` Hopefully, we'll be able to face the future and become a better and deeper institution,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidwitz </PERSON>, the orchestra's executive director `` We will work so that this will never happen again.'' The $ 4.6 million cost of the contract is `` in line with the financial plan of the orchestra'' and will be paid for by `` very ambitious fund-raising,'' he said. `` Ticket prices may go up modestly, but we do not anticipate dramatic rises,'' he said. `` We want to keep them affordable.'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> player <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Landgren </PERSON> said he had lost $ 20,000 during the strike but said it was worth every penny `` because we have the satisfaction of knowing that we had to be dealt with and that we were not manipulated.'' To help bring an end to the strike, Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> pledged $ 161,000 more state support for fiscal 1990, in addition to the $ 486,000 already in the state budget proposed for next year.

<HEAD>China Plans First Permanent Nuclear Waste Dumps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is making plans to build its first permanent nuclear waste dumps in preparation for its first nuclear power stations, an official report said Sunday. The first two dumps likely will be in <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> province on the east coast, where a 300-megawatt nuclear power plant is to start operating next year, and in northwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> where nuclear weapons are tested, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily said. The newspaper quoted <PERSON> Pan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziqiang </PERSON>, director of the safety department of state-run <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, as saying that all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s nuclear waste has been put in concrete basement storage facilities good for only 10 years. He said the plan is to move the waste to proposed new facilities of steel containers buried 15 to 90 feet underground. Most of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s nuclear waste has been generated by the military, but growing amounts are being produced by scientific labs, hospitals and non-military industries. The start-up of the <LOCATION> Qinshan </LOCATION> nuclear power plant in <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> next year and of the 1,800-megawatt <LOCATION> Daya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> plant in southeast <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province by 1993 will add substantially to the amount of waste produced The <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily did not say how much nuclear waste currently is in temporary storage, the amount the new power plants will produce, nor the planned capacity of the proposed new dumps. In recent years <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has decided to turn to nuclear power to compensate for dwindling supplies of coal and other fossil fuels, which hamper economic development.

<TEXT>
 Some consumer activists are back to pushing no-fault auto insurance, but others think a more general overhaul of insurance regulation is a better way to go. No-fault emerged in the 1960s as a counter to rising premiums, slow resolution of lawsuits and paltry payments. Fourteen states adopted no-fault in one form or another, but only three _ <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> _ have the high barriers to lawsuits that characterize the pure no-fault concept. But a 60 percent premium increase in five years has made auto insurance an issue again. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters recently voted to require a 20 percent rollback. It is in this climate that no-fault is getting another look. The idea behind no-fault is that accidents are inevitable and that, often as not, who was at fault is difficult or impossible to determine. Under a no-fault plan, accident victims collect their medical expenses and wage losses from their own insurance companies without having to make a claim against the other driver, which means a lawsuit if the other driver's insurer refuses to pay. No-fault does not deal with collision, theft and other coverages. Some consumer groups believe an expansion of no-fault coverage, though beneficial, should await abolition of the insurance industry's exemptions from antitrust laws, mostly in rate-setting, and on revision of state laws limiting competition. The new no-fault drive comes from a group called `` New Start'' led by <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Knauer </PERSON>, consumer adviser to presidents <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The founders were <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, director of the Center for Consumer Affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, and a longtime no-fault activist, the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McEwen </PERSON>, professor of economics at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>.

 The Consumer Federation of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday released a poll of 1,008 people in which 72 percent of respondents believed their premiums were too high and 41 percent believed them `` much too high.'' Forty-one percent supported elimination of antitrust exemptions for insurance companies, with 26 percent opposed. No-fault insurance was supported 49 percent to 37 percent and government provision of limited-coverage, low-cost policies was backed 69 percent to 26 percent. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brobeck </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Auto insurance reform has become the consumer movement's top priority.'' End embargoed portion Organizations close to consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, such as Public Citizen and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, are skeptics on no-fault. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> himself distributed a column on auto insurance earlier this month that never mentioned no-fault, but supported the rest of the agenda backed by the consumer groups pushing widespread insurance changes. `` The most basic and longer term reform is redirecting this giant profitable industry toward loss prevention _ the constant advocacy for safer cars, better bumpers, lower repair costs from superior engineering, safer highways and drivers,'' <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, insurance specialist for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, an organization often associated with <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, said, `` Litigation ... really is n't where the major costs are.'' Thirty-five cents of every premium dollar go to administer the system, `` and no-fault would n't touch that 35 cents,'' he said. Roughly half of every insurance premium dollar is returned to claimants _ not all of whom sue _ and 15 cents goes to their lawyers, studies show. `` If all no-fault means is people are being compensated less generously, we can save plenty of money by cutting benefits 50 percent,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` No fault does n't address the real reasons for the inflation in auto insurance costs.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which he described as `` spiritually affiliated'' with <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, said, `` What we have now is a deregulated cartel,'' fixing prices to protect its least efficient members. Abolition of the antitrust exemptions would favor the efficient whose administration costs less than 30 percent of premium income, he believes. `` A truly competent package -LRB- of legislation -RRB- would save 20 to 25 percent'' of premiums through efficiencies of competition and better regulation, but no-fault itself would knock only about 5 percent off premiums, he said. `` There are only 60 actuaries in all the state insurance departments. <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> has 120,'' said <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, an actuary himself If forced to choose between no-fault and changing the regulatory scheme, `` I would take the one that saves the money,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said, and leave no-fault to later. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> backs no-fault, as do many companies. In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, it has `` reduced losses and stabilized premiums,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, who called <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION> `` a welcome addition.'' `` Every economic study done by a legitimate economist has concluded that the industry is highly competitive, especially in auto insurance,'' with hundreds of participants, he said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the differing consumer group strategies are merely `` parallel efforts'' in the same fight. `` One of the chief virtues of no-fault is prompt payment. -LRB- The Naderite strategy -RRB- does nothing to achieve that,'' Father <PERSON> McEwen </PERSON> said. It also does nothing to discourage frivolous lawsuits, which many companies settle for $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 `` just to get them out of their hair,'' he said. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> are the lawyers who collect one-third of damage awards they win, and have managed to keep no-fault at bay in state after state with the argument that no one should be deprived of the right to sue. Under no-fault, said association president <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, accident victims rapidly see `` the economic power of the insurance companies used to deprive them of all their rights.'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> believes the companies, far from throwing money at nuisance lawsuits to make them go away, resist too many claims too hard.

 Law enforcement authorities from around the country will meet this week in <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION> to compare notes, hoping to fill in more missing pieces of the puzzle left by serial killer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> before his execution last month. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> will hold the conference at its National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime. `` One of the agents was with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> prior to his death and will be sharing that information with law enforcement officials,'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said Friday in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, office. `` We have invited police officers from all over the country.'' An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> statement said the conference was being coordinated among interested law enforcement agencies who had been involved with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> before his execution. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> died Jan. 24 in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s electric chair for the 1978 slaying of sixth-grader <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` The conference had been planned for quite some time to get a resolution on some of the cases that might be out there,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. The handsome, articulate <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, a one-time law student who became the nation's best-known serial killer, for years had cockily maintained his innocence in the string of killings for which he was a suspect. But during his final days, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> confessed to the slayings of at least 23 women in four states and gave information that linked him to other killings. Some investigators have said they believe his real total is 100 or more. In all, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> has been suspected at one time or another in killings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. He was convicted of three killings in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said Special Agent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagmaier </PERSON>, who is assigned to the center, was present at <LOCATION> Bundy </LOCATION>'s request at the interviews. <PERSON> Hagmaier </PERSON> had interviewed Bundy several times in the past as part of the center's research into serial violence, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> said Sunday that two detectives, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Couch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, were leaving for <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION> on Monday and would be there all week. Couch interviewed <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> two days before his execution, and at that time <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> `` claimed responsibility'' for eight killings in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> during the mid-1970s when he was a law student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> said. `` We linked <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> to five of them, but there was some comment that he was responsible for eight, and we're very much concerned which ones they are,'' he said. <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> said the detectives would `` mainly try to coordinate all of the information developed by other investigators to see if there's anything more that we can put into the cases we have open here.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he did not know how many law enforcement officials would be attending the conference. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION> did not return telephone calls from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Friday.

 Police investigating the murder of a young black activist detained four men at <ORGANIZATION> Winnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION>'s home Sunday and said they found traces of blood during a pre-dawn raid there. Radio reports said the men served as Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s bodyguards. `` This is a thorough search of the premises where the alleged attacks and assaults took place, according to witnesses,'' said Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Jaap </PERSON> <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON>, chief of the investigation into the death of <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>, 14. The boy's body, with the throat slit, was found last month dumped in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the sprawling black township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. South African Police released a videotape of their operation, showing officers, without gloves, searching trunks of clothing, leafing through photograph albums and collections of <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> literature, and lifting up what appeared to be blood-soaked sneakers, a knife and a pair of gardening shears. The camera focused on spots on the walls of some back rooms where the detained men lived. State-run Radio <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said the spots were spatters of blood. Three Soweto men have said Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s bodyguards abducted them and the boy and beat them at the <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> house. They say Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, wife of imprisoned <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, was involved. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 54, has denied being at home when the four were brought there. But she has defended their abduction and said they probably were `` slapped'' to get them to talk about alleged homosexual activities at the <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> residence where they lived. The church denies her allegations. `` We have found fingerprints and blood samples which will be sorted out in the laboratory,'' said <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON>. He said police will try to prove in court that members of the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> soccer team, who live at Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s home and act as her bodyguards, assaulted the boy who died. The Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference Saturday that Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> had decided to remove the young men from her home at her husband's instruction. Major anti-apartheid leaders inside <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the exiled <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> president have publicly criticized Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s association with the soccer team. <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON> said one of those detained during the 4 a.m. raid was <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, identified as team coach. Others arrested at the house were not named, but <LOCATION> Radio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said they were Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s bodyguards. <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON> said police also arrested two other men elsewhere in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, who will be charged with murdering <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>'s Dr. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Asvat </PERSON>. Community leaders have told newspapers that <PERSON> Asvat </PERSON> examined <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON> after he was beaten. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> said <PERSON> Asvat </PERSON> was a witness to her charges of sexual abuse. Police also raided five other `` premises'' connected with Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, including the home of a free-lance journalist, <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON> said. He did not identify the others. The alarm went off and dogs barked as policemen entered the back houses at Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s home, according to the film. It shows Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, her daughter, <PERSON> Zindzi </PERSON>, and grandchildren in their bathrobes. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was filmed in his underwear, putting on his pants and shirt while a policeman asked him to identify men who ran away when the raid started. State television broadcast those scenes from the film, which police made available to foreign reporters the same day. They do not usually release material so quickly. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> has promised foreign journalists he will release any information on the case as quickly as possible, which also is unusual. The film showed <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON> directing the search while Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> went about her daily chores, provided refreshments to journalists waiting on the front lawn. She was heard chatting, laughing and listening to Nat King Cole music. Police searched through Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s belongings but did not take any of them, said a journalist at the scene.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> SEATTLE </LOCATION> _ A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary may have curtailed testing of high-tech nuts and bolts destined for use in the new <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> B-2 stealth bomber in order to save money, according to a published report Sunday. The supplier of those nuts and bolts is now under investigation, suspected of supplying substandard parts stamped as approved by a fictitious `` Inspector 11.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that an internal memo declared that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> had the testing of incoming fasteners curtailed just as a federal task force began the investigation into fraud in the aerospace fastener industry. Only `` suspect'' parts would be tested, the memo stated. Among the parts that may have escaped routine testing by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> were high-tech titanium nuts and bolts manufactured by a <LOCATION> Chatsworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, company called Voi-Shan, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> uses Voi-Shan nuts and bolts. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is manufacturing classified parts for the Stealth bomber, made by the <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Two weeks ago, 20 federal agents armed with search warrants seized 52 crates of documents, test equipment and fasteners in a raid on Voi-Shan, the newspaper said The agents were searching for evidence to support allegations made by three past and present Voi-Shan workers that no testing was done on the fasteners, but the fasteners were given a stamp of approval by a fictitious `` Inspector 11.'' The Times said tests done on high-performance titanium fasteners, used to hold together everything from engines to airframes, were of particular concern. The newspaper also obtained <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Voi-Shan </ORGANIZATION> shipping documents that stated in the week before the raid, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> received two shipments of more than 200 Voi-Shan titanium fasteners, with test reports certified by `` Inspector 11.'' The Times, quoting an unidentified source, said those parts were only two of many similar shipments designated for the B-2 project last year. According to a memo obtained by the newspaper, a quality-control manager at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> ordered the routine testing of incoming shipments of some fasteners stopped, apparently to save money. The Feb. 18, 1988, memo directed at top managers of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> B-2 program stated: `` Effective immediately, routine receiving inspection testing of fasteners is to be stopped. Only those fasteners identified as suspect will be suspect to test.'' The memo said the company expected to save $ 53,000 by reducing testing from March to October last year. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> confirmed that the memo was legitimate, but declined further comment on it or any aspect of the B-2 program. The company said its own investigation into the safety of the Voi-Shan fasteners had turned up no problems, the Times said. <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Voi-Shan </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, said last Tuesday in a statement that it is investigating the charges against Voi-Shan. Fairchild said there has been no claim from customers that it shipped any unsafe fasteners and said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> resumed full-scale testing of Voi-Shan parts two weeks ago, after the Voi-Shan raid. The task force, made up of agents of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, and a grand jury in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> are looking into charges of fraudulent testing and falsified documentation of aerospace fasteners. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> stated that it is not a target of the investigation and is cooperating with the task force. It also said it has its own screening processes to test incoming parts.

 Man, it's cold in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>.

But Gazette readers did n't buy that line, as most of the 159 entries in the <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>'s contest zeroed in on the state's propensity for cold winters. There was `` Darn Dacolda,'' `` Zipdacoatup,'' `` Weardakotanhat,'' `` Saskatchacolda,'' `` Subtopia'' and, for those who put things bluntly, `` Land of the Frozen Dead.'' <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>'s first-place prize was a one-way bus ticket from Billings to <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, or the cash equivalent of $ 45.

 A dance troupe from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is back on tour again with a new schedule of appearances after being stranded for two weeks when their financial backing fell apart. The 59 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Donetsk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> and Ballet Theatre set out by bus Saturday for a Sunday night performance in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, ending an unexpected two-week stay at the Belvedere Hotel. Hotel front desk manager <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Steurnagle </PERSON>, 31, had tears in his eyes when he embraced each of the departing Ukrainian performers. `` I've been in the hotel business 10 years, and I've never been involved personally with guests before,'' <PERSON> Steurnagle </PERSON> said after they left. `` They were such good people. They brought me gifts all the time. I will miss them.'' The ballet troupe had planned a 15-city U.S. tour. But when the Soviets refused to allow three well-known dancers to join the company for its American debut performances, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Mexican investors withheld $ 200,000 in financial support, saying the three stars had been promised. That left the troupe of young, relatively unknown dancers in the lurch and cast into doubt the future of their performances in such cities as <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> benefactors scrambled to find backing for a new tour, contributors donated food, liquor and money. The Belvedere and the Lyric Opera contributed meals. The Lyric held a benefit performance. Trips were arranged to the National Aquarium and the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Figure Skating Championships in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> helped arrange a White House trip. Finally, last weekend, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> concert management firm, <ORGANIZATION> ICM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gilman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> announced the booking at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branch </LOCATION>, plus seven performances at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s City Center, to be followed by seven more performances in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

At Saturday's departure, Lyric president <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomory </PERSON> shared embraces and kisses with the dancers and several of them threw him into the air in celebration of his support. `` I'm their brother and Mr. <PERSON> Pomory </PERSON> is their father,'' <PERSON> Steurnagle </PERSON> said. `` It's like I developed a whole new entire family,'' <PERSON> Pomory </PERSON> added.

 Moderate Afghan guerrillas unhappy with nominees for an interim government for their nation on Sunday walked out of a meeting called to elect a president and prime minister. <PERSON> Qaribur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehman </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON>, a spokesman for a guerrilla-operated news agency, said the special <ORGANIZATION> Consultative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of about 400 delegates will meet again Monday despite the standoff involving the seven Afghan guerrilla groups based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Four of the seven guerrilla parties are made up of hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> fundamentalists who want to establish a strict fundamentalist state in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The three moderate groups want a more liberal state similar to the governments prior to the communist coup in 1978. Moderate factions walked out Sunday, and sources said even representatives of hard-line guerrilla groups argued against a proposed government headed by <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> as prime minister. `` <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> is a product of disunity, not unity,'' a guerrilla official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> is a senior political official of the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Ittehad-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group. `` We wo n't be part of this shameful government,'' said a spokesman for the moderate <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He also spoke on condition of anonymity. Sources who attended the council session said members of that group were among the guerrillas who walked out. The nominee for acting president of the interim government is <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammadi </PERSON>, head of the moderate Harakat-i-Inquilab-i-Islami guerrilla group. The guerrilla groups are deeply divided over sharing power, and the nominations of <PERSON> Mohammadi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> were seen as a compromise on who would lead <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> if its Soviet-back government collapses. The Soviets withdrew their last troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Wednesday and the guerrillas have vowed to overthrow the communist government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. On Saturday, <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> said a vote scheduled for Sunday on the nominations was expected to be a formality because the council delegates were in agreement. After Sunday's session, however, he said it was not clear when the vote would be held. The council also is to appoint a Cabinet. The council, which convened Feb. 10, was expected to conclude after the vote. If the guerrillas seize power, they would hold elections within six months to form an elected council, or shura, that would appoint a permanent head of state and ratify a government, officials say. Outside the meeting site, a <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> police officer shot to death a fellow officer. Police officials said the shooting was unrelated to the Afghan council session. Some witnesses said it was a vengeance killing. As the guerrilla leaders began leaving the compound where the council meeting was held, some stopped momentarily to watch as an ambulance removed the body of the slain police officer. Afghans and journalists milling outside the meeting fled for cover when the other officer opened fire. He paced nervously in front of the body for more than 30 minutes and kept plainclothes officers at bay. A superior then arrived and talked him into surrendering. He was disarmed and fell to his knees and wept.

 The 1990s will be the `` she'' generation, where women can write the scripts in their relationships with men, according to Dr. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON>. `` We've been through the ` me' generation.

But she said in the 1990s, things will change because of shifting population patterns, and there will be about 105 eligible men for every 100 eligible women. `` Women will be writing the script,'' she said. `` They will demand courting. They will demand romance. They will demand babies within marriage. They will demand marriage.'' The noted psychologist also predicted a drop in the divorce rate during the 1990s.

 The number of police has not kept pace with the crime rate in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the murder capital of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and union officials are urging the mayor to hire more officers. `` The homicide rate so far this year is terrible proof that we can not wait,'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hankins </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> labor committee, recently told Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The number of crimes reported in the city grew from 52,431 in 1986 to 61,884 last year, but the number of police remained the same, 3,958 officers. The crime rate is growing even faster this year, with 75 people murdered by last week, putting the city on a course for 600 murders, shattering the record 372 set last year. The crisis prompted Police Chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to declare a crime emergency starting Tuesday. The chief city attorney, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said the step would allow police to reassign officers without giving the 28 days notice required in an agreement with the Fraternal Order of Police. Police blame `` crack'' cocaine for the upsurge in crime, and say drugs are responsible for 60 percent of the murders this year and last. Morale on the force is at an all-time low because so many young people are being drawn into the lucrative drug trade, say union officials. `` This ca n't go on forever,'' <PERSON> Hankins </PERSON> warned. `` There's no slowdown in the drug trade, and burnout is getting to be a real problem.'' The number of police officers has dipped since the early 1970's, when there were 5,000. The number was 3,958 from 1984 through last year, rose to 4,130, this year, and was slated to increase by 200 by 1990. Police chief <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> says that the key is not adding police but intercepting drugs before they hit the street. `` You can always use more officers, but I think more officers will end up in more drug arrests,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` We have to attack the supply side because if we do n't do that, we'll get to the point where 20,000 officers wo n't be enough.'' City jails and courts are already clogged by drug arrests. Since the start of Operation Clean Sweep against drugs in August 1986, more than 45,000 people have been arrested for drug-related offenses. City prisons are so overcrowded that inmates are being sent to facilities as distant as <PERSON> Walla </PERSON> <PERSON> Walla </PERSON>, Wash. The city may have neither the money nor the means to increase the force rapidly. The 1988 budget was $ 34 million in deficit. And the number of officers eligible to retire is high, 250 annually over the next three years. `` It will take years to actually bring these -LRB- recruits -RRB- on board and for them to mature to a high level of effectiveness,'' <PERSON> Hankins </PERSON> said. `` In the meantime, we'll be losing officers.''

 The election of former <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> as a Republican to the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Legislature drew quick cries of dismay from civil rights organizations and a call for his repudiation by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> is not a Republican,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's a pretender, a charlatan and a political opportunist who is looking for any organization he can find to try to legitimize his views of racial and religious bigotry and intolerance.''

Civil rights groups reacted with similar rejection of the policies espoused by the former grand wizard of the Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s election, if verified, is a gain for the forces of racism and bigotry,'' said A.I <PERSON> Botnick </PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Defamation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` Anyone who believes he has changed also believes in the tooth fairy.'' <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellenoff </PERSON> issued a statement in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> saying: `` While there has been significant progress in recent years in containing bigotry in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, this development reminds us that there is much more work to be done.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON>, president of People for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>, a nonpartisan constitutional liberties organization, called <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s election `` a victory for the dark side of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politics _ the politics of race ...

 More than 10,000 people at a Sunday Mass in southeast <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> recalled the birth eight years ago of the banned independent farmers' union and expressed optimism it soon will operate freely again. Government and opposition negotiators agreed in principle last week to legalize Rural Solidarity. The union representing the Polish countryside was banned along with workers' Solidarity in the December 1981 martial law crackdown. Solidarity and Rural Solidarity are separate but mutually supporting organizations. `` Today we are witnessing the beginning of a process in which the truth is becoming visible again,'' Bishop <PERSON> Ignacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tokarczuk </PERSON> said in a sermon at the service marking the anniversary of the Feb. 18, 1981 agreement that legalized Rural Solidarity. `` We welcome with cautious hope the understanding that it is better to talk than to fight,'' he said. The bishop said they were witnessing the `` bankruptcy'' of a political system without God. He warned against being too trusting of authorities' promises. `` We have to talk but do not allow cheating,'' he said. `` We have the support of a united society which is pressing and demanding its rights.'' At the end of the Mass, messages of support from workers around the country were read. The huge modern church on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Rzeszow </LOCATION>, 190 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, was filled literally to the rafters, with worshipers crammed into the staircase leading to its roof. `` The moods are so radical that people demand that we prepare some kind of protest for them,'' said <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Balazs </PERSON>, a member of Rural Solidarity's national council and one of the negotiators at the current talks with the government on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future. <PERSON> Balazs </PERSON> and union chairman <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Slisz </PERSON> said they were preparing a draft of a new law about legalizing Rural Solidarity. `` We have been talking to farmers for two days here and now we are drawing our conclusions,'' said <PERSON> Slisz </PERSON>. `` It has been a good lesson for us. We will go to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and see what the effects are.'' The farmers' movement continued to function despite the ban and leaders said there has been a surge of interest in recent weeks. `` More and more farmers are joining the union and there is a great revival of the movement in the countryside,'' said <PERSON> Slisz </PERSON>. He said farmers' councils already are functioning openly in 36 of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s 49 provinces and he expects the number to grow. <PERSON> Slisz </PERSON> said farmers worried most about the low prices they receive for their produce, which he said has not kept pace with increases in the cost of seed, fertilizer, fodder and machinery.

It is n't to be a joyous celebration,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said in the couple's first interview since <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s execution Jan. 24 In a story on the interview Sunday, The Morning News Tribune of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> reported the couple also has received some 400 cards from people who were moved by the suffering of the killer's mother and stepfather. `` This is just to let you know, all people are not cruel and sadistic people. My thoughts and prayers are with you all,'' one woman wrote. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s electric chair for the 1978 murder of 12-year-old <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Some investigators believe he may have killed up to 100 people. Until her son started confessing to at least 23 murders in the days before his execution, Mrs. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said she believed he was innocent. `` When his confessions came out, it was all like a blow right between the eyes,'' she said. `` This was not the <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> we had raised _ we never saw anything to indicate it.'' <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was born in 1946, at a home for unwed mothers, and the boy was raised partly by his grandparents _ Mrs. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s parents _ during his first few years. Mrs. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> married <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> in 1951, and he then adopted young <PERSON> Ted </PERSON>. But Mrs. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said her son had a normal childhood, and discounted her son's contention during his final days that exposure to pornography kept by his grandfather had affected him. `` We did everything parents of the'50s and'60s did,'' she said, even down to reading Dr. <PERSON> Spock </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> wrote his parents a final letter on the eve of his death, saying, in part, `` Nothing I can say can ease your pain. It is a terrible thing, I know, but I have to try to make it right _ to tell the truth.'' `` I do love you. You were wonderful parents.'' The night before the execution, the <ORGANIZATION> Bundys </ORGANIZATION> remained at home until midnight, talking with <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> on the telephone and with visitors. The family went to a friend's house at midnight, and waited out the morning with about 30 friends and church members. `` Nobody had to call and tell us it was over. We knew it,'' she said. `` Along about 7:15 or so _ I guess it was 4:15 here _ I just knew that <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> was all right. I knew it was over. I felt more at peace at that moment than I had for 13 years.'' On the day he was executed, crowds of people gathered outside the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> penitentiary where they waved frying pans and shouted `` Burn, Bundy, Burn!'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> said she was angered by the comments of an investigator that her son was born to kill. `` No beautiful child is born to kill. He was not born to do that,'' she said. Her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, said he and his wife have been unable to determine why <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> became a killer. `` We talk about it and try to figure out down the line what it was. Like I say, it was something he more or less kept under cover,'' he said. `` So far as figuring out why _ it's not going to be figured out,'' said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>.

 Evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, struggling amid charges of sexual misconduct, said Sunday that his television ministry lost $ 1.5 million in January and still needs an influx of donations to stay on the air. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who declared war on `` pornographers'' he said are trying to destroy his ministry, said last week that he would be off the air after Feb. 26 unless supporters provided enough money. During his weekly TV program shown Sunday, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said followers had responded to the plea but that more donations were needed to continue the broadcast to all areas. `` On Feb. 26, if we do not continue to receive support, we will lose some stations,'' he said. Although <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> did not reveal how much money had been received, he said the ministry posted a $ 1.5 million loss in January, a month he said is traditionally the worst month for television evangelists. Last month, Penthouse magazine quoted a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> `` strip-o-gram'' dancer as saying she posed nude for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, a charge that he labeled Sunday as `` a scam, a lie from A to Z.'' <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON>'s story is similar to that of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> prostitute who said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> paid her to pose nude for him, an allegation that led to <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ouster from the Assemblies of God and a sharp downturn in the fortunes of his ministry. On Feb. 21, 1988, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> made a tearful confession to an unspecified sin from the pulpit of his <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> church. `` I am not discounting any sin or mistake that <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has committed or made,'' he said during Sunday's program. `` So, please understand that. I have stood up as possibly no man in history has ever stood up and blamed no one but myself before the whole wide world.'' `` But if Satan succeeds in getting you to zero in on that, and that's all you see, then he will succeed,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> repeated his charge that Penthouse published the story even though it had been given evidence that <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON>'s story was false. Penthouse has said it stands by the story. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s attorneys have said a libel suit is being prepared

 About 100 people gathered outside <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michael </LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Archangel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday morning, kneeling, singing and praying before the locked doors of the building that protesters had occupied for nearly a week. Diocese leaders closed the predominantly <PERSON> Polich </PERSON> church until further notice early Saturday after police removed dissident parishioners who had occupied the church to protest the transfers of a popular pastor and an assistant priest and to demand that the current pastor leave. `` The doors are locked, but we want to show the world we wo n't quit,'' said <PERSON> Halina </PERSON> <PERSON> Chmiel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Milford </LOCATION>, one of the leaders of the protest The Sunday morning rally lasted about an hour without any incident. Mrs. <PERSON> Chmiel </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, 35, and <PERSON> Franciszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojenski </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, were the only ones arrested when 40 police officers, who arrived on a school bus, marched single file to clear the church early Saturday morning. The others left voluntarily, ending the protesters' `` pray-in'' that began Feb. 11. Regular church activities continued during the protest. The police action came hours after negotiations between church authorities and the protesters ended in an emotional, shouting melee inside the church. The group rejected appeals to leave from the Rev. <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronkiewicz </PERSON>, the diocese's vicar for clergy, and a visiting Franciscan superior from <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the Very Rev. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawalski </PERSON>. The protesters also rejected an appeal from the former assistant pastor they want to return, the Rev. <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Palaszewski </PERSON>, who is being transferred back to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. He made a surprise visit to the church late Friday, his first appearance since his removal in December. No officials of the diocese were available for comment Sunday about when the church would be reopened, the diocese answering service said. The protesters charge that the current church leadership are diluting the Polish traditions of the church, which is located in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood.

 A new group calling itself the `` Black Cats'' executed 20 Sinhalese men in central villages in the first major violence since election results were announced last week, military officials said Sunday. The officials said the victims were members of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an ultranationalist Sinhalese militant group opposing the Sinhalese-dominated government's moves to grant limited autonomy to Tamils in the north and east In the north, at least four Tamils were killed and six injured in factional clashes between two groups of rebel Tamil militias, military officials said. Soldiers discovered the bodies of the 20 young Sinhalese men late Saturday, shot through the head with their arms tied behind their backs, many of them partially burned, said officials of the military joint operations command, who can not be quoted under briefing rules. The bodies were found in the villages of <LOCATION> Vijithapura </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siripura </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Anuradhapura </LOCATION> district, 105 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> in the Sinhalese heartland of central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, officials said. Notices found near the bodies claimed the killings were carried out by the `` Black Cats,'' the officials said. Officials said they had never heard of the group. The killings were the first since President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won parliamentary polls in results declared Thursday, the officials said. At least 1,000 people, including 14 candidates for the legislature, were killed during the five-week election campaign that began Jan. 6, threatened by Sinhalese and Tamil militants. Most of the deaths were blamed on the People's <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, while police blamed Tamil extremists for a few killings, mostly in the north of the island. Militant Tamils claim they are discriminated against by the mostly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> majority who make up 75 per cent of the island's population, in education, employment and culture. They have waged a secessionist war for an independent Tamil homeland since 1983, in which more than 8,500 people, mostly Sinhalese civilians, have been killed. Also Saturday, four members of a former Tamil guerrilla organization, the <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> of Students were killed in fights between them and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> Six others were injured, military officials said. The clashes took place in <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION> in the north and <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, but details were not immediately available, the officials said. Mostly Hindu Tamils comprise 18 per cent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and are in a slight majority in northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Sinhalese militants also have unleashed a bloody campaign against the government for making too many concessions to minority Tamils. More than 1,500 people, mostly Sinhalese government supporters, have fallen victim to the Sinhalese militant backlash since July 1987.

<HEAD>Report: Tests Show Once-Promising AIDS Drug Is Apparently Ineffective</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Research shows a once-promising AIDS drug that has become a popular underground treatment is unlikely to be effective against the killer disease, according to a report published Sunday. Oral dextran, believed to be used by thousands of people infected with the AIDS virus, does not appear to be significantly absorbed into the bloodstream, apparently rendering it ineffective, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. The preliminary results of government-sponsored studies on humans and animals have been known to researchers for more than a month without a public announcement, Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, told the Times. He said the decision to remain quiet reflected the preliminary nature of the data and his fears that an announcement could dash the hopes of people with AIDS taking the drug. The Japanese-manufactured drug had been considered a promising experimental therapy after studies showed the compound could prevent the AIDS virus from infecting immune system cells in test tubes and interfere with the virus' ability to kill the cells. But <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said early findings that the drug is not significantly absorbed into the bloodstream suggest oral dextran `` does not have the promise of effectiveness that a lot of people thought and that we hoped prior to having this information.'' Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoth </PERSON>, director of the AIDS Program at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases, cautioned that the results are preliminary and that it is `` theoretically possible'' for the compound to be absorbed over time. Officials at the institute and university researchers are hoping to better answer questions about oral dextran based on data now being reviewed from a six-month, 60-patient study of the drug. `` I do n't think there is any great mystery about why there has been no announcement,'' <PERSON> Hoth </PERSON> said. `` We are dealing with scientific complexity, and we want to make sure that everything is pulled together before making a strong public statement.'' AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, attacks the body's ability to fight off disease and infection There is no known cure, but therapies using the drug AZT appear to prolong the lives of some AIDS patients. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said he `` felt compelled to answer honestly'' questions about the effectiveness of oral dextran as another treatment. In the meantime, he strongly warned people against injecting the drug directly into their bloodstream, saying the practice `` could be very, very harmful.'' Dextran, a potent blood thinner, can cause bleeding, infections or severe allergic reactions when it is injected. Previous data has suggested oral dextran taken by mouth does not have harmful effects. Oral dextran, an inexpensive drug manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Ueno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, has been sold in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for many years as a treatment for atherosclerosis, or fatty collections in the arteries. The drug has been imported over the last two years by `` buyers' clubs'' organized by people infected with the AIDS virus The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has allowed AIDS patients to legally import small quantities of unapproved medicines for personal use against AIDS and other diseases.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Opposed To One Proposed Spaceport Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Environmentalists across the country will fight attempts to build the nation's first commercial spaceport at a site on the northern part of Kennedy Space Center, a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> activist warns. `` This is one of those fall-on-your-sword-and-die issues,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, senior vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The state hopes to build a $ 58 million <LOCATION> Spaceport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> within three years at either Kennedy Space Center or the adjacent Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. But more than a dozen environmentalist and civic groups plan to oppose any attempt to locate the spaceport on a part of the space center known as <ORGANIZATION> Shiloh </ORGANIZATION> that is managed as a park by the <ORGANIZATION> Merritt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the Shiloh site remains, you will probably see opposition to <LOCATION> Spaceport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on a nationwide level,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. Building at <LOCATION> Shiloh </LOCATION> would increase construction costs by 20 percent, but state officials prefer it because they want to avoid restrictions on funding and access posed by using a military installation, according to <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Shove </PERSON>, director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>'s space programs office. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said letting public officials give chunks of parkland for commercial ventures would set a bad precedent. The launch facility also would restrict public access to the wildlife refuge and <ORGANIZATION> Canaveral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seashore </ORGANIZATION>, and highly toxic rocket fuels would endanger nearby environmentally sensitive areas, critics of the proposal say. `` We all support putting it at <ORGANIZATION> Canaveral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Volusia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> environmentalist. `` Perhaps it would be best to eliminate the controversy now and drop the Shiloh site.'' State officials met with environmental and civic groups Friday in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> to answer questions, and more meetings will be held. `` If significant environmental impact is shown at <LOCATION> Shiloh </LOCATION>, the project will be stopped,'' Shove said. `` But I do n't think there's been any evidence of that yet. Under the <ORGANIZATION> Shiloh </ORGANIZATION> plan, the state initially would build one launch pad on a 50-acre area. As demand increased for commercial launches, three more pads could be added, he said. At the Canaveral base, three launch pads abandoned by the military could be used after extensive renovations. State officials expect to pick the final site within six months and start a detailed environmental study of both areas shortly after, Shove said. But if the Legislature refuses Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s request for the first $ 10 million for the project this spring, <LOCATION> Spaceport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> may be shelved.

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met Sunday with King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and said he hopes to persuade <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials this week to abandon their `` stubborn'' stand against the Arabs. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> offered new proposals for advancing the peace process Saturday in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the first stop on his 10-day Middle East tour. He left <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> on Sunday night after a 7 -LCB- - hour stay and told reporters that he would meet both Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> He is also to visit <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> before returning home Feb. 27 from a trip that is pushing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> closer to the heart of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told reporters before his talks with <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> that he was giving the king a letter from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that touched on `` the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> issue and the peaceful march to solve this question.''

Restoration of relations is an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> condition for a Soviet role in peace talks and the two nations recently began consular contacts. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday that the meeting with <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> would be a `` positive phenomenon.''

 Troops wounded 11 Arabs during sporadic clashes on Sunday, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said, and Palestinians in the occupied lands shut down businesses to begin a three-day strike to press for an independent homeland. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, shrieks, scuffles and a cry of `` Death to all terrorists!'' disrupted the funeral of <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a 21-year-old soldier who was stabbed to death Saturday as he walked unarmed near <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cohen </ORGANIZATION>'s death and the suspected kidnapping of another <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier, Sgt. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasportaz </PERSON>, who has been missing for three days. `` The two incidents, it is not possible that they were not organized by a group and I believe that it was connected to a terror group,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` Read that as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` I recommend to those overseas, who cling to the foot of -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is terror,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has not rejected terror, both in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and outside.'' Thousands of soldiers, police and civilian volunteers continued the search for <LOCATION> Sasportaz </LOCATION> on Sunday, and his mother <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> issued an impassioned plea on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, begging the kidnappers to `` Please give me him alive, do n't kill him.'' The three-day general strike to demand an independent Palestine is the longest work stoppage called by pro-PLO underground leaders since Palestinians began their 14-month-old revolt against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> Arab news reports said the first strike day was fully observed. But <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said some <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> workers showed up for jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Soldiers trying to prevent stoning attacks Sunday clamped curfews on three neighborhoods and refugee camps in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, confining 45,000 Palestinians to their homes, and sealed off 13 alleys in the Khan Yunis refugee camp. Sporadic protests erupted, however, and troops were stoned and responded with gunfire in at least three incidents, wounding eleven people, according to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports. The army confirmed five of the wounded and said it was investigating the other incidents. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, 1,000 mourners held an emotional military funeral for <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, who was on leave and in civilian clothes when he was attacked. `` We see that the people of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and their supporters speak with knives,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told mourners. No Palestinian group has claimed responsibility for the killing. `` Jewish blood can not be spilled without being avenged!'' shouted one man, among a few people who disrupted the service for about 10 minutes. Other mourners tried to calm down protesters, who finally were removed by police. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a former seminary student, was the 16th Israeli killed since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987. At least 383 Palestinians have been killed in that time. In another development: _ <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said an 18-year-old Palestinian jailed for security offenses was found stabbed to death in <LOCATION> Beersheba </LOCATION> prison in southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Police believe he was killed by another Arab inmate for as yet unknown reasons, the radio said. _ <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ordered prominent <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> journalist <PERSON> Samaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khouri </PERSON> detained for six months without trial after he participated in recent meetings with left-wing Israelis <PERSON> Khouri </PERSON> works part-time for <ORGANIZATION> Agence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION> news agency and was detained for 4 -LCB- months as a suspected <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> activist last year.

 A real-estate developer who recently purchased one of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>'s famed mansions has riled some of his neighbors by building a fence along the popular Cliff Walk. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Mele </PERSON>, who paid $ 2 million for the mansion once owned by novelist <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Wharton </PERSON>, said he decided to build the fence because hikers on the Cliff Walk were crossing his property and leaving litter behind.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> is being so secretive about its uranium processing plant in nearby <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON> that federal investigations and cleanup efforts have been hampered, a newspaper reported Sunday. Investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and staffs of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members have complained of heavy secrecy by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` The problem with these people -LRB- at the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- ... is that they think <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> is still president and the Cold War is still going on,'' the newspaper quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> staff member as saying. The newspaper cited several examples of difficulties investigators claim to have encountered. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told federal and state <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> investigators that documents they requested can not be obtained, but then provided copies of those documents to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> lawyers suing the plant's former operator, <ORGANIZATION> NLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, for $ 300 `` I've never seen a situation like this,'' said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON>, lead attorney in the suit on behalf of people who live and work within a five-mile radius of the plant. `` I assumed, naively, that every governmental agency cooperates with every other governmental agency. They're so used to hiding behind clouds of secrecy that they ca n't seem to come into the'80s and get the problems resolved.'' _ Rep <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, an outspoken critic of <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON>, was told by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that the federal <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> had withdrawn its inspectors from the plant before telling the company now under contract to operate the plant, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, that it had done so. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed court papers last fall saying it had ignored and underfunded pollution control at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION> but did not tell <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> Company spokesmen learned of the controversial filing, which provoked widespread outrage and a congressional hearing, in conversation with a reporter, the Enquirer reported. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>, which is supervising cleanup, said it finds its credibility dented when it is asked to comment on revelations it has not heard about. The Energy Department denies secrecy over the plant is a problem. `` In an organization as big as <PERSON> DOE </PERSON>, there's always an opportunity to improve communications, but there's nothing deliberate going on,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> at the agency's <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, operations office, which oversees <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON>. Critics say the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s resistance to sharing information ranges from embarrassing to dangerous. Cleanup can not start until the agencies accurately account for radioactive and chemical waste at the plant. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> is awaiting a complete accounting of radioactive emissions from the plant during its 38-year history so it can begin its study of possible health effects on workers and neighbors of the plant.

 A tawny eagle on display took an unscheduled flight Sunday as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> returned for his second polo match during a weekend visit to benefit an animal conservation group.

 Authorities arrested two people on charges they tried to give top-secret <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> documents to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, including information on a new computer system that can direct an entire battle, news reports said Sunday. The arrests broke one and perhaps two <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> operations, the reports said. `` It could be the biggest counter-espionage operation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in recent years,'' said <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s La Repubblica. Prosecutors and police confirmed two people were arrested for espionage, but refused to give details, saying the investigation was continuing. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> AGI </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday the arrests ended two separate <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> operations in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The reports about the affair, carried by newspapers and the state-run <ORGANIZATION> RAI </ORGANIZATION> television, identified those arrested as <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Stancich </PERSON>, an electronics technician living in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Natalino </PERSON> <PERSON> Francalanci </PERSON>, a fur dealer from <LOCATION> Pontedera </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Francalanci </PERSON>, 51, was arrested Feb. 11 in the <LOCATION> Ligurian </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spezia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stancich </PERSON>, 42, was arrested Thursday near the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Trieste </LOCATION>, the reports said. Newspapers said <PERSON> Francalanci </PERSON> traveled often to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on business. <PERSON> RAI </PERSON> said his arrest was in connection with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> research on anti-submarine warfare. <ORGANIZATION> AGI </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Francalanci </PERSON> was linked to an alleged Soviet effort to procure information about the making of fiber optics for industry and the military. <PERSON> Stancich </PERSON> worked for IRET, a joint Italian-Yugoslavian firm in <LOCATION> Trieste </LOCATION> that manufactures electronic communications systems for civilian and military use, the reports said. He commuted to work from <LOCATION> Skofje </LOCATION>, just across the border in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> where he lives. The reports said <PERSON> Stancich </PERSON> was arrested while trying to cross the border with documents related to a highly advanced electronic warfare project known as <PERSON> Catrin </PERSON>, said to be one of the most sophisticated systems of its kind and destined for use by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. The project, still under development, involves computer systems capable of directing activity on an entire battefield, including ground and air operations, the reports said. <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Corriere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Della </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION> reported that the operation was coordinated across the Yugoslav border by <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents apparently working without the knowledge of the Yugoslav government. The newspaper quoted unidentified sources as identifying one agent as a former <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency correspondent in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. RAI said the classified information was to have been sent from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AGI </ORGANIZATION> said that in the other operation, the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> was seeking to obtain information on the technology used by <PERSON> Otomelara </PERSON>, a La Spezia firm that makes fiber optics. It said Italian agents, posing as suppliers of information, discovered that two Italians had been bringing information about the technology to the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AGI </ORGANIZATION> said the two Italians were <PERSON> Francalanci </PERSON> and another man who had escaped to another, unidentified country.

<HEAD>Attorneys Say About 200 Fasting in Natal Province</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURBAN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 200 black prisoners in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province are refusing to eat until they receive the same sort of attention that authorities gave another group of fasting inmates, lawyers said Sunday. The <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province prisoners have been on a hunger strike since last week and their attorneys say they are trying to arrange a meeting with Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> last week met with another group of civil rights lawyers representing about 200 other hunger strikers in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> provinces. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> agreed to free a number of detainees in the next two weeks. Both groups, whose members are being held without charges under state of emergency regulations, began hunger strikes to demand that they either be freed or charged. But lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> province hunger strikes, in a statement, said they are unsure whether <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>'s promise applies to their group. The attorneys said about 200 detainees are on a hunger strike in the <LOCATION> Westville </LOCATION> prison in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, the prison at <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION>, and in police cells throughout the province. A total of about 300 prisoners initially went on a hunger strike three weeks ago to protest their jailing. Some subsequently ended their strike and others joined it. They are represented by two groups of lawyers, and it was difficult to determine how many remain on a hunger strike. More than 20 hunger strikers have been hospitalized, prompting <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> to hold meetings last week with lawyers, clergymen and relatives of about 200 detainees. For the first time he received information other than that supplied by his policemen on why certain people were considered a danger to the community. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said Saturday that in the future he would assign a senior police officer to investigate factors such as family circumstances, the detainee's attitudes and his job possibilities so that those things can be considered in deciding whether a detainee should be freed. Monitoring groups have said more than 30,000 people, mostly black, have been detained for some period of time during the state of emergency, which permits indefinite incarceration without charges or trial. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> has never given a total figure, but the periodic reports he must make to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> have added up to approximately 30,000. He said two weeks ago that there were fewer than 1,000 people in detention at that time. The national state of emergency was declared on June 12, 1986, and some of the hunger strikers have been held without charge since then.

In his message Sunday, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> also called on non-Moslems to help carry out the death sentence against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. `` If a non-Moslem becomes aware of his whereabouts and has the ability to execute him quicker than a Moslem, it is incumbent on Moslems to pay a reward or a fee in return for this action,'' the statement said. Neither <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s statement nor <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> referred to the president's offer of a reprieve, reflecting a widening rift in the Iranian hierarchy over the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said: ` We heard of this report with great concern. We shall be considering carefully its implications. `` This subject will, of course, be discussed in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'' on Monday, when Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> is to raise the issue, the spokesman said. He spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with British practice. The 41-year-old <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, born to a Moslem family in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, has not been seen in public since Thursday, two days after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s first decree In his apology issued through an agent, <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> said: `` As author of ` The Satanic Verses' I recognize that Moslems in many parts of the world are genuinely distressed by the publication of my novel. I profoundly regret the distress that publication has occasioned to sincere followers of Islam.'' Moslems say `` The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes their religion by portraying the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives as prostitutes and suggesting that he wrote the Koran, the holy book of Islam, rather than receiving it directly from God. `` The Satanic Verses'' is banned in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Publishers in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> have decided not to publish the book, and some bookstore chains in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have pulled it from their shelves. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Sunday, a spokesman said Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> criticized both `` The Satanic Verses'' and those who threaten its author, and implied Catholics should avoid reading the novel. `` He -LRB- O'Connor -RRB- encourages everyone not to dignify the publication of this work, which has been viewed by Moslems as highly sacrilegious and offensive,'' said Msgr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, a spokesman for the cardinal. In <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the government decided to allow entry of the book after a review determined it was not `` hate propaganda'' as defined by Canadian law, National Revenue Minister <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Jelinek </PERSON> announced. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> had blocked imports of the book after receiving a complaint from a Moslem group. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Associations Sunday called <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s order an `` act of terrorism against freedom of conscience, of religion and of opinion, values which are held to be the truest expression of a civil and more human world.'' Representatives of the group, in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for a three-day meeting, sent a telegram to the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and to the Holy See. In <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, the leading <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily began printing excerpts of `` The Satanic Verses'' in its early Monday edition. The printing of the excerpts in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION> coincides with the arrival Monday of <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> on a three-day visit to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, the Iranian president's first official trip to a European country.

 <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s top Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> religious leaders arrived in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> on Sunday for talks aimed at ending the 14-year-old Lebanese civil war and avoiding permanent partition of the country. The talks, to begin Monday, were organized by the seven-member <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee charged with seeking a settlement of the political crisis that has left <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> without a president for the past 147 days. The leaders arriving from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Sunday were Maronite Catholic Partriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>, Greek Catholic Patriarch <PERSON> Maximos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, Sunni Moslem Grand Mufti <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, the acting chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamseddin </PERSON>; and the supreme religious judge of the Druse community, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mursel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasr </PERSON>. The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of <PERSON> Antioch </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignatius </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazim </PERSON>, spiritual leader of an estimated 300,000 Lebanese, flew from his home in the Syrian capital, <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. They were met by Kuwaiti Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> panel. Also on the panel are the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and the league's Secretary-General <PERSON> Chedli </PERSON> <PERSON> Klibi </PERSON>. Before his departure, Patriarch <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON> appealed to <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militia leader <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> to avoid a recurrence of the clash between their forces last week that shook <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian heartland. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> are both Maronites. Police said 76 people were killed and 200 wounded during two days of fierce fighting between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 Christian regular soldiers and the 6,000 iregulars of <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>'s Lebanese Forces militia, the Christians' main force in the civil war with Moslems. The first stage of the talks was held in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> last month, when the committee probed the crisis separately with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government, and with his Sunni rival, Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. The two governments emerged when President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> prime minister of a caretaker military cabinet on Sept. 22, minutes before his 6-year term ended. Parliament was unable to convene to elect a successor. Moslems rejected <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s appointment, contending it violated an unwritten national covenant dating to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. This covenant gave the premiership to the Sunnis, the paliamentary speakership to the Shiites and the presidency to the Maronites. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has been divided into Moslem and Christian de facto cantons since the 1975 outbreak of the civil war that has claimed more than 130,000 lives. Each enclave has been rocked by internal power struggles. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who makes no secret of his hopes to become <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s next president, is pressing for an unconditional withdrawal of <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>'s militias from Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and all its suburbs as a precondition for peace <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> says he will withdraw if he gets guarantees that the Syrian army and the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> will withdraw from west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

 Relatives of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 victims organized a committee Sunday to push for a congressional investigation of the flight's bombing and to step up airline security. `` If we do n't organize ourselves in an effective way ... it will be very difficult to go forward,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, an attorney and former counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Compensation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> who started the network. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Melina </PERSON>, 16, was aboard the jetliner when it blew up over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, on Dec. 21, killing all 259 aboard, including 35 students enrolled in a <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> program, and 11 residents of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. `` We've come to assist each other in our grief,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. `` We've come to try to insure that there are no more Flight 103 disasters for the air and families.'' Seventy-five to 100 relatives, many with photographs of their lost loved ones pinned to their chests, attended the meeting at a restaurant to form the <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 committee. Last week, officials announced that the terrorist's bomb which destroyed the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 was traced to a portable radio stored among the luggage. The plane was en route from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Besides giving support and aid to grieving relatives, the committee will push for a congressional investigation of the bombing, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON>, whose brother, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, was aboard Flight 103. Some committee members already have met with their local lawmakers, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sens. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, D-N. Airline security procedures have not improved enough since the explosion, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. `` It is far less than what is required to give confidence in the security of the system,'' he said. The group will campaign for stronger security measures, including installation of devices that detect plastic explosives. The families approved a resolution that calls for the resignation of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism. The group said <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> should resign because he has said airplane flight crews and passengers do not need to know about all bomb threats. <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said earlier this month that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will make sure any airline travel warning issued to government employees about terrorist threats will also go to the general public. He told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> the American embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> violated policy in posting a warning about Pan American flights from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The warning, which was not made public, came eight days before Flight 103 was bombed. `` It is not our policy to alert government officials and not the general public to such a threat,'' <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said at the time. `` There is, and can be, no double standard.'' But <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said the threats should not be announced at all, because it would encourage `` copy-cat terrorist threats.'' The Victims of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 committee want major international airlines to make public their policies regarding bomb threats.

 Rescue operations were stepped up Sunday in a jungle-covered region in northern <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> where flooding has killed at least 40 people, officials said. The National Civil Defense office in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> said Prime Minister <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON> toured the flooded zone Sunday and reported afterwards that 40 people had been killed and 30 others were missing. Officials said a layer of mud deposited by the receeding waters could conceal other victims. The rain-swollen Gera and Indoche rivers jumped their banks Friday and flooded a dozen small villages and settlements near <LOCATION> Moyobamba </LOCATION>, 450 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, city officials said. Hundreds of farm families near <LOCATION> Shucyacu </LOCATION>, a tiny village 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Moyobamba </LOCATION> were temporarily been driven from their homes, which were damaged or destroyed by the flood waters, <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said. Several <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> newspapers on Sunday gave death toll figures of up to 60, but <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> authorities, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined to confirm the newspaper numbers. The army base in <LOCATION> Tarapoto </LOCATION>, 55 miles south of the flooded zone, said more than 30 people had been killed. The inundated region, cut by dozens of small rivers and streams which swell during the current rainy season, is on the jungle-covered slopes of the eastern <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. The village of <LOCATION> Shucyacu </LOCATION> was hardest hit, <LOCATION> Moyobamba </LOCATION> officials said. The leading edge of the flood waters, which carried mud, tree trunks and other debris, swept away at least 50 of the hamlets small wooden homes with thatched roofs. Officials said about 6,000 people, mainly from farm families, live in the flooded region, but it is still unknown how many have suffered damage or loss. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Comercio </PERSON> said 35 people were missing and the flooding destroyed about 200 homes. The newspaper said the army had sent earth-moving equipment to help clear away mud left by the flood waters. <LOCATION> Moyobamba </LOCATION> city councilman <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> said the area's most important crops of rice and corn were destroyed. Officials said rescue operations were stepped up Sunday after being slowed a day earlier by stormy weather, bad roads and the flood waters. The flooding was sparked by heavy runoff from recent torrential rains in the high <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and in the foothills surrounding <LOCATION> Moyobamba </LOCATION>, authorities said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said Sunday that a delay in finding a settlement to the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict may delay withdrawal of his troops from the country. `` The best is a political solution, but we must prepare for the worst ... If others do n't want an early solution, then we must be prepared for the worst,'' <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> told a news conference at the second round of multilateral peace talks. He repeated earlier promises that <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> would pull out its forces by September if a political settlement can be reached by <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s warring factions Otherwise, the withdrawal could be delayed until December 1990, he said. Since 1970, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has suffered through a five-year war, a reign of terror by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from 1975 to 1978, the Vietnamese invasion on Christmas Day 1978, and a continuing guerrilla war. Millions have died in the land also known as <LOCATION> Kampuchea </LOCATION>. After years of deadlock, the warring parties and their neighbors met informally in July in the first tentative step toward peace. The three-day gathering that opened Sunday is the second attempt to end the Vietnamese occupation and push the tenuous negotiations toward an international conference on the country's future. The key players in the negotiations are <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the government it set up in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> in early 1979, and a three-faction resistance coalition. Also attending the talks are reprsentatives from <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> arranged the talks as <ORGANIZATION> Asean </ORGANIZATION>'s go-between with its communist neighbors. <PERSON> Thach </PERSON>'s remarks and a speech by Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government appeared designed to put early pressure on the resistance coalition and their allies. `` The position of the two Kampuchean parties are still quite far apart,'' <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said in prepared remarks. `` Postponement would only delay the Vietnamese armed forces' withdrawal and the supply of military aid as well as to only prolong the foreign interference into the <LOCATION> Kampuchean </LOCATION> conflict,'' he said The resistance coalition includes the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, by far the strongest militarily; anti-communists led by former Prime Minister <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>, and followers of former head of state Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who heads the coalition, boycotted the <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> meeting because <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> rejected his plans for peace. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s own peace plan has been rejected by the other side. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s son, Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranaridh </PERSON>, told the news conference he was representing his father and would also function as spokesman for the coalition. Sunday's opening consisted mostly of formalities and a dinner. Mutual consultations were planned Monday morning with a plenary session in the afternoon.

 A strong earthquake hit the capital and much of northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on Sunday, killing one person and injuring another, shaking buildings and briefly halting some train and airline service, officials said. The quake, registering 5.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, hit at 9:27 p.m. -LRB- 7:37 a.m. EST -RRB-, said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The agency placed the epicenter about 36 miles underground near <LOCATION> Utsunomiya </LOCATION>, 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The quake also shook all of northern <LOCATION> Honshu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s main island, a stretch about 360 miles long, but it caused no tidal waves, the spokesman said. A local fire department official said Monday that <PERSON> Shigeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohikawa </PERSON>, 78, was taken to a hospital in <LOCATION> Matsudo </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> after suffering shock. He later died of a heart attack, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. A 61-year-old man also was injured after he was hit on the head by a falling vase at his home in <LOCATION> Ibaraki </LOCATION>, 63 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official said. The man was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. About 300 households in <LOCATION> Chiba </LOCATION> state east of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> were forced to go without electricity for about 70 minutes after a power supply line was cut in the wake of the tremor, the police official said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Railways officials said trains in northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were halted for about five minutes, while local train service near <LOCATION> Utsunomiya </LOCATION> was still suspended 90 minutes after the temblor. Officials at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION>, 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said they had closed the main runway to check for damage, but after 13 minutes the runway was reopened. Subway trains in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> also were stopped temporarily, including a two-minute shutdown of the Hibiya Line, which runs under downtown areas. `` We checked to see if there was any damage,'' said an official less than one hour after the quake, `` but everything was all right and the trains are running fine.'' In central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the quake rattled plate glass windows for about a half minute, shook clocks on the wall and made chairs wobble. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is in a very active seismological area and has suffered several major earthquakes in the past. The biggest this century was in 1923, when about 140,000 <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and its neighboring <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> residents died in a quake and fires. The Richter scale, devised in 1935, is open-ended, with each digit representing a ten-fold increase in magnitude. Thus a 6.6 reading is ten times greater than a 5.6. On the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, 5.0 can cause considerable damage, while a 6.0 can mean severe damage in populated areas.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday urged guerrilla leaders and politicans to reach an accord this week that will bring peace in the country. Guerrilla leaders and representatives of all major <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> political parties are to meet in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on Monday to discuss a rebel demand that the March 19 elections be delayed until September. The rebels say they will recognize the legitimacy of the next elected government if the balloting were delayed, and if safeguards against fraud were in place. Monsignor <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, auxiliary archbishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said the date of elections `` is one of the points of the -LRB- guerrilla -RRB- proposal most easily resolved. `` Our emphasis is this: how, by changing the date of elections, do we achieve a complete guarantee that the war will end in by September? If that can be achieved, I think that not only some parties, but the immense majority would say ` Of course, we'll change the date of elections.''' The rebels have boycotted and condemned as sham the previous elections this decade. The government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> and the armed forces have all but ruled out acceptance of the guerrilla propsosal. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, presidential candidate of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convergence </ORGANIZATION> and a participant in Monday's meeting, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday he did not expect much to come of the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> talks. A breakthrough would depend on unanimous acceptance of postponement by the political parties. The rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, which is favored to win in March, has opposed postponement. An estimated 70,000 people have been killed in the 9-year-old civil war between the leftist guerrillas and the U.S.-backed government.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary may have curtailed testing of high-tech nuts and bolts destined for use in the new <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> B-2 stealth bomber in order to save money, according to a published report Sunday. The supplier of those nuts and bolts is now under investigation, suspected of supplying substandard parts stamped as approved by a fictitious `` Inspector 11.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that an internal memo declared that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> had the testing of incoming fasteners curtailed just as a federal task force began the investigation into fraud in the aerospace fastener industry. Only `` suspect'' parts would be tested, the memo stated. Among the parts that may have escaped routine testing by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> were high-tech titanium nuts and bolts manufactured by a <LOCATION> Chatsworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, company called Voi-Shan, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> uses Voi-Shan nuts and bolts. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is manufacturing classified parts for the Stealth bomber, made by the <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Two weeks ago, 20 federal agents seized 52 crates of documents, test equipment and fasteners in a raid on Voi-Shan, the newspaper said The agents were searching for evidence to support allegations made by three past and present Voi-Shan workers that no testing was done on the fasteners, but the fasteners were given a stamp of approval by a fictitious `` Inspector 11.'' The Times said tests done on high-performance titanium fasteners, used to hold together everything from engines to airframes, were of particular concern. The newspaper also obtained <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Voi-Shan </ORGANIZATION> shipping documents that stated in the week before the raid, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> received two shipments of more than 200 Voi-Shan titanium fasteners, with test reports certified by `` Inspector 11.'' The Times, quoting an unidentified source, said those parts were only two of many similar shipments designated for the B-2 project last year. According to a memo obtained by the newspaper, a quality-control manager at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> ordered the routine testing of incoming shipments of some fasteners stopped, apparently to save money. The Feb. 18, 1988, memo directed at top managers of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> B-2 program stated: `` Effective immediately, routine receiving inspection testing of fasteners is to be stopped. Only those fasteners identified as suspect will be subject to test.'' The memo said the company expected to save $ 53,000 by reducing testing from March to October last year. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> confirmed that the memo was legitimate, but declined further comment on it or any aspect of the B-2 program. The company said its own investigation into the safety of the Voi-Shan fasteners had turned up no problems, the Times said. <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Voi-Shan </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, said last Tuesday in a statement that it is investigating the charges against Voi-Shan. Fairchild said there has been no claim from customers that it shipped any unsafe fasteners and said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> resumed full-scale testing of Voi-Shan parts two weeks ago, after the Voi-Shan raid. The task force, made up of agents of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, and a grand jury in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> are looking into charges of fraudulent testing and falsified documentation of aerospace fasteners. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> stated that it is not a target of the investigation and is cooperating with the task force. It also said it has its own screening processes to test incoming parts.

<TEXT>
 The only candidate to replace Premier <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> as leader of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s most powerful party said Sunday he would not try to bring down the government. <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Forlani </PERSON> is expected to be named secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> during its five-day special congress, which began Saturday. His nomination was seen as a major defeat for <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, who considers <PERSON> Forlani </PERSON> too conservative to back his programs in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and a threat to <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>'s 10-month-old coalition government. <PERSON> Forlani </PERSON> indicated Sunday that <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> would have to heed the wishes of a new leadership. In a 1 -LCB- - hour speech to party delegates, <PERSON> Forlani </PERSON> called for support for the government, which he said had lacked steady backing as it tried to cut the huge public deficit `` The government's existence will never be threatened by maneuvers in the -LRB- party -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Forlani </PERSON> said. `` But it is on -LRB- the issue of -RRB- an economic cure that the future of the government and of the alliance -LRB- of governing parties -RRB- rides,'' he warned. The party secretary is seen by many as the most influential politician in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, since the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have dominated every government for four decades. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>'s candidates for secretary were defeated in party wrangling prior to the congress. Nonetheless, the premier tried to ensure support for his programs by asking congress Saturday to give his leadership a vote of confidence. In his speech at a sports stadium in a neighborhood built by dictator <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>, <PERSON> Forlani </PERSON> called for party unity and indicated the government would receive continued support if it stuck by the wishes of the party. `` If we -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- proceed united, the government also will be at an advantage and can reinforce its actions,'' <PERSON> Forlani </PERSON> said. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, 61, from the party's left wing, insisted on remaining party secretary when he became premier last April, saying it provided the government with stability. But many people that too much power was concentrated in <LOCATION> De </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mita </LOCATION>'s hands. <PERSON> Forlani </PERSON>, 64, who was premier in 1980-81, went into the congress with the support of the party's center faction, believed to control about one-third of the 1,312 delegates. He also had the backing of the about 20 percent of the delegates loyal to Foreign Minister <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Forlani </PERSON>'s speech, leaders of the party's left wing said they would not block his candidacy. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> was expected to be named party president, a largely ceremonial post. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have been increasing their vote total in recent years after nearly being overtaken by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1980s. One <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> adviser, former Sen. <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Onofrio </PERSON>, admitted that <PERSON> Forlani </PERSON>'s nomination marked a defeat for the premier. But he noted `` the positive result of having obliged the new majority to approve <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>'s political line with a formal motion.''

 Seven barges carrying gasoline broke free from a towboat Sunday on the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and spilled an estimated 40,000 gallons of fuel into the river after striking a railroad bridge piling, officials said. Recovery of the gasoline was impossible because it had diluted, said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, assistant chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Response </ORGANIZATION>. `` No impact has been observed thus far,'' he said. All other downstream communities close enough to be affected draw their water from wells or underground aquifers, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. The river's speedy flow makes the spill unlikely to have much effect on water supplies or aquatic life, he said. The rain-swollen <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> crested Saturday at 52.2 feet, inches above flood stage, and was falling Sunday. The spill posed the most immediate threat to the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, water system about 100 miles downstream. Gasoline tends to float on the water's surface, and authorities said water systems served by the river could close their intakes until the gasoline floats past. The spill occurred downstream from the intakes of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>'s water system, officials said. The barges, containing leaded and unleaded gasoline, were being pushed down river by the towboat <ORGANIZATION> MV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Super </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> from an <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> refinery at <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, to an Ashland products terminal on the river in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrum </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said two of the barges were leaking. Officials at the scene said several other towboats helped recapture the loose barges. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said the leaking barges were being drained of their remaining gasoline Sunday night at the Ashland facility and at a <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> facility in nearby <LOCATION> Bromley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. Recovery of the gasoline was impossible because it had been diluted, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. The incident occurred about 9:45 a.m. and river traffic was flowing normally by afternoon, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Polk </PERSON> said. The railway bridge, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, was inspected and was apparently not damaged, said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Nugent </PERSON>, terminal trainmaster for <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> & amp; Southern. The bridge is at <LOCATION> Ludlow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, within view of downtown <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> storage tank near <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, ruptured Jan. 2, 1988, and spilled about 1 million gallons of fuel that caused water-supply problems along the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.

 The Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> likely will conduct its own investigation of the 1985 crash in <LOCATION> Gander </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, of a plane carrying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen, a newspaper reported. The report follows calls to reopen a probe that ended in December with Canadian investigators divided over what caused the crash that killed 248 soldiers and a crew of eight. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, deputy leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday his party wants the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to conduct an inquiry into the crash, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s worst aviation disaster. `` There are so many lingering doubts and questions that something more has to be done,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Ottawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> as saying late last week. The Arrow Air charter DC-8, carrying soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division back to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, from peacekeeping duties in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, crashed shortly after takeoff from Gander airport on Dec. 12, 1985.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> ordered all monetary exchange operations suspended for a day Monday, when new exchange measures to encourage exports and fight inflation were to be announced. The Sunday night order affected only exchange operations, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said. Banks were expected to open as usual. The suspension `` is aimed at facilitating announcement of modifications that will be made in the exchange market,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> communique said. The modifications `` will be announced tomorrow -LRB- Monday -RRB-,'' the bank said. `` Their objective is to increase activity on the free market and provide increased incentive to exports, at the same time minimizing the impact of inflation.'' The communique did not elaborate. The bank said there will be no changes in exchange rates involving imports or for any commercial and special exchange rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> communique followed a series of closed-door meetings by President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s economic team, headed by Economy Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sourrouille </PERSON>. In recent months the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> spent more than $ 1.3 billion trying to hold down the dollar as a way to control inflation. Bank officials disclosed on Feb. 5 that they would discontinue that policy and ordered private banks and exchange houses closed Feb. 6. A three-tier system of exchange rates, including `` official, special and free'' rates, was announced Feb. 7. On Feb. 7, the dollar sold for 27 australs on the free market. At the close of business the previous Friday, it sold for 17.70 australs. The fluctuations continued last week. At the close of business on Friday, the dollar sold for 26.50. The problem, as usual, was inflation, which was an unexpectedly high 8.9 percent in January, a rise from December's 6.8 percent and November's 5.7 percent. In August, <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> implemented a program of voluntary wage and price controls, budget cuts and small regular devaluations in the austral. To convince Argentines not to put their money in dollars, which deprives the banking system of funds and drives up interest rates, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> made plenty of dollars available. Interest rates were kept attractively high, though well below levels of July and August. Through November the plan seemed to work. Inflation and monthly interest rates both returned to single digits, the dollar rose modestly and, of crucial importance, Argentines' purchasing power recovered from the months when it lagged behind inflation. Critics pointed out, however, that any improvement was illusory because it was obvious the dollar was undervalued, and as soon as that was common knowledge, speculators would buy dollars in anticipation of profits. The bubble burst in the first week of February, when Argentines bought $ 486 milliod to near 20 percent a month.

<TEXT>
 A controversial special relief program for Nicaraguan immigrants is being dismantled and city officials say it's time for the newcomers to fend for themselves. `` You have to kick them out of the nest,'' said <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, a volunteer dispatching some of the last Nicaraguans under city care to new homes. The city had assembled two shelters to handle the more than 300 aliens who were living in the <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Maduro </PERSON> Miami Stadium. They were lated placed in more than 80 apartments across <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. By Thursday, city workers sent off the last people from the shelters and did not plan to reopen them again. Most of the immigrants placed by the city wo n't have to pay their own rent until mid-March, and city officials said they wo n't be offered further help. The assistance drew criticism from black leaders in the wake of last month's disturbances in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s black neighborhoods. They claimed Hispanic immigrants were granted special privileges from the city, while blacks were relatively ignored and have always been left to fend for themselves. Critics of the city's recent decisions say the Nicaraguans are unlikely to be able to become self-sufficient because most wo n't have work permits while immigration officials decide whether they will be permitted to stay `` These people have really been thrown to the lions,'' said <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Correa </PERSON>, a volunteer at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which is continuing to provide food for some families. `` They have no papers, no money,'' <PERSON> Correa </PERSON> said. `` They have no way of getting a job.'' While the immigrant migration continues to <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, it has diminished in recent weeks. Most new arrivals are being absorbed by family and friends, officials said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European negotiators agreed over the weekend to a 75-day cooling off period in their increasingly abrasive trade war involving American beef containing growth hormones as they intensified their search for a compromise to resolve the dispute. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, holding her first discussions as the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's top trade negotiator, said Saturday substantial progress had been made in the two days of talks with representatives of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>'s top trade negotiator, said Sunday the agreement could help the two sides resolve the meat dispute. `` I do n't say we are close to a solution, but I think we are now in a situation which makes it easier to come to a solution,'' <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> said upon returning to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The two sides agreed to establish a high-level task force to study the issue over the next 75 days with the goal of coming up with ways to export hormone-free American beef to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The task force will also consider an American demand that a panel of experts should be established to consider whether growth hormones constitute a health risk. `` We made good progress in working out a procedure with respect to our differences in the hormone area,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> told reporters after the meeting ended. `` We have a high-level task force to deal with that issue, to work out the differences if at all possible.'' <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> said talks with officials of the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration gave him the impression `` we have a very positive environment for cooperation.'' He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials still contested the prohibition against hormone-treated beef, but `` they have accepted now that to ship the meat -LRB- they -RRB- have to comply with our requirements.'' Both President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and European officials have expressed a desire to defuse the trade dispute, fearing that the battle could aggravate tensions just at a time when the new administration is trying to forge closer ties with its European allies. The current trade dispute began on Jan. 1 when the Europeans imposed a ban on shipments of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef because the meat contained growth hormones used to fatten American cattle. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration charged that the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> action, which affected about $ 100 million in annual meat shipments, represented an unfair trade barrier and that there was no scientific evidence that the hormones were a health threat. In retaliation, the Americans slapped 100 percent tariffs on $ 100 million worth of European products, ranging from canned tomatoes to fruit wines and instant coffee. Those tariffs are just now showing up in higher prices at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grocery stores. The weekend negotiations were held in an effort to avoid a counter-retaliatory step threatened by the Europeans on Monday, when the governing body of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> will meet to consider imposing 100 percent tariffs on $ 100 million of American exports of walnuts and dried fruit. <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> said Saturday he could not speak for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> but he indicated that the progress made in the talks would likely postpone the second round of retaliation. <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> told reporters at a later briefing Saturday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had indicated it would lower its $ 100 million in tariffs by an amount equal to the shipments of hormone-free beef that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is able to make. He said consideration would be given to doubling the quota for high-grade beef. Last year, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shipped $ 32 million worth of such beef to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Such a step would make it more profitable for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ranchers to raise hormone-free beef. Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> also reported progress between the two sides over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand to end all trade-distorting farm subsidies, a position the Europeans have strongly objected to. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, briefing reporters on the condition that the official's name not be used, said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> offered a new proposal on the contentious farm subsidy issue and the matter was to be discussed by Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> MacSharry </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s commissioner in charge of agriculture, during talks on March 10 and 11 in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> The current round of talks being held to liberalize world trade, known as the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION>, have been stalled because of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> differences over farm subsidies. European officials characterized the get-acquainted talks, which also included <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, as helpful in understanding the position of the new administration. Trade between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> totaled $ 165 billion last year, making the 12-nation community <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest trading partner. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, referring to the beef dispute in his first address to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said last week that the major industrial countries needed `` to rise above fighting about beef hormones to building a better future, to move from protectionism to progress.'' A basis for compromise on the beef question was put forward by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> plan would involve isolating untreated cattle from birth through slaughter, giving them tests for artificial hormones and establishing enforcement procedures. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials say that similar programs meeting European standards have been proposed by <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. American officials have been anxious to get the dispute resolved because the battle had raised questions about American beef. `` The health ban is a signal that something is wrong with our beef,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said last week. `` Nothing is wrong with our beef.'' Nearly half of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cattle are now treated with growth hormones. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has maintained throughout the dispute that the daily production of hormones in humans, even in children, is far higher than the miniscule levels left in meat from treated animals.

<HEAD>Traders' Attorneys Ask Judge to Throw Out Some Wiretap Evidence,
Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge is being asked to declare illegal many of the secret tape recordings made by undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents during a two-year probe of suspected fraud at the world's two largest futures exchanges, according to reports published Saturday. The Chicago Sun-Times and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported that lawyers representing commodity traders are contending their clients should not be forced to hand over documents or appear before a federal grand jury because evidence against the traders came from improper recordings. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office have declined to confirm that an investigation is ongoing into allegedly fraudulent trading practices at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. But traders who have been subpoenaed and their attorneys have disclosed some aspects of the investigation. Several defense attorneys said in letters to government prosecutors and in closed-door arguments before Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> that many of the tape recordings made by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents amount to unauthorized wiretaps, the newspapers reported. While at least two lawyers identified by the <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> declined to confirm the filings, that newspaper and the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified sources as saying the motions were made in the last two weeks. The lawyers argue that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who posed as traders could only legally tape conversations in which they participated, and conversations in which the agents participated have not been challenged, the newspapers said. Federal law requires investigators to obtain court orders before taping conversations of people who have no reason to believe their discussion might be recorded. Otherwise, taping such conversations amounts to eavesdropping, and violates federal law, defense attorneys have argued. Shouldts of the investigation because of illegal wiretaps could refuse to cooperate with investigators, and use that fact in their defense in any subsequent court proceedings.

<HEAD>Strong Possibility of Strike at Eastern, Pilots Union Official Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: for Monday PMs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There's an `` eight-out-of-ten'' possibility of a work stoppage against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> as a March 3 strike deadline set by the militant machinists union approaches, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots union says. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crp </ORGANIZATION>., is `` looking at the abyss The evil empire is tottering,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, a member of the Eastern master executive council of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview Sunday. Sixteen months of talks on wages between Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> have resulted in no settlement, and the union will be free to strike legally March 4 if a 30-day cooling-off period mandated by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> expires without a new contract. The cooling-off period expires at midnight EST March 3. Intensified talks involving Eastern management, the Machinists and federal mediators are due to start on Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The two unions representing pilots and flight attendants at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> have said they would honor any picket line set up by the machinists, who represent about 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground personnel. `` We understand the risk -LRB- of striking -RRB-,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> said. `` The worst thing that can happen to us is that we lose our jobs.'' Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said the airline is `` guardedly optimistic'' that the dispute will be settled without a strike. `` We do n't want a strike. A strike is not in the company's or the unions' best interest,'' he said. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> reiterated <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s vow to continue operating in the event of a strike. Many financial analysts and other observers believe a bruising strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> could jeopardize the airline's survival. Eastern recently reported a record net loss of $ 335.4 million in 1988, nearly double its $ 181.7 million loss the year before. Revenue dropped to $ 3.8 billion from $ 4.4 billion in 1987. The airline's latest contract offer to the machinists calls for $ 150 million in wage cuts. <PERSON> George </PERSON> conceded that <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> could well put <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, liquidate its assets or sell it outright. He said pilots union officials have set up a meeting with Wall Street analysts and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> creditors later this week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to discuss the risk to creditors if there is a strike. The pilots held a similar session with analysts alone last September. Eastern currently has $ 550 million to $ 650 million in cash reserves, roughly equivalent to its accounts payable, <PERSON> George </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> put the reserve figure at around $ 400 million. `` Eastern has substantial cash reserves,'' the spokesman said. `` We keep our creditors well informed, and they know that they have no cause for concern.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> insisted a strike will occur `` if rational heads do n't prevail. The 3,400 Eastern pilots, he said, have been seeking talks with management for months with job security their primary issue. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president for human resources and chief labor negotiator, has told the pilots the company plans to contact their union on Tuesday to discuss a schedule for negotiations. However, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said, talks with the pilots have been made more difficult by Wednesday's scheduled start of `` super-mediation'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, which will tie up <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s top negotiators. He said the situation also has been complicated by the pilots union having recently changed the members of its negotiating committee.
