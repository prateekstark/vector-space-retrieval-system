 Two young men and two young women who apparently were inhaling laughing gas to get high were found dead Monday in a storeroom of a building housing a dental clinic, authorities said. The bodies were found shortly before noon in a small room near an empty tank of nitrous oxide, a gas used by dentists as an anesthetic, <LOCATION> Iron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. `` It's believed that they were inhaling the gas,'' he said. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said there was no sign of forced entry. He identified the victims as <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregerson </PERSON>, 18, and <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 19, both of <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherie </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 20, of Fillmore; and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Probert </PERSON>, 20, of Scipio. The bodies were sent to the state medical examiner's office for a determination of the cause of death, but <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said preliminary investigation shows they were asphyxiated. `` It's just a tragic accident and our hearts go out to the families,'' he said. `` We've never had injuries or deaths due to nitrous oxide. It's common throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for people to try to gain access to that to try to get high.''

 Territorial conflicts that brought about the war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> eight years ago will jeopardize the truce that both countries have accepted, an Iranian specialist in international law said Monday. A 1975 border treaty could be the solution and for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> there `` should be no questions,'' said <PERSON> Alireza </PERSON> <PERSON> Deyihim </PERSON>, deputy dean of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s diplomatic academy that is affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. He said in an interview that both countries had accepted the 1975 pact and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` clearly violated international law'' when it abrogated the treaty unilaterally in 1979. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in September 1980 after a series of border skirmishes. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed Monday to accept the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>'s call for a cease-fire. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution 598 also states that both <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> and Iranian forces should withdraw `` to the internationally recognized borders without delay'' after the cease-fire is in place. <PERSON> Deyihim </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> believes that phrase means the forces should withdraw to the borders agreed upon in the 1975 treaty between <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s government of <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlevi </PERSON> that was overthrown in 1979 in the revolt led by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. `` Both countries have ratified this treaty and announced ratification to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Deyihim </PERSON> said. `` That treaty settled all problems including the border in the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION>,'' the 120-mile waterway that flows into the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and forms the southern border between the warring neighbors. <PERSON> Deyihim </PERSON>, who entered <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign service 17 years ago and was involved in the 1975 treaty negotiations, said if <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had wanted to renegotiate parts of the agreement it could have used the complaints procedure that is part of the pact. He claimed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had removed many of about 570 markers set to delineate the 730-mile border after the 1975 treaty. `` They removed them ... and even pulled out trees'' that marked the border, he said. `` We hope that this -LRB- border issue -RRB- does not cause a delay in implementing the cease-fire.'' he added.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s doors are hesitantly open to a trickle of Americans seeking an experimental anti-AIDS drug that has not been approved for use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The drug, dextran sulfate, was developed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the 1960s and has been used to treat arteriosclerosis and high cholesterol. Within the last year, however, Japanese and American researchers have shown in the test tube that the compound is a potent agent against infection by HIV, which causes the fatal acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Now researchers are trying to determine whether dextran sulfate is effective when given to AIDS patients and whether they can take large doses over a long period. The drug's potential has received wide publicity, and some American AIDS sufferers or their friends have sought the drug in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` A year ago I started receiving calls from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> guys who asked if dextran sulfate was available,'' said <PERSON> Manabu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>, manager at the American Pharmacy in central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` I had no idea it could be used against AIDS.'' Now, <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> says, two or three Americans come in every month seeking dextran sulfate. The American Pharmacy is one of three pharmacies in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> area that were authorized two months ago to sell the compound under tight control _ but without a doctor's prescription _ by the <ORGANIZATION> Phamarceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, one of about a dozen makers of dextran sulfate in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` We talked it over with the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, and decided for humanitarian reasons it would be sold to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tourists,'' said <PERSON> Kowa </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Kazuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Endo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Endo </PERSON> said the company limited over-the-counter sales to three pharmacies because if dextran sulfate were widely available, it would be difficult to give proper warnings to purchasers. `` There could be damage, and we as a pharmaceutical company are quite worried about this,'' he said. A buyer at the American Pharmacy must sign a form in English stating how many tablets were purchased, that they were for personal use, that the drug is approved in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for treatment of high cholesterol at a dosage of 450-900 milligrams a day, and that it affects blood coagulation and should not be used by hemophiliacs. A separate page includes information on adverse reactions, such as skin eruptions, anorexia and diarrhea. The dosages being considered for AIDS therapy are much higher than routine use in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` We do n't have any information on this drug in such high dosage,'' <PERSON> Endo </PERSON> said, adding that if a patient takes a high dosage, `` the risks might be higher.'' He declined to name all three pharmacies permitted to sell the drug, though he said their names were well-known to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francicso </LOCATION> AIDS sufferers. He said <PERSON> Kowa </PERSON> was concerned that people that people with irrational fears of AIDS might experiment with dangerously high doses. The three pharmacies reportedly have anywhere from two to 30 customers per month. The company also worries that buyers might start a black market business exporting the drug, which sells at the American Pharmacy for $ 272 for 1,000 300-milligram tablets. <PERSON> Kowa </PERSON> is not doing AIDS research with dextran sulfate. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s leader in that area is a 70-year-old chemical firm, <ORGANIZATION> Ueno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION>, which has no medicines currently on the market Ueno is worried that its research, backed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, may be harmed by personal imports by American AIDS sufferers. `` From a humane point of view, we will not do anything'' to stop the drug's sale to Americans, said Dr. <PERSON> Ryuji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueno </PERSON>, director of the department of medicine at his family's company. `` We are just a little disappointed, though.'' At stake for the company is the possibility of a lucrative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market if the drug is proved effective. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> recently reaffirmed its policy of letting AIDS patients import drugs for their personal use even if they have not been approved. But the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> last week ordered inspectors to block imports of dextran sulfate from <ORGANIZATION> Polydex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, saying the Canadian company was promoting its unproven drug in violation of federal rules. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has approved clinical tests of <PERSON> Ueno </PERSON>'s dextran sulfate compound but approval for use of the drug in AIDS therapy still is a long way off, <PERSON> Ueno </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his laboratory near <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>. So far, he said, the drug has been tested for side effects on patients at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The current phase of tests, which began July 7, involves giving patients increasingly higher doses to see whether the drug is effective against HIV and to determine its side effects, <PERSON> Ueno </PERSON> said. The research is being done at nine AIDS-treatment centers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and will take six months. <PERSON> Ueno </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> had granted his compound `` open drug status,'' meaning authorities will help fund research and give the drug a protected market for seven years if it is successful. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has had only 80 AIDS cases, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>, so few that the drug could not be tested on patients. AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to child at or before birth.

 <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Poirier </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest deported from <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> after he criticized the military government, said in an interview Sunday he told his superiors last week that `` something could happen to me.'' `` I told them that if they heard I'd received a bullet in my head, do n't be surprised,'' <PERSON> Poirier </PERSON> said in the telephone interview. The priest, a native of <LOCATION> Cornwall </LOCATION>, Ont., arrived in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> Saturday on a flight from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> He was asked why be believed he could be the target of killers and said `` the system is becoming much more repressive and anything is possible.'' <PERSON> Poirier </PERSON> said he was expelled because he spoke out against injustice and encouraged the poor to organize politically. He acknowledged he had refused a military demand to provide a list of parish members who attended one of his recent religious services. He said the troopers who seized him Friday did not have a warrant for his arrest and did not know his name. `` All they knew was that I was the -LRB- parish -RRB- priest and therefore wicked,'' he said. <PERSON> Poirier </PERSON> gave this account of his expulsion: Several soldiers entered his parish in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Goave </LOCATION>, 30 miles southeast of the capital of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, and drove him to a prison where he was not allowed to call the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. The soldiers took him to the airport where he was placed aboard a commercial jetliner, and when he tried to resist they struck him with their rifles and threw him face down on the aisle. It was a New York-bound flight and after spending the night in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> he flew to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. A Haitian radio station said the government accused <PERSON> Poirier </PERSON> of making `` insulting public declarations which are liable to disturb the social and political order established in the country.'' A statement by the Canadian government said it was `` deeply distressed and unhappy at the cavalier way that Father <PERSON> Poirier </PERSON> was deported and -LRB- we -RRB- will be expressing our dissatisfaction to the Haitian authorities.'' <PERSON> Poirier </PERSON> was seized the same day that <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s leader, Lt.

 Forest fires killed 69 people and injured 116 in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the first half of the year, but the deaths represented a sharp drop from the same period a year ago, a newspaper reported today. An official of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> attributed the improved record to more rain in the north and stepped-up efforts to upgrade the nation's fire-fighting capabilities, the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily said. The number of deaths declined 48 percent over the same period last year, the unidentified official was quoted as saying. The official said there were 9,700 forest fires during the first half of the year, 33 percent fewer than for the same period of 1987; and that 120,694 acres of forest were burned through June, down 85 percent, the paper reported.

<TEXT>
 Elephants at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Zoo have forgotten the taste of bananas and tigers are now rarely thrown a live chicken. Hard times have befallen their keepers. The official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said today that the 3,000 animals, birds and fish at <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest zoo have come across lean days because of inadequate funding and sharp rises in food prices. With the quadrupling of banana prices in recent years, elephants have been put on a diet of nutritious but less palatable carrots, zoo officials said. Tigers now get just two meals a day, down from three, and are fasting one day a week, zoo officials said, explaining that the big cats are used to eating irregularly in the wild. In addition, tigers, lions and other carnivores that used to have a twice-weekly treat of a live chicken or rabbit now feast on such delicacies only when they are sick or weak. The report said the zoo had to give away its most popular seal because it could n't afford the annual expense of up to $ 13,500 in fish. `` We do n't want to adopt these cruel measures, but as our budget is tightened, there seems to be no other way around,'' the report quoted <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hongtao </PERSON>, office director of the zoo, as saying. The daily said expenses at the zoo have shot up from $ 1.1 million in 1984 to $ 1.9 million last year. The state last year provided $ 810,000, and the zoo had to make up the rest by introducing video games, bumper cars and other sources of recreation. Admission to the zoo costs less than a nickel. The zoo's chief accountant, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Qingchuan </PERSON>, said expenses may double next year because of swiftly rising food costs. Consumer prices rose 19 percent in June compared to the same month in 1987, while prices of some food items have nearly doubled in the past year with the elimination of some government price controls. The zoo opened in 1908 and is home to rare animals such as the giant panda and the golden monkey. It is one of the capital's main tourist attractions.

<TEXT>
 Americans believe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has moved toward racial equality during the past quarter century, but a majority say society remains racist overall, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll has found. Twenty-five years after the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> declared his dream of equal opportunity, more than eight in 10 respondents in the poll said the goal is closer and seven in 10 said it is attainable. But while 54 percent said blacks and other minorities have the same opportunities as whites in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a sizable 42 percent of all respondents, including 69 percent of blacks, disagreed. There were other measures of concern over inequality found by the national survey of 1,223 adults. Among them: _ Respondents were evenly divided on whether minorities receive equal treatment in the nation's criminal justice system, and three in 10 said minorities are denied justice because of their race _ Of those who said racial equality can be achieved, four in 10 said it would not occur within their lifetimes _ Majorities in all education, income and ideological groups, and all but the oldest age group, said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society is racist overall Fifty-three percent of whites agreed, as did 68 percent of blacks. In all, 55 percent said society is racist, 37 percent said not and the rest had no opinion. It was a quarter century ago, in August 1963, that <PERSON> King </PERSON> delivered his celebrated `` I have a dream'' speech to 200,000 demonstrators in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, establishing civil rights at the forefront of the nation's social agenda. `` I have a dream that one day on the red hills of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> sons of former slaves and sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.'' The Civil Rights Act became law a year later, prompting sweeping changes in the then-segregated South. But many Americans in the poll, particularly the better-educated, indicated that the advances are not complete. Among respondents with postgraduate degrees, only 28 percent said blacks and other minorities have the same opportunities as whites now. By contrast, 65 percent of those with only high school diplomas said there is equality. On the question of the criminal justice system, 46 percent of whites said minorities received equal treatment, but 40 percent said not, and nearly 15 percent did n't know. Sixty-one percent of blacks said minorities did not receive equal treatment in the criminal justice system. Even with the perceptions of inequality, the poll found divided opinion among blacks and solid opposition among whites to the practice of giving minorities preference in hiring and college admissions to address past inequalities. Forty-eight percent of blacks were in favor and 44 percent were opposed to preferential treatment in hiring, and they split 44-47 on preference in college admissions. More than 80 percent of whites opposed both. Despite their sense of racism and discrimination in society, 94 percent of the blacks said they had close friends who are white. A smaller share of whites, 67 percent, said they had close friends who are black. The Media General-AP poll consisted of telephone interviews June 22-July 2 with a randomly selected sample of adults across the nation, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the Tampa -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION> -RRB-.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll on civil rights was based on telephone interviews June 22-July 2 with 1,223 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Phone numbers were selected randomly by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult at each household who had the most recent birthday. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ 9 points, for example, for blacks, who made up 11 percent of the adjusted sample, their share of the adult population. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and responses in this poll; because of rounding, some totals may exceed 100: 1.

<DATELINE>MIDDLETON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 50 cars of a freight train derailed Monday, causing tankers to break open and spill a flammable industrial solvent, and forcing the evacuation of about 300 people overnight, authorities said. Authorities built a dike, using booms supplied by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, to keep the pool of liquid xylene from flowing into nearby <LOCATION> Beaver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Justus </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the state Environmental Protection Division. The <LOCATION> Elbert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department and officials with <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> estimated 57 cars in the 95-car <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> train derailed about 1:30 p.m. in this rural community. <ORGANIZATION> Elbert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> reported treating about 20 people who had breathed fumes from the liquid chemical, which is used in aviation fuel and as a solvent for resins, enamels and lacquers. None were seriously injured and all were released after `` they were washed down and looked at by a physician,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a hospital official. `` The primary hazard is that it -LRB- xylene -RRB- is flammable. There are vapors and fumes which are mildly toxic by inhalation or ingestion,'' Ms. <PERSON> Justus </PERSON> said. The fractured tanker, which contained about 30,000 gallons of xylene, leaked its contents at a rate that grew to 3,000 gallons an hour, she said. A second tanker also was leaking the chemical, although at a much slower rate, she said. Five of the derailed cars contained xylene, she said. <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said the train, which was headed to <LOCATION> Hamlet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, also carried coal, pulp board, lumber, soybean meal and a number of piggybacked truck trailers. He said the train was going about 35 mph when it derailed. There was no immediate indication of what caused the derailment. Cleanup was expected to begin after daylight Tuesday.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Reagan is Bush Surrogate with Conservatives</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A surrogate campaigner for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been trying to reassure the political right that the vice president is n't straying too far from conservative doctrine as he moves toward the center in his presidential campaign. The surrogate's name is <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Increasingly the president sprinkles his speeches with such phrases as `` Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I'' and `` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and me.'' He also has both praised and glossed over positions that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken that are at variance with his own conservative stands. In a recent speech to a group of evangelical youth, for example, he tackled the issue of day care for children. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has opposed government-subsidized child care proposals. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, trails in the polls among women voters and has attempted to close that `` gender gap'' with proposals including a $ 2.2 billion plan to give low-income families a $ 1,000-per-child tax credit for day care. Conservatives have generally been against this kind of thing, and it is one of a number of issues on which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been exploring new territory in a campaign that is expected to be fought out in the political center. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Evangelism, approached the matter this way: `` Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed an innovative plan, one that would strengthen the family. ... The basic idea here is that the government would simply let families keep up to $ 1,000 more of their own money. That's money the family itself can decide how to spend. Working mothers could put the money toward child care. But by giving each family this tax credit the vice president's plan would also permit thousands of mothers to choose to stay home with their children.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> suggests that even though it goes against the grain of traditional conservative thought, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s day-care program is really pro-family and amounts to a kind of tax cut _ things that conservatives like. The president also tiptoed around the differences between his position and the vice president's on abortion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he would accept abortion if necessary to save the life of the mother or in instances of rape and incest. The president has said repeatedly he would accept the operation only if needed to save the mother's life. The way <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spelled it out to the evangelicals was: `` Many who seek abortions do so in harrowing circumstances. And just as tolerance means accepting that many in good faith hold views different from our own, it also means that no man or woman should sit in judgment on another. I believe _ and Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> believes with me _ that we must rise above bitterness and reproach to find positive answers to the tragedy of abortion.'' No mention of their differences _ just `` positive answers'' for people in `` harrowing circumstances.'' As the campaign goes on, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to stake out increasingly independent stands. `` He's talking about education, he's talking about child care, soon he is going to be talking about flexibility in defense posture, he's talking about public service,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, a specialist in the presidency and electoral politics at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Not the usual fare for conservative rallies. So are <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s explanations part of a plan to bolster <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s conservative credentials `` I do n't know if it has been strategically laid out as such, but it makes sense,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` That is probably the single best way to use him.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' challenge to debate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on foreign policy and defense is the Democratic presidential nominee's confident counterattack in an area that could be either a weakness or a weapon for him. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' staff seemed taken aback by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claim last week that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would unilaterally disarm the nation, an unusually aggressive attack at this early stage of the general election campaign. `` Shrill'' was the way <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> described it as he delivered a series of escalating responses ending in the call for a mid-September debate on the issue. It had already been clear, however, that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would strive to paint <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as inexperienced and out of step on national security matters as the vice president moved to recover from a substantial deficit in the polls. Foreign policy, defense and national security concerns are widely regarded as the weakest areas for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for a variety of reasons. It is the one area in which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a statehouse politician, has no record. And despite his familiarity with several languages, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not a veteran traveler to foreign capitals. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, for all his image problems, can point to his experience in the international arena even before his vice presidency as ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been hammering away at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the foreign affairs missteps of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign clearly believes that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is vulnerable on the Iran-Contra affair, dealings with Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracting scandal and other problems. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> raised that criticism to a new level on Friday while campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> when he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't `` have what it takes'' to run the country. `` Anybody who sits there and does nothing while we trade arms to the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON>, and says he did n't know that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was doing drugs and running drugs -LRB- and -RRB- is a suspected murderer, and went to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in the early'80s and commended -LRB- <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for his commitment to democracy, in my judgment does n't have what it takes to lead this country when it comes to foreign policy,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. A day earlier, however, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had fed the impression he could misstep on military issues when he was questioned about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charges Asked initially if he still supported a nuclear freeze, which was debated before arms reduction talks began in 1985, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded `` sure.'' Moments later aboard his campaign jet, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides hastily arranged a news conference and brought the candidate back to where reporters were sitting on the plane. There, when asked, he clarified his response and said that the issue had moved beyond the question of a nuclear freeze to that of arms reductions. `` The reason we were all for the freeze originally was because we wanted to stop the administration from expanding the arsenal,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He said that had changed now that negotiations centered on reductions. `` Did I favor the freeze? Sure. I'm for reductions now. So's the administration,'' he said. `` I'm for developing certain weapons systems -LRB- and -RRB- for substantially reducing others.'' In attacking the Democratic nominee, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pointed to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' opposition to some new systems, particularly land-based nuclear weapons <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he does n't rule out modernization of the land-based arsenal _ that is, producing a new type of missile. Yet he opposes current options _ the MX and the smaller Midgetman. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides point to his support for other systems, such as the new Trident submarine-based missile and cruise missiles, and for development of the bomb-carrying Stealth aircraft. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> generally prefers to talk about his plans to beef up conventional forces, although he has not been specific on how to pay for expensive upgrades in equipment, weaponry, supplies and training. It is on conventional forces that he can be expected to focus if he gets that debate with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Big Cars Have Fewer Accident Claims</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The owners of 1988 passenger vans and large sedans are likely to have fewer damage claims and lower repair bills, while those who own sports cars and some compact cars may not be as lucky, according to an insurance industry report. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an insurance research group, examined both the frequency of insurance collision claims and the average amount of the claim for 60 new cars that had repairs paid through insurance policies during the first nine months of the 1988 model year. `` Even among cars of the same size class and body style there were large variations in results,'' the insurance group said. But it said that in general, larger cars had a better collision loss record than smaller vehicles. The average claim payment ranged from $ 800 to $ 3,500, depending on the type of vehicle. The frequency of claims ranged from six to nearly 17 per 100 vehicles, the study said. The study did not provide dollar amounts for all vehicle claims, but said the average repair bill for the 60 cars was $ 1,921. The average number of claims filed was 11.1 per 100 insured vehicles. It singled out the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astro </ORGANIZATION> van as having the lowest average loss payment per claim, 60 percent lower than average for all passenger vehicles examined. The Jaguar XJ6 had the highest, 83 percent higher than average for all cars, while the <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> MX-6 and the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION> also had average repair costs per claim that were at least 50 percent higher than average. The study said the passenger vehicles with `` substantially better than average'' results in both frequency of claims and average cost of repairs also were vans _ the <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caravan </ORGANIZATION> _ and two large, 4-door sedans _ the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caprice </ORGANIZATION> and the Mercury Grand Marquis. All four of these vehicles had claim frequencies and loss payments at least 30 percent below the average for all cars. The least number of claims per vehicles on the road involved the 4-door <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DeVille </ORGANIZATION> which had 46 percent fewer claims than average for all cars. At the other extreme, the cars with the poorest showing in both claim frequencies and repair costs were the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Chevrolet </PERSON> <PERSON> Camaro </PERSON>, both in the `` sports-speciality'' category, and the 2-door <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> MX-6 in the small car category. All three had claim frequencies and loss payments more than 20 percent above average. The Mustang had more than twice the average repair cost than reported for all cars _ the highest among the 60 cars _ and 32 percent more claims. The 2-door Toyota Celica had the most number of claims, 53 percent more than the average for all cars. While both the number of claims and the average cost of repairs ranged widely among vehicles of different size and design, the insurance group said they also varied significantly within groups of basically similar cars. For example, the frequency of claims among the `` small'' cars ranged from 12 percent below average for the Mercury Tracer to 53 percent above average for the Toyota Celica and 46 percent above average for the Pontiac LeMans. In the mid-size category, the frequency of claims ranged from 32 percent below average for the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celebrity </ORGANIZATION> to 29 percent above average for the Renault Medallion. Repair costs ranged from 21 percent below average per claim for the Celebrity to 25 percent above average for the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cavalier </ORGANIZATION>. The study examined 60 model 1988 passenger vehicles that had collision claims filed from June 1987 through February 1988. While there are about 400 various 1988 car types, only 60 had sufficient highway exposure during the period to be included in the study, the institute said.

For claim frequency, 100 is equivalent to 11.1 claims per 100 insured vehicles; for average loss payment per claim, 100 is equivalent to $ 1,921. -LRB- Example: a claim frequency 123 would reflect 23 percent more claims than average for all vehicles listed. A claim frequency of 88 would reflect 12 percent fewer claims than average for all vehicles listed. A repair cost figure of 82 reflects a cost 18 percent lower than average, while a repair cost figure of 166 reflects a cost 66 percent higher than average. -RRB-

<TEXT>
 Federal officials have begun contingency planning in case an out-of-control Russian satellite powered by a nuclear reactor plunges to earth inside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At the moment, `` we do n't anticipate at all that it will land on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` But we need to have our act together to respond to any catastrophic emergency, so we're coordinating an inter-agency effort right now.'' The planning work has drawn together representatives from the <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> in addition to the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the spokeswoman added. The various agencies are working to tailor <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>'s general `` Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan'' to deal with the possibility of radioactive satellite pieces being spread across the countryside, Ms. <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON> said. The agency's radiological emergency plan was originally developed in the wake of the <LOCATION> Three-Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> nuclear plant disaster, she added. The concern of the planners is a nuclear-powered, ocean-surveillance satellite launched by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last December 12 to keep track of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels. The satellite, designated by the Soviets as Cosmos 1900, began its life in space in a low circular orbit about 160 miles above the earth's surface. Soviet controllers unexpectedly lost radio contact with the craft in April and the Russian news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported May 11 that the satellite could fall to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in August or September. Soviet officials have insisted there is no reason to fear radioactive debris from the spacecraft's re-entry. But according to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials, the Soviets have apparently been unable to separate either the nuclear reactor or the fuel section from the rest of the satellite _ two common safeguards. That raises the possibility Cosmos 1900 could re-enter the atmosphere in one piece, meaning it might not burn up completely. That could spread harmful radioactive debris, just as <ORGANIZATION> Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> 954 did over <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in 1978. `` At the moment, it's still a one-piece satellite,'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Dugald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillies </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said recently. The orbit of Cosmos 1900 is continuing to decay and the spacecraft is now under constant surveillance, <PERSON> Gillies </PERSON> said. `` Re-entry is not imminent,'' he said. `` But the period for a revolution is continuing to decline and it's continuing to come in closer to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. We're keeping a close watch on it.'' While the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Space Command is not yet prepared to predict when the Russian satellite will re-enter the atmosphere, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said last week it thought the plunge would occur in mid-September. `` Cosmos 1900 is expected to re-enter around the middle of September, give or take four weeks,'' the agency said in a statement. `` Only a few days before the satellite re-enters can the entry location be predicted. `` Until then, experts can only say that Cosmos 1900 will re-enter somewhere between latitudes 65 degrees north and 65 degrees south'' _ meaning anywhere in the world between the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circles </LOCATION>. `` It's not coming down as fast as originally anticipated, but it's coming down,'' added Ms. <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON>. Should Cosmos 1900 fall within <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders, <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> will have an emergency response team ready, she said. The size and composition of the response team will depend upon a variety of factors, including whether the satellite debris is radioactive and where it lands, she said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has launched more than 30 nuclear-powered satellites over the years and in at least two cases, radioactive debris from such satellites has fallen to the Earth's surface. Besides the crash of <ORGANIZATION> Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> 954 over <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in 1978, the nuclear core of Cosmos 1402 splashed into the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> in 1983.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> has agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3 billion in one of the most expensive media deals ever and one that would add TV Guide, the nation's largest-selling weekly magazine, to his empire The purchase of the privately-held company from <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> includes two other publications: the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Form </ORGANIZATION> and Seventeen magazine, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said Sunday. `` These publications are the most valuable and prized publishing properties in the world,'' <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said in a statement announcing the purchase by his <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The purchase of TV Guide raises anti-trust questions because of <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s ownership of the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Access </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based public interest telecommunications firm. But a spokesman for <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said TV Guide would be run separately from <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s other holdings, which include newspapers and magazines on four continents. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> began negotiating with the 80-year-old <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> for Triangle a month ago. `` They -LRB- the Triangle publications -RRB- have been developed brilliantly by Ambassador <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> and we plan to make them the cornerstone of a great American publishing company,'' <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON>, chairman of Triangle, said in a statement: `` I am very happy that my publications are passing to Mr. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s company I now plan to devote the rest of my life to education and philanthropy.'' His past philanthropies include the establishment of the <ORGANIZATION> Annenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, to which he has given one-third of Triangle's stock over the years. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> were in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and would have no further comment, said <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>. The spokesman declined to say who initiated the talks for the sale, which is contingent upon signing of a final contract. The largest media takeover was <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 3.5 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON>, who was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the Court of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> during the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration, took over Triangle from his father in the 1930s. He founded TV Guide in 1952 and it quickly became Triangle's flagship, earning an estimated $ 75 million per year. TV Guide has an audited circulation of more than 17 million copies. Triangle was valued at about $ 1 billion last year by Wall Street analysts. `` The three best businesses in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Form </ORGANIZATION>, TV Guide and the Wall Street Journal,'' <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> said in a 1987 interview, when he indicated that the three publications would be sold before 1990. <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON> said joint ownership of TV Guide and the Fox network could allow <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> to use the publication to favor <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> programs and stations. Such treatment could hurt small independent TV stations, for which TV Guide is an essential advertising medium, said <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON>. `` Any media conglomeration of this scope ought to set off warning signals at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> said, `` The TV Guide will be run totally independent of all Mr. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s other interests.'' <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, 58, is perhaps best known in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for his work at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which he purchased in 1976 and converted from one of the country's most liberal dailies to a conservative paper with screaming headlines. He sold the Post earlier this year to conform with federal regulations barring dual ownership of a television station and a newspaper in the same city. His holdings have an estimated value of $ 2.2 billion.

<HEAD>GOP Delegates Aren't Choosy on Vice President Selection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Delegates to the Republican National Convention are n't particularly choosy about a vice presidential candidate, with the largest group inclined to accept anyone <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> selects. In an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey, the `` candidate'' backed by the largest group of delegates, 39 percent, was nobody in particular. Two former presidential candidates, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, each were favored by 14 percent. Others mentioned by a smattering of delegates included <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, major league baseball Commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> communications director <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> and a couple of otherwise unknowns whose candidacies were advanced by relatives who happen to be delegates Of the 1,274 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates responding to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> survey, 492 said they had no particular choice for the No. 2 spot on the party's ticket That sentiment is not at all uncommon as delegates tend to defer to whatever decision their party's presidential nominee makes on the issue of a running mate. Two-thirds of the Democratic delegates did not name anyone as their choice for vice president, but when <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate, that decision was endorsed by acclamation at last month's convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he will not announce his running mate until Aug. 18, the final day of the Republican convention. The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> survey did show some sentiment for a female vice presidential candidate. Polls have shown that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lags behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> among female voters, and 10 percent of the delegates responding to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> survey said one way to overcome this would be to pick a woman as his running mate. Fourteen percent of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates scattered their support among four women: former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, who was named by 82 delegates, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, supported by 79 delegates, Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> with 17 delegates and <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> with five delegates. <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> has said she does not want to be considered for the vice presidential spot, as has <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, who was named as the choice of two dozen delegates. The delegates' vice presidential choices cut across lines of education, gender and political experience, with roughly the same percentages of college graduates supporting <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, for example. The survey was conducted by <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> bureaus in all 50 states, as well as <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and is based on responses from 56 percent of the 2,277 delegates who will attend the GOP convention.

 <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haid </PERSON>, who portrayed Officer <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Renko </PERSON> on television's old `` Hill Street Blues'' and stars in the movie `` The Rescue,'' was plucked from the ocean after he took a spill off his sail boat. <PERSON> Haid </PERSON>, 40, said he was never in danger after falling from the catamaran about a mile off <LOCATION> Broad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> on Saturday afternoon. He said a couple pulled him from the water 45 minutes later. <PERSON> Haid </PERSON> said he fell into the water while trying to attach himself to a harness that allows him to lean out over the water as the wind-tipped boat rides on one pontoon. `` I was hooking on, my hook slipped and I went off the back,'' <PERSON> Haid </PERSON> said after the accident. His brother, who also was on the boat, lost sight of him, and went back to shore for help. The actor, who was wearing a wet suit and a life preserver, said he `` would have just floated ashore'' if the unidentified couple had n't come along.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, whose 38-year career as a federal judge included decisions on major cases balancing individual rights and government power, has died at age 77. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who participated in the Pentagon Papers case and wrote the decree ending de facto segregation in the nation's capital, died Saturday of cancer. He had retired last year after 25 years on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here _ two as chief judge _ and 13 years as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District judge in his native <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, whose full name was <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in 1934 and became an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney three years later. Following military duty in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to practice law before being named <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in 1948. The next year, at the age of 38, he was appointed to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, becoming the youngest man to hold the post at that time. After his 1960 order desegregating the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> school system drew threats against his life, President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> reassigned <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. In 1967, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s order overturned the District school system's racially separate `` tracking system'' for grouping students The `` Wright decree,'' in addressing de facto segregation, was considered one of the most significant education rulings since the 1954 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision outlawing the doctrine of `` separate but equal'' schools. In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case involving an attempt by the government on national security grounds to restrain publication of military documents by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, he dissented from the ruling of two other judges on a three-member appeals court panel. In favoring the right of the newspaper to publish, he wrote: `` To allow a government to suppress free speech simply through a system of bureaucratic classification would sell our heritage far, far too cheaply.''

The Jordanian monarch made the comments to reporters Sunday as draft documents calling for an independent Palestinian state circulated in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupied lands, where the uprising entered its ninth month today. By severing administrative ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has challenged the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to make good on its claims to leadership in the territory that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized from his family's control 21 years ago. Without hesitation, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> told foreign reporters on Sunday that he would `` immediately'' recognize a Palestinian government-in-exile. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Sunday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> indicated the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had not abandoned hope <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> will play an important role in the peace process. `` <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> has been and will remain a strategic anchor for peace in the region,'' the assistant secretary of state told reporters. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s -RRB- interest is in peace, and I assume his actions were taken toward that goal.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has relied heavily on <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> as a stand-in for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to recognize. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was scheduled to travel to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> today for talks. He said dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is possible, but <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would only lead to further violence in the occupied lands. Despite the Israeli occupation, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> has maintained heavy economic and political ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Its dinar is the dominant currency and many Palestinians carry Jordanian passports. In the past two weeks, the king has scrapped a $ 1.3-billion development plan for the territories, laid off or retired 21,200 Jordanian employees there and shut the separate ministry for territorial affairs in his government. He said Sunday the option of reversing these measures `` does not exist.'' `` We are in a new reality of position,'' the king said in a somber tone, adding: `` <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> has no sovereignty over the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> ... both belong to the Palestinian people.'' It is not clear how <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s moves may affect the Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands, which has claimed the lives of at least 237 Arabs and four Israelis. But Palestinians and others have suggested <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is trying to pressure the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to make good on its claims of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leadership. If the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> fails, the argument goes, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> might be ready to step back in. Commenting on measures to be taken regarding citizenship, the king said that `` passports will all remain -LRB- with <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> citizens of Palestinian origin -RRB- until a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state is created and they can choose their own citizenship.'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> also denied media reports that both bridges linking <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> are to be closed down. `` Bridges are the lifeline,'' he said. `` We have no intension to close them ... nor has it -LRB- the idea -RRB- crossed our minds.'' The king said he hoped to see the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s mission in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> `` enjoy the diplomatic status like other missions ... like an embassy.'' He said, however, that `` we have nothing to say to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation'' that is due to visit <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> later in the week, though adding `` we shall keep in touch in the future ... there are no differences between us.'' Palestinian sources in the occupied territories, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sunday that a draft of a declaration of independence had been forwarded to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> for approval. The Israeli daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday published what it said was a draft declaration of independence signed by 152 Palestinians. The declaration called for a state based on a 1947 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> partition plan, which would encompass much of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as well as the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. A different draft obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> made no mention of 1947 borders, calling for a state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> with Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as its capital. Both draft versions said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would be president of a government-in-exile. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television on Saturday said one draft version of the declaration was seized by Israeli security forces during a search at the east <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> immediately after the institute's leader, <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, was arrested on Aug. 1.

<HEAD>Writers Ratify Contract; Producers Gear Up to Salvage Devastated
TV Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Writers are back to work trying to salvage the fall TV season after ratifying a contract that ends one of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s longest strikes, but it could be weeks before scripts reach producers. Some scriptwriters sat down in front of word processors and typewriters after the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> overwhelming ratified the four-year contract Sunday. `` A lot of them are already going to work and they will be working night and day now. Business is going to be booming,'' said <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most people expect to see the first finished scripts for episodes in about four weeks.'' The guild approved the pact with the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> by 2,111 to 412, or 83.7 percent, said guild President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON>. The 22-week walkout by the 9,000 members crippled <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and will delay the start of the fall TV season, perhaps until November. Writer <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> was anxious to return to work on a new HBO series and feature film he is co-writing with partner <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Natain </PERSON>. `` I'm going to try to pick up all the momentum we lost during the 22-week layoff,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. Ratification came in the 154th day of the longest strike ever to cause a major disruption of film and television production. Hollywood has endured a more protracted strike, involving musicians, but the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>'s longest previous walkout, in 1960, lasted 153 days. The impact of the strike, which began March 7, reached beyond writers, producers and behind-the-scenes personnel, affecting businesses including equipment rentals and caterers and has cost the television networks tens of millions of dollars. Producers are `` pleased that the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> membership has ratified the new agreement and we are able once again to get this industry back to work,'' said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Counter </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, president of the 217-member alliance. Divisiveness, however, was expected to linger, Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. `` It was a very difficult time. Over a period of time, some of the rancor and anger will be forgotten. I do n't think the spirit will be forgotten, though. They -LRB- the writers -RRB- will remember this for a long time,'' she said. The financial loss to union members was estimated at $ 500,000 each week, and the guild paid out more than $ 2 million in hardship loans to members. The median income for working union members is $ 43,000, although the guild does have some millionaires. In arguing for acceptance of the proposal, guild negotiators said the pact would provide writers more creative control over scripts and over the re-acquisition of original screenplays. But the union acknowledged it was not very successful in winning larger payments for reruns of television programs sold to foreign markets, a major strike issue. `` We went in looking for modest improvements and we made achievements in all those areas,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. Writers will choose between the existing formula, which pays a maximum of about $ 4,400 for a one-hour show rerun abroad, or a plan that pays 1.2 percent of the producer's foreign sales, within a range of 85 percent to 130 percent of the current payment. Television producers usually make up production costs with their share of payments for reruns of prime-time shows. Rising production costs and reduced demand for expensive hourlong shows prompted the producers to propose revisions for domestic reruns. Under the new formula, payments for domestic one-hour reruns would be tied to sales of the show as opposed to a set dollar amount. Writers have been earning about $ 16,000 for one-hour programs, but under the new system that could range from $ 8,000 to $ 24,000, depending on the syndication sales. Writers can seek a return to the fixed-payment formula through binding arbitration if the syndication market improves. The contract also calls for salary increases of 5 percent in the first 18 months, another 5 percent in the next 18 months and 4.5 percent the fourth year.

<HEAD>Cruise Ship Attack Frightens Away American Tourists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HELENA SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A terrorist attack aboard a cruise ship last month has frightened thousands of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> away from this country that depends so highly on foreign vacationers, tourism officials report. <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> island-hopping cruises have begun to regain popularity but hotel and tourism officials say the July 11 gun and grenade assault aboard the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> cruise ship led to a wave of hotel cancellations. The terrorist action left nine dead and more than 90 injured. The attack occurred as the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> returned from a one-day island-hopping tour with 471 passengers aboard. Killed in the attack were three French citizens, two Hungarians, a Dane, a Swede and two unidentified men. No Americans were among the casualties. Greek security officials have still not established who was responsible for the assault and no arrests have been made in connection with the case. The <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> organization, a Palestinian group known for other terrorist attacks, is suspected of involvement. Most of the hotel cancellations have been by American business people who planned to attend conferences in the Greek capital and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> vacationers on tour groups, hotel officials said. They said Europeans did not appear to have been frightened away by the attack. `` Three major business conferences that were to be attended by some 900 Americans were canceled almost immediately after the ship massacre,'' <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Veloudakis </PERSON>, public relations manager at the <ORGANIZATION> Intercontinental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. About 400,000 American vacationers were expected to visit <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in 1988, a 65 percent increase over last year's figure of 260,000, leading tourism officials said. According to <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Despotopoulou </PERSON> of the government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, about 4,000 Americans canceled their visits in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Tour operators estimated the figure was much higher. `` Since the attack we've had a great drop in American visitors,'' said a tour operator who asked not to be named. `` Our bookings are down by approximately 10 percent compared to last year. `` Cruises are gradually picking up again but there was a noticeable slump in their popularity following the attack,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Despotopoulou </PERSON>. `` A lot of tourists, and particularly the Japanese, stopped going on them and took up classical tours by bus instead.'' In 1987, 8 million tourists visited <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, led by Britons and West Germans, totaling 1.9 million and 1.2 million respectively. Tourism is <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s biggest foreign exchange earner. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greece </ORGANIZATION>, tourists brought in approximately $ 2.2 billion in foreign exchange in 1988, more than 5 percent of the country's gross national product. American visitors to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> dropped dramatically in 1985, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> issued a travel advisory on the potential danger of flying to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> after the hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner. The plane was seized during a flight from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> navy diver was murdered by the hijackers and 39 other poeple were held captive for 17 days until their eventual release in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> lost $ 100 million in tourism revenues because of terrorism in 1985, according to official figures of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. The cruise ship industry _ always popular among high income earners _ was the hardest hit, with Americans canceling 35 percent of their bookings. When the 1985 advisory was lifted after six weeks, the Greek government set about trying to lure tourists, especially Americans, with an expensive publicity campaign. Top tourism officials say the country plans a similar publicity campaign in an effort to blunt negative reaction from last month's attack

<DATELINE>GALVESTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For the third time in four years, residents vote on a referendum to allow casinos, with the opposition saying approval could return <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> to the days when illegal gambling and prostitution flourished. But Galvestonians for <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, the pro-gambling group that initiated a petition to bring the issue before voters Saturday, speak of the jobs and money such an industry could bring to this tourist-oriented island city suffering high unemployment. The contest has been a feverish, complete with phone banks, rallies and an advertising war. `` It's been very divisive. It's a decision between two entirely different choices for the future of our city,'' said H.L. `` Shrub'' <PERSON> Kempner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, co-chairman of Galvestonians Against Casino Gambling. `` It is a question of whether we become contaminated by the casinos ... in terms of trashing our town or whether we move on toward other ways of developing our economy,'' <PERSON> Kempner </PERSON> said. The non-binding referendum asks voters in this scity of nearly 200,000 residents to approve a gambling district that proponents say will consist of four casino hotels with at least 500 rooms each. Voters rejected legalized gambling proposals in 1984 and 1987. But gambling promoters say last November's statewide approval of pari-mutuel horse racing signals a change in attitude that will be reflected in voter approval Saturday. They also are optimistic that proposals to limit the size of the district and earmark a percentage of its proceeds to benefit the elderly will help win support. `` It's similar to ... pari-mutuel gambling and bingo and lots of other things in state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> that had to be attempted several times,'' said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Fredriksen </PERSON>, chairman of Galvestonians for Economic Development. Both sides admit that polls show voters evenly split on the gambling question, with about 10 percent to 15 percent undecided. The winner may well be decided by which side gets the highest turnout. The referendum, if approved, would require the passage of similar legislation in the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before returning for a binding local-option vote. Rep. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Criss </PERSON> supports the casino district, while Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hury </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney, opposes it. State Sen. <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, meanwhile, says he is duty-bound to introduce the legislation if it passes. Law enforcement officials also have joined in the debate. `` When we study what's happened with casino gambling in other locations, we see a tremendous amount of street crime and we also see organized crime's involvement with casinos,'' said <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON>, adding that tax benefits would be outweighed by the increased demands on law enforcement and courts. But <PERSON> Fredrikson </PERSON> dismisses such speculation. `` I keep telling them, ` Guys, you've been watching too many `` Godfather'' movies,''' he said. `` We believe that these casinos would be an economic tool to expand our economy. The estimates are that they would create 20,000 direct and indirect jobs and put over $ 600 million on the tax rolls here,'' <PERSON> Fredrikson </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate this year has ranged from 11 percent to 8.9 percent, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Its 9.7 percent June rate compared with nearby <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s 7.7 percent, and ranked 21st out of 27 metropolitan areas in the state. <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> became a haven of crime and vice in the 1950s before a government crackdown ran casino and slot machine operators out of business.

<TEXT>
 Publications on teen fashion, television and horse racing are the newest divergent entries in <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s wide-ranging communications empire <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s $ 3 billion agreement to buy <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION>, publishers of <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guide </ORGANIZATION>, Seventeen magazine and the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Form </ORGANIZATION>, from <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> was announced Sunday. It was the latest deal by a man who parlayed a small family newspaper in his native <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> into billions of dollars in broadcasting, book, newspaper and magazine holdings on four continents, including the fledgling <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. The prospect of having the same man own TV Guide and a television network raised some eyebrows, but <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said the popular magazine will be operated independently from his other holdings. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> citizen, assumed ownership of his father's paper, the tiny <ORGANIZATION> Adelaide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, and built from there. His wife, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, met him while working as a reporter at one of his Australian papers. In 1969, he purchased <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>, a London-based tabloid. In addition to sensationalist stories, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> added daily photos of bare-breasted women. Circulation soared from 950,000 to 4 million. Later, he took over the respected newspapers <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s early <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> acquisitions included the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- Express and News, a daily newspaper, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, a weekly gossip magazine. He owned both when he paid $ 30 million for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in 1976. Though bare breasts did not become a commonplace on the pages of the Post, other aspects of his style were evident: conservative editorial stance, screaming headlines, outrageous stories. Circulation increased, but did not bring a similar increase in advertising revenue. But if he lost millions at the Post, the rest of his empire flourished: Profits for the <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, his worldwide company, were 32 times higher when <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> sold the paper in February than when he bought it 12 years earlier. While running the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> also purchased the iconoclastic liberal weekly the <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>, which he has since sold, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> magazine. <PERSON> Adweek </PERSON> named him Publisher of the Year in 1982. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> during the mid-1970s. After becoming an American citizen in 1985, he began buying television stations. But an enemy made with his stance at the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> came back to haunt him. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., got legislation passed setting an imminent deadline for enforcement of a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> rule requiring <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> to end his dual ownership of newspapers and television stations in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> During his presidential run in 1980, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was hammered repeatedly by the Post. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> papers also delighted in running photos of an overweight <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> with headlines like `` <PERSON> Tubby </PERSON> <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON>.'' `` You seldom achieve big things in life without making some enemies on the way,'' <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said earlier this year. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> still owns the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> paper; his other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> newspaper holding is the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. His efforts these days are focused on converting <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> into the nation's fourth commercial network. And <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> has promised to keep looking for new deals. `` Now you're going to see joint ventures and start-ups _ new newspapers, magazines and television services,'' <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said five months before swinging the $ 3 billion <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> deal.

Ambassador <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> leaves a business his father began but he saved, partially with the addition of the highly successful TV Guide. <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> on Sunday announced that <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> would buy the Radnor-based <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3 billion The sale will give <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Form </ORGANIZATION>, Seventeen magazine and TV Guide, the largest-selling weekly magazine in the country with an audited circulation of more than 17 million copies. The 80-year-old <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON>, chairman of Triangle and friend of President <PERSON> Reagans </PERSON>, also claimed The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer and the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in his empire until 1969, when he sold the papers to <ORGANIZATION> Knight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a forerunner of <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON>, in a statement, said: `` I am very happy that my publications are passing to Mr. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s company I now plan to devote the rest of my life to education and philanthropy.'' Born in 1908, <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> was the son of <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON>, who owned <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Form </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, which transmitted race results from tracks to bookie offices. But while <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> made money, up to $ 6 million a year, he failed to comply with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tax laws and was sentenced in 1940 to three years' imprisonment for tax invasion. He was released for treatment of a brain tumor and died in 1942. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON>'s biographers say the death of his father provided the impetus for the son's career. A plaque kept by <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> states his driving force, `` Cause my works on earth to reflect honor on my father's memory.'' His motto is, `` Adversity. It either inspires you or destroys you.'' In his 30s, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> took over the family business, including the papers but minus the wire company. The business was worth $ 3 million to $ 4 million, but the family's debts included $ 4 million in back taxes. To pay off the debts, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> streamlined the business and sold real estate. Forbes magazine puts <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON>'s personal worth now at $ 1 billion. His share of Triangle is 35 percent. <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> divides his time between three homes: a mansion in suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a 273-acre spread in <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mirage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where he plays host to the Reagans, and a home in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> with a view of Pikes Peak. He was appointed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the Court of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> by then-President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and was later made an honorary knight. <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> is also known for his art collection, which includes works by <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Matisse </PERSON> and <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>. He estimates its value at $ 400 million. <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> has donated millions to charities and the arts, and founded the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Annenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>President Of State-Run Railroad Resigns After Second Fatal Wreck</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state-run railroad's chief resigned after a second fatal train crash in six weeks and union leaders claimed the accidents stemmed from the government cutting corners at the expense of safety. Transport Minister <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Delebarre </PERSON> said he accepted the resignation offered Sunday by 53-year-old <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouvillois </PERSON>, who had been president of the railroad for just six months. Union leaders said the <PERSON> Rouvillois </PERSON>' resignation would only gloss over a fundamental problem _ the government's scrimping on safety to save money. A 29-year-old man was killed and 57 people were injured Saturday when a four-car passenger train crashed into a barrier at the end of the line in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' Gare de L'Est station. On June 27, a train crash at another <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> station, the <LOCATION> Gare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, killed 56 people and injured 32. That accident was blamed on brake failure. Seven of Saturday's injured remained hospitalized Sunday, none of them in a life-threatening condition, hospital officials said. An initial investigation indicated the cause of Saturday's crash was mechanical failure _ not human error. The railroad, known by its French initials as <ORGANIZATION> SNCF </ORGANIZATION>, said the conductor applied the brakes, which appeared to work normally, but the engine drove the train into the barrier anyway. The two major accidents and several minor incidents have heightened concern about safety on the railroads. On Saturday night, <PERSON> Delebarre </PERSON> said instructions given by the government after the June 27 crash had not been adequately followed. `` I do n't believe in fate,'' he said. `` The safety instructions given on July 20 to the -LRB- railroad -RRB- board of directors ... remain still insufficiently followed up.'' Those measures included stricter checks on braking equipment, more training of mechanics on brake equipment, and installation of telephone links between passenger cars and the driver. In 1985, during a series of three accidents in which 75 died and nearly 200 were injured, <ORGANIZATION> SNCF </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Chadeau </PERSON> also resigned. `` You can change a man once again, but you will only solve the problems by answering their causes,'' said the Socialist-run French Democratic Confederation of Labor. The Communist-led <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s largest union, said, `` The government is trying to camouflage its own responsibility.'' Both unions blamed the accidents on the government's railroad policy, which they say is based mainly on saving money. The current plan is to reduce the <ORGANIZATION> SNCF </ORGANIZATION>'s work force by 10,000 a year over the next four years. Railway officials said the driver during Saturday's crash told them he noticed nothing unusual during his run from Chateau <PERSON> Thierry </PERSON>, 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, until he entered the Gare de L'Est. Then, he said, he applied the brakes but could not stop the train. A review of the train's black-box recorder indicated the driver correctly braked and the train slowed down, <ORGANIZATION> SNCF </ORGANIZATION> officials said. But the recording showed that while braking appeared normal, the engine continued to push the train, which entered the station at 12 mph to 19 mph. `` It's like having your foot on the accelerator and the brake at the same time,'' said <ORGANIZATION> SNCF </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Chenel </PERSON>. The train, which <PERSON> Chenel </PERSON> said was about four years old, is what is known as a `` reversible,'' meaning it can be either pulled by an engine or pushed by it. When it is pushed, the driver controls the train from a cabin in the first car. The train was being pushed when the first car slammed into the barrier, rode up on it and twisted at a right angle. The other three cars and the engine remained on the tracks. Most likely, there was a malfunction in the control cable connecting the driving cabin in the first car and the engine at the rear, the railway officials said. Separate investigations were being carried out by the railroad and police.

 A man was reunited with his wife early today, five hours after he drove away from a gas station thinking she was asleep in the back only to find out she had gone to the restroom, police said. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, 62, of <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> <PERSON> Heights </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, realized his wife, <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON>, 56, was missing after he stopped 100 miles away at a McDonald's, bought her a cheeseburger but found the back of his van empty upon returning. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> went back to the gas station, but it was closed.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says blacks and Jews should form a council to air their disagreements, a step he advocated in a meeting with Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met Sunday with <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> in a session that both men described as cordial but which also included disagreements over the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, most notably <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for Palestinian self-rule. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said that during the 2 -LCB- - hour meeting at <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>'s home, he proposed creating `` some kind of council'' or `` conduit for communication'' so that the two groups, historical allies on civil rights, can talk with each other when they disagree <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>, in an interview today with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> state radio, said he tried to make clear to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that private citizens should not try to mediate the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict. `` One can not expect people, no matter how talented or well-known, to mediate between us and our neighbors. It is more appropriate to leave these kinds of jobs to governments concerned,'' <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I also noted the very disconcerting anti-Semitic phenomena that have been reported recently, especially in his city, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and I noted that ... his voice was not heard in condemnation,'' <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> said. The former Democratic presidential candidate, who has a history of poor relations with Jewish groups, initiated the meeting with <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>. After the session, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters he had invited <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> to visit him in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, his home town. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is supporting <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign, but said he acted independently in setting up the meeting with the ambassador Although <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> did not shy away from controversial subjects, he refused to detail many of the points of contention. `` I did share my points of view,'' he said, adding he would `` keep them private.'' Rather, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stressed that the meeting allowed the men to get to know each other personally. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he did advocate self-determination for the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> along with security for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, an issue the men delved into in `` depth and detail.'' `` Israelis and Palestinians are trapped in a death grip'' which must be broken, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He said he would ultimately like to see an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> issued a statement in which he said the session `` provided a useful opportunity to review the situation in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, especially the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, to discuss issues of mutual concern and to clarify points of difference.'' <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Elson </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, described the mood at the meeting which he helped to organize as `` gracious, generous.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Mervin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>, D-Calif., also took part in the meeting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s relations with the organized Jewish community have long been strained by a number of factors, including his strong support for Palestinian rights and a derogatory remark about Jews in the 1984 campaign.

 Overcrowding and safety violations caused an aging ferry to capsize in the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, killing as many as 400 people, a government report said. The ferry accident was said to be <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s worst ever. Strong currents hampered efforts today to pull the two-decker from the rising monsoon-swollen river. Hundreds of relatives stood by watching. A senior government official, discussing the confidential report on condition of anonymity, said authorities believed at least 300 people on the lower deck died when the ferry overturned Saturday morning. About 200 people were on the upper deck, he said. Authorities believe about 100 people swam to safety or were rescued by villagers. Only about a dozen bodies have been found, and most of the missing were believed trapped inside the 35-year-old ferry. `` It was badly overcrowded. The situation was made more dangerous by wheat bags loaded on the ferry. Many lives could have been saved if the ferry had carried water safety equipment such as life jackets,'' said the senior official. Survivors said they protested when 150 bags of wheat were loaded onto the ferry. The steam-powered vessel started wavering soon after it left the banks and capsized about 100 yards from the shore. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> divers attempted to reach the submerged boat today, but the river was too muddy and its current too swift, said H.S. <PERSON> Pathak </PERSON>, head of the eight-member diving team. `` We are trying our best, but because of the current, we are not able to go near the launch,'' <PERSON> Pathak </PERSON> said. `` The water is too muddy. We ca n't see anything, so we just have to feel by our hands.'' Authorities said the water was still rising and the submerged boat was sinking in the river bed. The water depth was estimated at 12 to 30 feet. Katihar Commissioner <PERSON> Madan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> estimated the boat was resting in about six feet of sand. `` We are planning to break the ferry. Only then will we be able to get the bodies out,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Katihar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief P.S. <PERSON> Natarajah </PERSON> said chances of finding any survivors were `` very, very dim.'' He said the death toll may never be known because some bodies probably were carried downstream 30 to 60 miles by the surging water. The ferry was designed to carry about 160 people, but was was always overcrowded, he said. Jetty workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 535 tickets were sold for the trip. Katihar Police Inspector <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> said about 2,000 relatives and residents were waiting along the rain-swollen river for the bodies to be recovered. `` Police are trying to control the crowds and console them,'' he said. Family members railed against authorities as numerous officials arrived to review recovery efforts. `` Give back our family members. We do n't want -LRB- government -RRB- ministers,'' they shouted. One survivor, <PERSON> Chadrasekhar </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiwary </PERSON>, said he was standing on the ferry's upper deck when it started wavering. `` As soon as the ferry tilted, I knew we were going down. I saw three women crying for help. They probably drowned,'' the 50-year-old farmer said. <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON> <PERSON> Yadaw </PERSON>'s wife and four other family members vanished in the accident. `` The women and children suffered the worst. They had to sit on the lower deck,'' he said. `` I am sure my wife is dead.'' It was the worst boat accident ever in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>. At least 150 people died on July 5, 1970, when a boat capsized in <LOCATION> Krishna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> divers came from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, the Indian capital about 650 miles west of <LOCATION> Katihar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mangan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chand </PERSON>, a police officer, said only one body surfaced near the ferry Sunday. Ten to 12 bodies were found Saturday, according to <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state officials. <PERSON> Chand </PERSON> said his father and uncle were aboard the ferry. He said he was waiting for the bodies so he could cremate them according to Hindu rites. The boat trip is normally used by Hindu pilgrims going across the river to worship at a shrine of Lord Shiva in <LOCATION> Deoghar </LOCATION> town. Lord Shiva is the destroyer diety in the Hindu trinity. Boat accidents are common during the annual monsoon rains when major rivers overflow their banks.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> spent much of a three-year span tucked away in his room, sleeping or sitting in a lotus position with his head enveloped in tobacco or marijuana smoke, according to a biography of the slain Beatle. An excerpt from the book, `` The Lives of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'' by journalist and biographer <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, appearing in the Aug. 15 issue of People magazine, discloses a sometimes unflattering portrait of both <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> and his second wife, <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>. The book is scheduled to be published later this month by <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Inc Between 1976 and 1979, <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> writes, <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> `` could not be more remote.'' Apart from a few hours in the morning and evening, including time spent with his son, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> is back here in his room, alone and silent.'' The author says the idolized Beatle spent most of his adult life as an anorexic, starving himself to what he perceived as perfection. The onset of the eating disorder can be traced to 1965, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> writes, `` when some fool described him in print as the ` fat Beatle.''' `` That phrase struck such a blow to his fragile ego that the wound has never healed.'' <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> rarely wore clothing, other than a pair of backless slippers, and avoided touching anyone, according to the book. The 719-page biography also details <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ono </PERSON>'s $ 5,000-a-week heroin habit in 1979. She reportedly snorted the drug. According to the book, <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> also took heroin and consumed a great deal of LSD. `` I must have taken a thousand trips,'' the book quotes <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> as saying. `` I just ate it all the time like candy.'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> spent more than six years researching the book, interviewing 1,200 friends, relatives and associates of <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, who was murdered eight years ago in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said today his country's 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> appears to be coming to a close and claimed world opinion prompted <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to drop its demand for direct talks before a cease-fire. But <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> questioned <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s sincerity in wanting peace. His first public reference to the expected end of the fighting, <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>'s comments came at the opening of an international conference of Islamic scholars and specialists in Third World issues. He said the `` gathering fortunately is taking place in days when the war that lasted eight years is apparently coming to a close. `` There is no doubt that the international public opinion put pressure on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said in his 40-minute speech. `` It is under that pressure that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was finally forced to accept a cease-fire.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> to <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> announced Sunday that both sides had agreed to a truce that is to take hold in about two weeks. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had accepted <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s compromise offer that direct talks on a lasting peace immediately follow a cease-fire. Before making the offer Saturday, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had insisted that direct talks precede a cease-fire. Speaking without a prepared text, <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> hesitated to accept the cease-fire because it wanted to dictate conditions for peace. Since the spring, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has suffered a string of battlefield defeats. `` It would be good for the international community to question their kind of approach,'' he said. `` It is this regime that should be doubted. And its true devotion to peace should be looked upon with great doubt. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> launched a major offensive against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> shortly after <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> reversed itself and accepted a year-old <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution last month. Meanwhile, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said today that three people were wounded on Sunday in three hours of Iraqi shelling across the northern border. The Iranian capital is still dressed for war, but headlines point to progress toward a cease-fire and the country's battered economy has swiftly reacted to prospects for peace. Building entrances are still sandbagged, windows are taped to prevent them from shattering in a missile explosion and yellow signs show the way to the nearest air-raid shelter. But residents in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, a city of 8 million, seem convinced these remnants from the last Iraqi missile attacks in April will disappear before long. There were no sensational headlines Sunday in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s afternoon newspapers, which came out before the developments in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> but after <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio announced <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s compromise offer. `` New Developments in <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Talks for Cease-Fire'' said the small headline in the Ettela'at newspaper. Iranians in the street did not seem surprised by news of the developments, which broke an impasse in two weeks of U.N.-mediated negotiations. There were few signs of exuberance. `` People were sure the end would come sooner or later,'' said <PERSON> Said </PERSON>, a middle-aged, English-speaking businessman. `` Iranians know very well what's going on in the world, perhaps better than many Westerners.'' Amid hopes for a post-war recovery, the Iranian riyal has in the past few weeks risen sharply against the dollar and other currencies on the black market. The dollar was unofficially quoted at 300 riyals at noon Sunday. This compared to 785 on Aug. 1, and 1,480 before <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accepted a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution on July 18. The driver of a vintage <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> said he bought his well-kept car second - hand eight years ago for 3.5 million riyals and two months ago, he was offerered 10 million for it `` Now the price is back where it was in 1981,'' he said with a grin. `` That means the war is over.''

<TEXT>
 Chinese throughout <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> today celebrated an auspicious once-in-a-century date _ 8-8-88 _ with a wave of weddings, business openings and lavish parties. Some hospitals geared up for maternity ward gridlock as women sought to bring their children into the world on the propitious day. And merchants spared no effort to use the date to promote everything from fast food to real estate, while <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> gamblers tested their luck in a special lottery with a sweetened jackpot. Cantonese-speaking Chinese, who represent the vast majority of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s 5.7 million people and have large communities in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, have long considered eight to bring good fortune. In the Cantonese dialect, the word for eight is `` baat,'' which sounds like `` faat,'' the word for prosperity. That similarity of sound makes Aug. 8, 1988, a momentous occasion for superstitious Chinese. `` Not only the Cantonese, but everyone is celebrating,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> at the Pure Mind, one of many restaurants reporting record bookings for dinner in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, where more than one-third of the 16 million people are ethnic Chinese. The big event in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> was a ceremony atop the new <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> local headquarters to mark placement of the final beam in the 1,221-foot structure, which contractors claim is the tallest building outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the fifth-tallest in the world. Dignitaries assembled on the 70th floor to split a roast pig and a keg of sake to celebrate the occasion. In <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, at least five buildings held official openings today, including the 920-foot <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Many couples figured the best way to ensure a life of marital bliss was to get married today. The <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government reported 278 couples registered to get married today, a 130 percent increase from a week earlier. Scores more tied the knot in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, where a mass ceremony called `` Wedding Of The Century'' was held at <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> Theater Restaurant. In <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Subang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and other hospitals reported nurses and doctors were asked to work overtime because of expectant mothers wanting to give birth today, even if the birth had to be induced. Malaysian doctors, speaking on condition of anonymity, said women with Caesarean sections scheduled for other days this week had asked that the procedure be done today. Businessmen, meanwhile, launched every conceivable promotion to mark the date. In <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, one real estate agent offered `` a lucky discount'' of 8,888 <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> dollars -LRB- $ 4,356.86 -RRB- on a three-story house. A <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> offered 88 children who turned 8 this month a meal as well as T-shirts sporting `` 8888.'' Several <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> hotels ran promotions tied to the date. Diners at the Loong Yuen Chinese Restaurant at the Holiday Inn Golden Mile ate for free if their total bill included four 8s. The colony's lottery also held a special drawing today with a jackpot enlarged by an additional 3,888,888 <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> dollars -LRB- nearly $ 500,000 -RRB-. Despite all the hoopla, local astrologers who consult the traditional Chinese calendar dismissed suggestions that today was the century's luckiest day. `` It is a good day, but not a special one,'' sniffed astrologer `` Rocky'' Sung Siu-kwong of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in a recent interview. Indeed, today's scheduled opening of a new light-rail mass transit system in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> was put off after a spate of test-run accidents, including one that killed an 8-year-old boy. Little luck rubbed off on the colony's free-wheeling stock exchange, where prices dropped slightly in light trading. In <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, however, the commodity exchange launched trading in cocoa futures to coincide with the date. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Yue </PERSON>, a self-described master of geomancy, palmistry, astrology and name consultant in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, cautioned that 8-8-88 may not mean prosperity for all. He noted the Cantonese pronounciation for four is `` sei,'' the same as the word that means to die. Since today's date has four eights, he advised: `` Tread with caution and contain your greed.''

 A bedroom fire in a retirement home killed one resident and sent smoke billowing through the rest of the building, injuring 17 other residents and four rescuers, officials said. `` It's a tragedy because one loss of life occurred,'' Fire Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pudney </PERSON> said after Sunday night's blaze. `` But it could have been worse.'' The fire at the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Age </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> in this <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> suburb was extinguished within 11 minutes, said <PERSON> Pudney </PERSON>, adding that the fire's cause had not been determined. The home had 23 residents. The fire began in the room of a 75-year-old man who had been warned not to smoke, said the home's owner. `` He's done this before,'' said <PERSON> Cherian </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>. `` Twice we've taken his lighter away. Flames spread to a bathroom and an adjacent hallway, but the thick black smoke caused most of the injuries. The smoke forced residents outside the building into a driving rainstorm, where they gasped for air as they stood beneath yellow tarpaulins awaiting transportation to a hospital. Frantic relatives began arriving at the home to search for loved ones. A police spokesman said as many as 30 relatives awaited news. The injured were taken to <ORGANIZATION> Plantation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bennett </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Most suffered from smoke inhalation. The rescuers _ two police officers, a firefighter and a paramedic _ also were treated for smoke inhalation.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> today for failing to establish a dialogue with moderate Palestinians and for the tough measures used against activists in the occupied territories. His statements came after a 2 -LCB- - hour meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and military officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> `` I've discussed <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s concern that there is insufficient dialogue, shall we say, between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the moderate Palestinians,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, adding he was not suggesting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> talk to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> referred to sharp disagreements with <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s handling of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists Since the uprising began Dec. 8 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, about 2,500 alleged agitators have been jailed for up to six months without trial, the homes of 84 activists have been demolished and 29 nationalists have been deported. `` We do n't think they're the way to go. We do n't agree with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. On that we've had a very frank exchange,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who was to fly to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> later today. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said that because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> agreed to file criminal charges against <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a Palestinian who on July 31 was ordered jailed for six months without trial. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> protested <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>'s detention without due process. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials claimed <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, who advocated dialogue with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials, was a senior representative of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> organization. A draft of a proposed Palestinian `` declaration of independence'' was found by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> police in his Arab Studies Center in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and leaked to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> newspapers. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official who demanded anonymity confirmed <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> disagreed on the measures used by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the occupied lands but said the subject was only a minor part of the agenda. He said the exchange last only five minutes and <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s protest was perfunctory. Speaking on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio before the meeting, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> noted he had held several meetings in recent weeks with Palestinian leaders from the occupied territories, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> during the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The uprising in the occupied lands has left 237 Palestinians and four Israelis dead. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said he was willing to hold talks with Palestinian leaders from the occupied territories, regardless of their demands, as long as they are not affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process is `` totally frozen'' and will remain so until after the Israeli and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> elections in November. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> disagreed, saying `` I do n't think its something that should wait for elections here, there or elsewhere.'' `` We are encouraging the opening of channels of communications which have gradually closed down over the last several months, and we hope that will be undertaken,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said he would welcome emergence of an indigenous <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leadership without links to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` The moment there is <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leadership which says to us, ` We are your partners for dialogue, with us you must reach an agreement,' I will say immediately, ` Let's sit around the table,''' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. In a rare display of unity, leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday spoke out against a document calling for the declaration of an independent Palestinian state headed by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> reject negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, outlawed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a terrorist organization, and oppose establishing a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the occupied lands. The origins of the declaration, details of which were published for the first time on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television Saturday, remained a mystery. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, editor of the Jerusalem-based, pro-PLO, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fajr </PERSON> daily, told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television it was `` the work of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> think tank. It was passed around to find out the reaction of the local leadership.'' <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leadership should endorse the document, because `` it would positively affect the situation.''

The <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> also reported anti-government riots in some districts of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and said some schools and universities were closed. The agency quoted Sudanese officials as saying the floods were the worst there since 1946. In its unattributed report, the Egyptian agency painted a grim picture of the situation in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. `` Public utilities in the capital continue to suffer from almost complete paralysis for the third straight day,'' the report said. <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Omdurman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> has gone off the air, the report said, and only a provincial government-owned radio station at <LOCATION> Wad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Medani </LOCATION>, 100 miles southeast of the capital, is broadcasting for a few hours daily. <PERSON> Abu-Saleh </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, the eastern cities of <LOCATION> Kassala </LOCATION> and Showak and the northern city of El-Damer were declared disaster areas because of the flooding. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s finance minister, <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nour </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Dayem </PERSON>, was quoted as saying about 1 million people were left homeless because the floods destroyed thousands of dwellings. He said 5,000 houses were washed away in the <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> area alone. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> has a population of about 23 million. <LOCATION> Kassala </LOCATION>, capital of the eastern province, is 250 miles east of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. El-Damer lies 160 miles northeast of the capital. `` Entire villages and districts have been isolated by the flooding, and rescue forces have not been able to reach them because of the high water level,'' <PERSON> Abu-Saleh </PERSON> was quoted as saying. He did not identify the affected areas. The ministers said flood waters cut telephone and telex communications and caused power failures which, in turn, disrupted public utilities. President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> ordered immediate relief for <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, which traditionally has had close ties with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Five Egyptian C-130 military transport planes flew in tents, medical supplies and food on Sunday. Another five planeloads went to <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> today. The flooding has compounded <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s economic difficulties, which include a chronic balance of payments deficit and a $ 12 billion foreign debt. For several years, the country has been suffering from food shortages, including bread, increased commodity prices and deficient public utilities. These problems frequently touched off public unrest. Last week people rioted in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> on three successive days to protest water and bread shortages and electric power cuts. Police used tear gas to disperse the rioters who had set fire to tires on the streets.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is to send a diplomat to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the first time in a year, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said today. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON>, a first secretary, will spend two to three weeks in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to `` test the water'' and will then report back.

No suspect or motive have been found in the attempted bombing, according to a statement issued by the base.

 Police today returned, with apologies, a T-shirt they confiscated from a teen-ager because it criticized military censorship in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and angered a crowd of Israelis in a bus station. <PERSON> Tamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Forman </PERSON>, 14, a daughter of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigrants, said she planned to continue wearing the white shirt emblazoned in red with `` Freedom of the Press'' in Hebrew, Arabic and English, despite the controversy it stirred. The shirt also bears a mock military censor's stamp and a picture of a soldier gagging a man, whose hands are tied. A policewoman took the shirt from Miss <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> last month after forcing her to remove it at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s central bus station when an angry crowd of 50 surrounded the girl, cursing her. Left-wing legislators said the incident underscored anti-press feeling in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that has intensified during the 8-month-old Palestinian uprising, in which 237 Arabs and four Israelis have been killed. Miss <PERSON> Forman </PERSON>, who complained to police about the incident last week, was questioned for 30 minutes today at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police headquarters. A policewoman then apologized for the confiscation and returned the shirt. `` The lady said she was sorry and gave me the shirt,'' Miss <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> said. `` I feel it's good something was done about this, and I hope this means it wo n't happen to somebody else.'' Her mother, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Forman </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, hugged her daughter as they left the station and said she was shocked `` that such a thing could happen to my daughter and in my country, the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Miss <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> said she had worn the shirt several times to school before the incident. `` I plan to wear it again,'' she added.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A tentative agreement aimed at averting a strike by 1,600 nurses at two public hospitals could lead to settlements in three strikes involving nearly 4,000 private-sector nurses, Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said. Local 790 of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> announced the tentative agreement Sunday. Ratification would prevent 1,600 nurses from striking <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>, which handles the poorest and sickest people in the city, and <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Honda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, which cares for elderly patients, and a half-dozen city clinics, including one at a jail. `` We reached this settlement on time because none of the parties wanted to add to the health care fears that have permeated this city'' since the labor disputes began last month, <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said. `` I call on all the parties in the private-sector disputes to take a lesson from the public sector here,'' the mayor said. Talks with Local 790 continued round-the-clock throughout the weekend; the settlement was reached at 4:20 a.m. Sunday. Details of the pact were not released. The public-sector division of <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> sought to reduce nurse-patient ratios and improve measures to retain and recruit nurses. Pay was not an issue with the municipal nurses, but private-sector nurses say increased pay is the main issue in their strike. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said he told his staff last week to try and settle the dispute before Tuesday's strike deadline in order to prevent adding to a labor crisis that so far involves eight private hospitals. Nine hospitals have not been struck. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> also called for an immediate resumption of bargaining in the strikes, in which no new talks have been scheduled. He said he planned to `` very actively, very aggressively'' involve himself and other city officials in the disputes. About 1,700 licensed vocational nurses and hospital workers in Local 250 of the <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> went on strike July 26 against seven hospitals. More than 2,100 registered nurses represented by the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> struck at six of those facilities on Aug. 2. On Saturday, 130 nurses represented by the <ORGANIZATION> CNA </ORGANIZATION> and an undetermined number of service workers represented by Local 250 also went on strike at <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The struck hospitals have remained open. The strike by Local 250 is mainly over health benefits and sick leave. The <ORGANIZATION> CNA </ORGANIZATION> wants an 11 percent raise for the first year and a 10 percent raise in the second year of a two-year contract. The hospitals are negotiating as a group called Affiliated Hospitals and have offered 18 percent raises over 31 months, which would cost the affected six hospitals $ 40 million. Talks with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> employees are separate from the other negotiations.

 Today's 8-8-88 and residents of Eighty Eight, the southwestern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> town 8.8 miles south of <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, have gone eight-wild. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has sent a mobile post office from <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> to help with today's once-in-a-century chance for the special post mark. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning, America'' broadcast a segment of today's show from this small farming community of 150 residents And, at 8:08 p.m., a couple from Casper, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, plans to wed.. That's 8:08 on 8-8-88 in Eighty Eight Legend has it that Eighty Eight was named by <PERSON> Dabnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunnally </PERSON>, a postmaster in the 1860s. He wanted to give the town a digital name, reached into his pocket, found 88 cents in change, and that was it. Much of the revelry began Sunday, when, in anticipation of the date, residents and visitors clogged the town's only thoroughfare to watch a parade, buy souvenirs and have a piece of a commemorative cake _ 8 feet, 8 inches long, 8.8 inches wide and 8.8 inches high. The folks in Eighty Eight, though, were not the only ones celebrating the once-in-a-century date. Throughout <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, Cantonese-speaking Chinese, who consider the number eight good luck since it sounds like the word for prosperity in their language, marked the day with weddings, business openings and lavish parties. And some hospitals geared up for maternity ward gridlock as women sought to bring their children into the world on the propitious day. It was also a special day for <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Torgerson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ferryville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, who came from a family of eight children and turned 88 years old today. In addition to her 11 children, she has 88 descendants, the family says. In <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, there was even a special commemorative menu at the Eighty Eight Market. `` I got a special 88-cent hamburger,'' said <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Russie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` Four cents tax makes 92, so there's 8 cents change. Good.'' Ms. <PERSON> Russie </PERSON>, 45, was among Sunday's early arrivals. She drove up to the front steps of the market in her Oldsmobile. A <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 88, of course. Her license plate read `` ANY 88.'' `` I'm an 88 freak,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Russie </PERSON>, a custodian at <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. She had to buy a new set of tires to make the 500-mile trip, but, `` when I heard there was a town called Eighty Eight, I had to come here,'' she said. The most talked-about part of the celebration was tonight's marriage of <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Accardo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhlbeier </PERSON> In its broadcast this morning from Eighty-Eight, `` Good Morning, America'' interviewed eight people, including <PERSON> Accardo </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Muhlbeier </PERSON>. `` We're here because we wanted to get married in Eighty Eight, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, on 8-8 of'88 at 8:08 p.m. ... on the eighth step of the <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Muhlbeier </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Accardo </PERSON> acknowledged he would have no excuse for forgetting his wedding anniversary. The couple had not yet set a date when they learned of the town located about 40 miles east of Bowling Green from a television news report, and decided it would be fun to tie the knot there on 8-8-88. The couple tried to write the mayor of Eighty Eight, soon learning there was n't one, <PERSON> Accardo </PERSON> said. They heard instead from <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, the postmistress. Plans for an outdoor wedding, performed by a county magistrate, soon took shape. `` It's fun. We wo n't ever have this happen again,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, who this year has received numerous requests from around the world for the postmark.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the nation's governors today that in his two terms in the White House he had kept his promise to `` get the federal government off the backs of the states.'' Speaking to the 80th annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the president said, `` In the last 7 -LCB- years, we have broken the federal government of its compulsion to control every breath the states take.'' In his text, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never mentioned the presidential contest between his vice president, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was not scheduled to appear at the governors conference until the closing session on Tuesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> will nominate him for president next week. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> portrayed himself as a former governor who reversed a trend toward federal domination of the states. `` Too often in the past, when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> listened to the states, it heard only what it wanted to hear,'' he said. `` Today, things are different. When governors talk, we not only listen, but we hear.'' The president said his administration had worked closely with governors to come up with assistance for farmers hurt by the widespread drought. `` You have advised,'' he said. `` We have responded. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s farmers are getting help. `` From education to transportation to helping <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poor and homeless, you have led,'' he said. `` While <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been caught up in partisan intrigue, you've gone out and done the job.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cited welfare reform as an area in which `` the states will find the way truly to help welfare families become independent and productive and to put them on the ladder of opportunity.'' He contrasted state actions with what he called `` program after program'' enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to get people off welfare. `` All of those programs have had one thing in common,'' he said of the federal efforts. `` They've failed.'' The governors have fought <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s effort to shift responsibility for welfare to the states. They argued that he was giving them the problem without shifting the funds needed to deal with it. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recalled his days as governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> when `` I was sitting where you're sitting, and I was talking about the need to get the federal government off the backs of the states. ... `` I hope that history will record that this former governor went on to practice what he'd preached and to fight the use of federal dollars first as bait, then as a club, and to return power and responsibility to the states where they belong.'' Earlier, the chairman of the governors association predicted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor, Democrat or Republican, will turn more federal power over to the states. `` I think both candidates understand there is a return of authority and responsibility necessary to go back to the states,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, the Republican governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, said on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' program. `` If we're going to be effective and efficient in health care and education, some of the handcuffing of federal legislation has to be removed,'' said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who appeared in the interview with incoming association chairman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. By the time the governors hold their winter meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1989, a new president will be in the White House. Before the meeting began, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, a strong <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporter, and <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, agreed privately to lobby their colleagues to steer clear of presidential politics during the conference. Throughout <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term and well into his second, the governors were often at odds with the president over budget priorities, with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> resisting their demands that he cut his plans for increases in defense spending and that he consider a tax increase as a means of reducing the budget deficit. They also clashed over the president's effort to transfer responsibility for many domestic programs to the states. Even Democratic governors admitted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> won that battle. `` Here we are, 7 -LCB- years later, not too far from perhaps where the president first thought we ought to be,'' said Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> today rescheduled the crucial hot-fire test of shuttle Discovery's engines for Wednesday morning after replacing the defective valve-sensor combination that caused a last-second scrub last week. The test, in which all three of the shuttle's engines are fired, was set for 7:30 a.m. EDT. Technicians will begin the countdown for the test at 6:10 p.m. Tuesday. The shuttle's engines were to have been tested last Thursday, but the sensor reported that a one-inch valve which circulates coolant before firing had not closed to where it was supposed to be. The engines' onboard computer, sensing a malfunction, aborted the test before ignition. Technicians spent the weekend swapping out the mechanism. Today, the blast doors that protect the shuttle during the firing were being installed and scaffolding removed. The engines will be fired for 22 seconds with the shuttle bolted firmly to the pad. The ship's two solid fuel booster rockets will not be ignited. The firing tests not only the engines, but the entire countdown process, the shuttle system and launch teams. It is a requirement since no shuttle has flown in the more than 2 -LCB- years since the Challenger explosion. Dicovery is being treated as if it were an untried new ship. No date has been set for Discovery's launch with five astronauts on board, but five postponements of the hot-fire test to date have made it all but certain that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> ca n't meet a late September target. The sensor, which signals the valve's open-closed position to the ship's onboard computer, gave a wrong reading last Thursday, and the flight readiness firing test was aborted. Engineers determined that the valve was in the proper position but decided to replace both because they are in the same subassembly. That work was finished by midnight Saturday; crews spent Sunday reconnecting lines and hoses and testing everything for leaks.

<HEAD>Vincennes Rescues Five Iranian Fishermen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The USS Vincennes, the cruiser that mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner last month, rescued five Iranian fishermen over the weekend who apparently had been drifting in a dinghy for more than a week, defense officials said today. The officials, who asked not to be identified, said the guided-missile cruiser was on a routine patrol in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, just below the entrance to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> at the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, when it spotted the five fishermen in a small dinghy on Sunday. The men were quickly taken aboard and treated for what was described as minor injuries, primarily dehydration and hypothermia, the officials added. `` The five identified themselves as fishermen whose boat sank while working in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>,'' said one source. `` They had apparently been adrift for several days, possibly up to eight days.'' The sources said the men were still aboard the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> today, awaiting arranfements to be made for a return to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> took up patrol duties just outside the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> not long after it accidently shot down an Iranian Air Bus on July 3, killing all 290 aboard. The guided-missile cruiser had just emerged from a battle with Iranian gunboats when its radar operators detected what crew members thought was an Iranian F-14 fighter. According to a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report which has not been released publicly, the stress of first-time combat contributed to crew errors in tracking and targeting the ill-fated airliner.

 A racing boat apparently snagged debris during a race before it flew out of control into a crowd of spectators along the <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, injuring 23, authorities said. The 1,100-pound, 16-foot boat driven by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> suddenly became airborne, veered sharply to the right and slammed into the crowd near Three Rivers Stadium during Sunday's 11th annual Three Rivers Regatta, which drew 100,000 people. Eleven of the injured were children. This morning, hospitals treating the victims reported three people still in critical condition. One person originally counted among the race accident victims was injured separately while diving in the river, said a spokeswoman for one of the five hospitals that treated the injured. Police spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizza </PERSON> said the injuries included open fractures, abrasions and severe blunt injuries to the chest, stomach and head. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peterborough </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, suffered minor injuries and shock, said the race medical director, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Carras </PERSON>. The accident occurred in choppy water during the seventh lap of the 50-lap Champion Spark Plug Grand Prix race. The 15-boat race, sponsored by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Formula One <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was the highlight of the regatta. Spectators lining the 1.2-mile course said the accident happened so quickly they did n't immediately figure out what had happened. `` I was watching the lead boats going around, and I looked up and saw -LRB- Wood's boat -RRB- headed right at us about 50 feet out,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Butler </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` The front end lifted and it started coming toward us,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Surovchak </PERSON>, 21, of suburban <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. `` We had about 10 or 15 seconds to get out of the way, but some of the people did n't realize what was going on and they got hit. <PERSON> Surovchak </PERSON> was not hurt, but his girlfriend, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Saver </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, who had been standing beside him, was hospitalized in serious condition at Allegheny General. The race was restarted two hours later, after paramedics transported the injured from <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> to five hospitals. The rest of the race was limited to 20 laps. Race officials said <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s propeller apparently snagged some debris and came off, causing the boat to lose control and spin wildly into the crowd at a 90-degree angle. The boat landed on its side with the engine toward the spectators. Another driver in the race, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Provich </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Ambridge </LOCATION>, said authorities recovered a railroad tie from the river with propeller marks on it. He speculated that <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>' boat hit the railroad tie. Police Lt. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> described the wood as `` a rather large log.'' `` It was just one of the pieces of debris that was pulled from the river in that vicinity,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. `` At this point the investigation is very broad and we're looking into all aspects.'' Police said they did n't know how long it would take detectives and officials of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to complete the investigation. Witnesses said the boat's engines were off when it hit the riverbank at about 40 mph. But race officials said they did not know the boat's speed. Formula One boats, which have eight - and six-cylinder engines and weigh up to 1,000 pounds, are the fastest outboard powered race boats Drivers can reach more than 140 mph on straightaways and 90 mph on turns.

 Thousands of young people marched through <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s capital today chanting anti-government slogans and singing the national anthem, diplomats said. Students had called for a nationwide general strike. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported 30,000 people took part in protests in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and more than 10,000 students, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and others staged demonstrations in <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s second largest city. No violence was reported in what may have been the largest protest in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> since democracy was overthrown 26 years ago. `` You could n't see the end of -LRB- the crowd -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Georgina </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a 22-year-old British student who today returned to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. She said she saw `` solid flanks'' of unarmed demonstrators clenching their fists, cheering and clapping their hands as they marched along a main street in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. `` We're going for democracy. We're fighting for democracy,'' she quoted one student as saying. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said some Burmese students told her, `` We do n't want to change the government. We want a socialist government. We hate the president. He's an evil man.'' Many shops were closed and there were reports that some workers stayed away from their factory jobs, but other stores were open for business, said Western and Asian diplomats reached by telephone in the capital, <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. The extent of the strike was not immediately clear. The demonstrators, most of them wearing handkerchiefs around their faces to avoid identification, walked in orderly fashion in the downtown area and there was no confrontation with troops patrolling the city, the diplomats said. They said they did not know whether protests took place in other parts of the city or the surrounding area. Students have been at the forefront of protests against the nation's new hard-line leader, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>. They blame him for ordering the suppression of demonstrations in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> last March and June in which, by unofficial count, more than 100 people were killed. Last month, the former army general was named president of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and chairman of its ruling party. The Chinese news agency <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> quoted official newspapers as saying demonstrations broke out Saturday in <LOCATION> Pegu </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yenangyang </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Thanatpin </LOCATION>, with police opening fire to disperse crowds. There were also unconfirmed reports reaching <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> that students and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks held weekend demonstrations in <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s second largest city. Authorities issued orders banning all public gatherings, speech-making, marches and agitation in <LOCATION> Pegu </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yenangyang </PERSON> and Thanatpin. Martial law was clamped on <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, the capital, on Wednesday after demonstrators demanded <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s ouster. The official <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said Sunday that authorities investigating recent disturbances found a list of those `` who pulled the strings from behind-the-scenes'' and released 80 people from Insein prison. It gave no further details of the alleged ringleaders pinpointed by the authorities. The 80 said to have been released _ 11 students, 66 civilians and three civil servants _ appeared to be among 149 people the government said it arrested in connection with last week's demonstrations Before the demonstrations, authorities arrested a leading government critic, former Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, and several other people, including <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent Sein Win.

<HEAD>Oregon Fire Grows Overnight, Authorities Considering Evacuations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A fast-moving forest fire in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> grew by more than half overnight to 11,000 acres, while cooler temperatures and higher humidity helped firefighters in Yellowstone National Park halt the spread of wildfires there. Authorities were considering whether to evacuate a popular tourist area 25 miles southeast of Bend, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, because of the fire in <ORGANIZATION> Deschutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. The fire continued to burn out of control this morning despite the efforts of more than 1,000 firefighters. The <PERSON> Paulina </PERSON> fire, pushed by winds and low humidity, consumed 4,000 acres of mostly dead lodgepole pine overnight, officials said. <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said it was possible the fire could reach the rim of Newberry Crater today. `` If this should happen, spot fires might start within the crater near <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Paulina </PERSON> lakes,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` There's no reason to panic. The fire is still a ways away.'' Smoke from the human-caused blaze could be seen as far away as <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` We've had columns -LRB- of smoke -RRB- up to three miles high,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. At <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, some 1,000 firefighters halted the movement of a 19,600-acre blaze toward a religious settlement. `` The fires have slowed down,'' park spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> said this morning. `` I know we did not see significant increase in acreage -LRB- overnight -RRB-, and all the fires continue to be contained within the park boundaries.'' Much of the smoke that has billowed from the fires since late June has begun to lift, unveiling acres and acres of green trees that somehow managed to survive flames, she said. While some 180,000 acres of the 2.2 million-acre park have been affected by the fires, <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> said once all the smoke clears, the stands of untouched trees will reduce the number of acres actually charred. On the Fan fire burning in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s northwestern corner, firefighters managed to stop the northern movement of the fire and keep it out of southern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> property owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> and Triumphant. Church officials have threatened to sue the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> if the blaze, which has stalled for several days at about a quarter-mile from the Yellowstone border, crosses onto their land. Last week, week church members stood before the flames and prayed in an attempt to redirect the fire. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, crews continued to mop up the hot spots inside the fire line on the 1,500-acre Spring Canyon II fire. `` We're hoping the weather will stay cool and humidity will stay up for the next few days,'' spokeman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornell </PERSON> said. Firefighters contained the blaze, which is burning in the <ORGANIZATION> Targhee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> near the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> border, Saturday evening. Officials said they hope to have the fire under control by tonight.

<TEXT>
 Scientists' first dives to the bottom of <LOCATION> Crater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> turned up no signs of expected hot springs that might be evidence of ancient volcanic activity, but their submarine ride gave them a new outlook. `` I think so far we have seen similar things, but in much greater detail than last year,'' when a robot submarine explored the lake, <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> oceanographer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dymond </PERSON> said Sunday, describing the first two dives. `` We have n't found any actual thermal springs,'' said <PERSON> Dymond </PERSON>, who made the first manned dive to the bottom of the nation's deepest lake Friday The deepest point in the lake is 1,932 feet. <PERSON> Dymond </PERSON> and fellow <ORGANIZATION> OSU </ORGANIZATION> oceanographer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> are using a one-man submersible called Deep Rover to search the lake for hot springs that may be the remnants of volcanic activity that formed the lake. <PERSON> Dymond </PERSON> said he saw what he interpreted as evidence of old hot springs: deposits of iron and manganese and rock formations with colored stains on holes or cracks. The research could affect efforts by <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to develop hydrothermal energy nearby, outside the boundary of Crater Lake National Park. If the lake is found to have significant geothermal features, development in the neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Winema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> could be prohibited. The two men are in the second year of a three-year effort financed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to learn why the lake's water is so clear, with visibility measured to depths of 85 to 115 feet. <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>, who made his first dive Saturday, said that at a depth of 1,200 feet blue light was still visible from above. Their work is part of a larger 10-year study started after scientists in the 1970s noticed a significant reduction in the lake's clarity. Recent measurements have shown the clarity returning to levels last measured in the 1930s. <PERSON> Dymond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> said nothing they have found so far could settle the question of whether drilling for hydrothermal energy more than seven miles away would affect the lake. <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFleur </PERSON> said if hot springs do exist, they would n't be affected by the drilling. Crater Lake was formed after rain and melted snow filled a crater, called a caldera, formed when the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mazama </LOCATION> volcano erupted nearly 7,000 years ago and then collapsed into what had been a chamber filled with molten rock. <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dymond </PERSON> said sonar echos off unexpectedly craggy features on the bottom of the lake made precise navigation difficult. Precise navigation is important. Last year, while using the remote-controlled submersible, scientists found what looked like a vent oozing a milky fluid. However, they were never able to relocate it to take a temperature reading or a fluid sample.

However, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said further negotiations are necessary to determine a timetable for withdrawal of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and the granting of independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. `` This is the first step of a very long, arduous road to peace,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told a news conference. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also were expected to issue statements today following last week's fifth round of U.S.-mediated peace talks. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> planned to pull its estimated 3,000 troops out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by Sept. 1. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, along with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, backs the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebel movement in its 13-year-old fight against the Angolan government. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> is backed by an estimated 50,000 Cuban troops. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has an estimated 50,000 troops in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said withdrawal would begin Nov. 1. But he said the countries involved must first agree on a single date for the total withdrawal of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The parties plan a sixth round of talks the week of Aug. 22 to try to resolve the matter. The site of the talks was not announced. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has said it will grant <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> independence next June 1 if all Cuban forces have left <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by that date. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, however, has offered in previous talks to withdraw over four years. Today's announcement suggested the two sides were closer to agreeing on a mutual date than at any time previously. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> had invited <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to discuss Namibian independence. `` It's imperative that the secretary general visit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> urgently,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. The peace talks began in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in May. In the fifth round, held last week in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, negotiators reportedly agreed on a cease-fire between South African and Cuban-Angolan forces as well as a mutual pullback of troops. Details of the agreement were withheld. The parties have reached no public agreement on the role of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main black group fighting white rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has called for the dismantling of seven guerrilla camps it says are operated in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s mandate over <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> was terminated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1966, but it has retained control over the territory in defiance of several <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions. The state-run South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in a commentary today, described the current diplomatic climate as `` one that would hardly have been conceivable just a few months ago.'' However, it said major problems remained unresolved in regard to implementation of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan for elections in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. `` The very substantial costs associated with the plan have caught some of the parties unawares,'' the report said. `` Apart from the $ 600 million needed for organizing U.N.-sponsored elections, guarantees will have to be found for replacing the $ 120 million -LRB- in -RRB- annual economic aid ... that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has borne until now.''

 Graffito at a Lower East Side park entrance reads `` Go Home Yuppie Scum.'' But neighbors say reasons for a riot that pitted hundreds against police reach beyond tensions created by gentrification and include drug-dealing and homelessness. Thirty-eight people, including seven police officers, were slightly injured in confrontations early Sunday at <LOCATION> Tompkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>; nine were arrested on riot, assault and disorderly conduct charges, authorities said. Six brutality complaints were filed against police, who were wearing riot gear and were bolstered by mounted officers and helicopters. `` I hope you saw what ... was going on because we did n't start this,'' said Police Capt. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>. `` We did everything in our power not to provoke an incident. They did n't charge the crowd until the bricks and bottles started flying.'' The riot started as police tried to enforce a 1 a.m. curfew at the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> park. Some residents had asked that police do so, saying the park is a nighttime hangout for drug dealers, rowdy drunks, homeless people and so-called punk rockers, who dress in black leather and spike their hair. At a City Hall news conference this morning, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> blamed Sunday's riot both on tempers that flared in the heat and on `` provocateurs.'' On Sunday, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said the curfew at <LOCATION> Tompkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> would be suspended for the duration of the current heat wave. Today, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said the city will enforce a curfew at two city parks _ <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Stuyvesant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> _ where he said residents favor 11 p.m. closings. Neither <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> nor Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who appeared with <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, said they could conclude whether police used undue force. Citizens' complaints about extreme use of force will be investigated, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. Aides to <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> handed out photocopies of flyers said to have been distributed by demonstrators. One warned landlords near <LOCATION> Tompkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> that if the curfew were enforced `` our organization will destroy your homes''; another was bordered with drawings of guns and explosives. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> called them the work of `` provocateurs,'' and <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> suggested they were drawn up by `` professional demonstrators.'' Protesters, bystanders and reporters and photographers complained of random attacks by police with billy clubs. Police complained they were pelted with rocks, bottles and sticks. Firecrackers exploded and at least one fire was set. Estimates of the crowd ranged from around 100 to the Police Department's official estimate of more than 700. The police force started at about 100 and swelled to 450. `` Police were calling people scum, twirling their nightsticks. And the kids were inciting them, too, but they were n't throwing bottles or anything,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, 26, who lives in the neighborhood also known as the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>. The riot started as police attempted to enforce a 1 a.m. curfew that applies to all city parks but is rarely enforced. Police said residents had complained that they were having trouble sleeping because of noise from the park. `` It's noisy, there's rampant drug dealing, drug use, all night revelry,'' said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarbrough </PERSON>, 41, who lives nearby. `` And the place looks like a dump.'' `` It makes it difficult for people to sleep,'' said <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazel </PERSON>, 38. `` I've heard lots of complaints from old-timers.'' Some park habitues, however, saw the police effort as part of a vague conspiracy of developers and city officials who want to rid the area the poor, punk-rockers and squatters, and make it more attractive to affluent whites. `` It's being totally gentrified, taken over by the upper-middle-white-rich class,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Huckelberry </PERSON>, 18, a squatter in a nearby abandoned building. `` That's yuppie-bashing,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, who attributed the clash to hot weather and frustrated police who panicked. `` You'll talk to 50 people and get 50 explanations,'' she said. `` But the fact is nothing's happening.'' The decision to enforce the curfew was made July 11, and an informal coalition of residents, homeless people, punk rockers and self-styled revolutionaries held at least two protests during the past month. Police cleared the park but allowed the homeless to sleep in one corner. On Saturday evening, anticipating a large demonstration, police turned out in force. At 11:15, about 250 demonstrators marched around the park, with police standing by while firecrackers were thrown, <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> said. As the demonstration continued, blocking traffic, officers were hit with flying debris, he said. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> ordered officers on foot to form a phalanx, led by mounted officers, which charged the crowd at about 1 a.m. `` The crowd went nuts,'' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said. `` Horses were charging in a sense and then bottles started flying. People started getting hit by billy clubs. I ran across the street. I was really afraid of getting trampled.'' The crowd was dispersed, but bottle - and rock-throwing skirmishes continued until dawn at several places around the park `` An entire neighborhood was terrorized,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Breslau </PERSON>, who has lived a half block from the park for the past eight years. `` There was no time for ` What? Where? Excuse me, what's your badge number?' It was a riot.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized the Democrats' platform as `` a document of deceit'' today and suggested there still may be a chance that he and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will appear together at the Republican National Convention next week Initial plans called for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to leave <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returns next Tuesday. However, the vice president told reporters on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> II that he would view such a joint appearance as a plus for his campaign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, trying to put his stamp on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform, flew to the Republicans' convention city today to call for `` a statement of solutions'' that he said would cotrast with the invisible policies of rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He's the stealth candidate,'' the vice president said in prepared remarks. `` For while he ca n't decide about the stealth bomber, he favors instead stealth policies _ they can be neither seen nor heard.'' `` His campaign jets from place to place, but no issues show up on the radar screen.'' Besides testifying before the platform committee, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was also to tour the Superdome, where he will be formally nominated next week as his party's presidential candidate. `` Their nominee spoke for 50 minutes in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and failed to mention the most important issue of our time: how to make the world a safer place,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We need to make this campaign a plan for the future, a statement of solutions, not an exercise in evasion,'' he said. `` We should make our principles and our policies crystal clear to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ran through a litany of positions he had espoused during his campaign, suggesting their inclusion in the platform. These ranged from tax credits for child care to a ban on offshore dumping, a reduction in the capital gains tax and imposition of the death penalty for drug kingpins. `` If we want to stop our kids from putting drugs in their veins, they must first have good ideas in their heads and moral character in their hearts,'' he said. On Sunday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke with reporters on the grounds of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, after attending services with 22 members of his family: his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>; his 87-year-old mother, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>; his five adult children, their spouses and his 10 grandchildren The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> clan, which occupied the two front pews of the small oceanfront church, later posed for family photographs outside and taped television commercials for the fall campaign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denied accusations from the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign that he was shying away from debates. `` Not only do I want debates, but I have to because I've got to get him to stand by his record,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We've got to spell these differences out and debates are a good way to do it,'' he said But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was vague on when _ and how often _ he would be willing to debate <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` There'll be more than one debate, but how many ... has not been sorted out yet,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was only making a display of bravado for the television cameras and should agree to debate Sept. 14 in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, the first of three dates set by a bipartisan commission. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign officials have criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for refusing to commit himself to the schedule of debates set by the advisory commission. `` It's time to dock the motorboat in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> and launch the debate in <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said Sunday. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s designated campaign chairman, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might further distance himself from positions embraced by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration once he is formally nominated. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who is resigning his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post next week, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already has started to develop his `` own individual persona.'' `` He will be seen in an entirely different light once he is his party's nominee, a bit more free to speak out, speak his own mind, and speak out on issues distinct and different from the administration,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said he did not view <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign as troubled _ despite low ratings in recent public opinion polls. `` But I would agree there are a large number of unfavorables out there,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. He suggested the gap corresponded to the `` disapproval rating of the administration, of the president'' and that it would narrow as the election approaches.

<HEAD>Team Begins Unloading Toxic Waste From Syrian Ship</HEAD>

 Experts began work Monday to unload from a Syrian ship 12,000 drums of a toxic substance that shippers have been trying to dispose of for more than a year. Several rusty, leaking drums from the freighter Zanoobia were being put into larger containers while experts began tests on the waste, said <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Francese </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION> port. Unloading the drums will take from two to three months, he said. The Zanoobia brought the waste back to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> two months ago after foreign countries refused to accept it. The Italian state-controlled company <ORGANIZATION> Castalia </ORGANIZATION>, which won a $ 6 million contract to dispose of the waste, did not make public the final destination of the unidentified toxic material, although port sources said the material may be sent abroad to be incinerated. The waste, produced by Italian firms, was returned to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> after unsuccessful attempts to dump it in <LOCATION> Djibouti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>.

 Tropical storm <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON>, the second named storm of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season, hugged the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast today, forcing evacuations from oil rigs in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, while the season's first tropical storm fizzled out near the Canadian coast. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> was upgraded today from a tropical depression after its winds strengthened, reaching close to 45 mph with gusts up to 55 mph. The storm strengthened as it drifted closer to the warm waters of the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Oil companies evacuated more than 2,000 workers from oil rigs in southern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and the Gulf. The tropical storm had a center near latitude 29.5 north and longitude 89.3 west. It was drifting southeastward at less than 5 mph, and its movement was expected to be slow and erratic through Tuesday. The storm's center was about 50 miles southeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` There is some likelihood it could strengthen,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> of the National Hurricane Center in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` It's not drifting inland, it's drifting away from land, but very slowly.'' <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said the immediate danger from <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> was to shipping and oil rigs along the Gulf coast. People on the coast, he said, should watch for tides of up to three feet above normal. Tropical storm warnings were in effect from <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and small craft from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> O'Connor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, eastward to <LOCATION> Appalachicola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, should remain in port, the center said. `` Right now we're advising people to listen to their radios and watch television,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Valence </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, about 40 miles south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` It's highly unusual for depressions to form over land. Most of the time they get their start way out in the middle of the ocean,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` We do n't have a lot of experience with systems that form this way.'' A tropical weather system becomes a named storm when its winds hit 39 mph, and a hurricane when wind velocity reaches 74 mph. The storm chiefly affected those out on oil rigs in the Gulf, the weather service said. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifa </PERSON> said about 2,000 workers were being evacuated early today. All employees at facilities at <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leesville </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Plaquemines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> were evacuated by boat and helicopter, while non-essential personnel were removed from a facility at <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lifa </PERSON> said the storm became more threatening as it neared the gulf. `` News reports -LRB- over the weekend -RRB- were that the center was partially onshore and partially offshore, so we did n't have high winds to worry about,'' <PERSON> Lifa </PERSON> said. `` The concern is that the more it gets into the gulf, the more winds pick up. It is something we are very concerned about.'' <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Hebert </PERSON> said an unknown number of workers were taken off <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> rigs in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> today. Coast Guard Petty Officer First Class <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has not carried out any evacuations, but the storm's winds buffeted helicopters and created choppy seas for its ships The storm did n't appear to affect Republicans gathering in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> for their national convention next week; about 2 percent, or 105, of the delegates have arrived to serve on various pre-convention panels and committees, said <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thumma </PERSON>, co-director of media operations for the convention. `` Better this week than next week,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, the convention manager. The storm was unlikely to have any effect on today's visit by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who landed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> this morning for an appearance at <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform sessions, said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also planned a stop at the Superdome, site of the convention. `` Right now <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> is mostly getting the weaker western side of the storm. The folks that have been getting the worst of it are those south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>,'' said meteorologist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Koziara </PERSON>. Meanwhile <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON>, the season's first named storm, fizzled out today off the Canadian coast, <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said. `` It's lost its tropical characteristics,'' he said. `` Now it's just a storm. The center will no longer issue bulletins on it, he said. Shortly after noon Sunday, the forecasters had issued a tropical storm warning for <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s coast from <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Eastport </LOCATION>, but they canceled it less than six hours later. The storm was most likely to make landfall at <LOCATION> Yarmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Eddy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, forecasters said. Typically, there are 10 named storms during the six-month hurricane season, which begins June 1. Last year, there were only three hurricanes and four tropical storms in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew to the Republican' convention city a week early today to put his stamp on a party platform he said would be a sharp contrast to the Democrats' `` exercise in evasion Aboard Air Force II, on his way to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> from his <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also suggested there still may be a chance that he and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will appear together at the Republican National Convention next week. Previously announced plans called for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to leave <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returns next Tuesday. However, the vice president told reporters that he would view such a joint appearance as a plus for his campaign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` unexperienced'' and therefore a risky bet as president in remarks Sunday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign countered that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lengthy government `` resume did n't help him when it mattered.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> today to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, declaring, `` While <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been caught up in partisan intrigue, you've gone out and done the job.'' In his remarks prepared for delivery to the governors, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never mentioned the presidential campaign. He said that during his two terms in the White House he had kept his promise to `` get the federal government off the backs of the states.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in remarks prepared for his unusual appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today, called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` the stealth candidate.'' `` For while he ca n't decide about the stealth bomber, he favors instead stealth policies _ they can be neither seen nor heard. His campaign jets from place to place, but no issues show up on the radar screen.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the Democratic platform a `` document of deceit'' and urged <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> drafters to be more specific. `` We need to make this campaign a plan for the future, a statement of solutions, not an exercise in evasion,'' he said. `` We should make our principles and our policies crystal clear to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also was to tour the Superdome where he will be nominated next week. The GOP platform, free of controversy within the party, will highlight differences with the Democrats. `` I think the country is entitled to know the specifics,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Sunday after going to church near his home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` The governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> says he is a liberal, says he is a card-carrying member of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, and that did n't come out of the convention.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> even added new heat to his attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' foreign policy experience. `` We ca n't risk the peace and national security of this country on someone as unexperienced as the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee-to-be said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> responded by saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supported arms sales to the Iranians in the Iran-Contra affair. `` The vice president's resume did n't help him when it mattered,'' she said. `` He sat silently by while the administration peddled arms to the Ayatollah.'' Presidential politics was the topic in private discussions at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> meeting, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was to speak on Tuesday. But the chief executives agreed to avoid public partisanship. Republican Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, a vigorous <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> critic, promised Sunday to keep the campaign out of the meeting. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, just returned from a three-day campaign swing, needled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for not accepting a debate plan put forth by the two political parties. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee-to-be said the question was not whether to debate, but when and who will sponsor the confrontations that have become a staple of presidential campaigns. `` There'll be more than one debate, but how many ... has not been sorted out yet,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Not only do I want debates, but I have to because I've got to get him to stand by his record.'' The Democratic campaign is ready to talk debate specifics, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said those conversations can not begin until he formally becomes the Republican nominee at next week's convention. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` is talking tough to the cameras but is refusing to meet <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a face-to-face debate,'' <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said. `` If <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to debate foreign policy, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is ready.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with a unified party behind him but trailing badly in the polls, moved today to take the spotlight for the next two weeks, coming to the Republicans' convention city seven days before the opening gavel to talk to the platform committee.

 Astronomers have discovered a galaxy 15 billion light years from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, one of the most distant galaxies ever seen, it was announced today by the <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telescope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The galaxy, named 4C41 .17, was discovered by scientists using a new search strategy they developed It was located because of the enormous power and peculiar spectrum of its radio emissions. The galaxy is more than 90 percent of the distance to the visible limits of the universe, the announcement said. The discovery was made by <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, a graduate student at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miley </PERSON>, professor of astronomy at <ORGANIZATION> Leiden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, who was stationed at the telescope science institute in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. They made their observations with <PERSON> Wil </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Breugel </PERSON>, an astronomer at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION>. Extremely distant galaxies are of great interest to astronomers. Because light from them takes billions of years to reach the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, remote galaxies can be used to provide data about the early stages of the universe. The record distance of the new galaxy means it is being seen only about a few billion years after the Big Bang, which scientists believe marked the beginning of the observable universe. The announcement was made in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Ship in Plane Shootdown Saves Stranded Iranian Fishermen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cruiser that mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner last month rescued five Iranian fishermen who had been adrift at sea for more than a week, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The USS Vincennes spotted the five men drifting in a small dinghy around 9 p.m. EDT Sunday in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. At the time, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was on a routine patrol in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> just below the entrance to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> at the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> added. `` Their fishing boat had reportedly sunk eight days before and they were afloat in a small dinghy,'' the spokesman said. `` The fishermen were dehydrated and suffered from hypothermia and body rash. The USS Vincennes administered emergency medical care and is currently holding them on board until arrangements can be made for their safe return.'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said the five men had in their possession `` a ship's registration that provided certain information about the fishing vessel and crew. The spokesman declined to predict when the men would depart, saying, `` Their return is being handled through diplomatic channels.'' The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> took up patrol duties just outside the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> not long after it accidently shot down an Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> on July 3, killing all 290 aboard. The guided-missile cruiser had just emerged from a battle with Iranian gunboats when its radar operators detected what they thought was an Iranian F-14 fighter. According to a still-secret <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report, the stress of first-time combat contributed to crew errors in tracking and targeting the airliner.

<HEAD>Thousands of Vagrants Warned or Arrested in Byelorussia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> have arrested or given official warnings for vagrancy to more than 40,000 people in the past four years, a newspaper report said. The report in Saturday's <LOCATION> Sovietskaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>, received Monday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said more than half of the people arrested for vagrancy had held jobs but either were fired or quit voluntarily when they started wandering. The newspaper added that many others had lost families and homes while imprisoned and are faced with a suspicious society that does not want to give them a second chance. `` Being isolated from society, many of them lose their families, their residence permits, homes, and when they return work collectives often do not wish to accept them and recognize them as first-class citizens,'' the report said. Soviet media have begun paying more attention to social problems such as homelessness and vagrancy in the more open atmosphere created by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost. The numbers cited by <LOCATION> Sovietskaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> _ 8,000 arrests and 35,000 warnings _ were surprisingly large for the republic of 10 million people. There was no indication how they might compare with figures in other areas of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> guarantees a job and a place to live for all of its citizens, and proclaims that as one of the benefits of the Soviet system. The newspaper said many of the vagrants turn to theft of government or personal property. More than 80 percent of the vagrants are men, the newspaper said. Three - quarters of the men and half of the women are under 30 Half have a high school education, but every sixth vagrant has specialized high school or technical training, it said.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, trying to put his stamp on the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> platform, told drafters today it should include `` a statement of solutions'' in contrast to what he said were the invisible policies of rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He's the stealth candidate,'' the vice president said in prepared remarks. `` For while he ca n't decide about the stealth bomber, he favors instead stealth policies _ they can be neither seen nor heard.'' `` His campaign jets from place to place, but no issues show up on the radar screen.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the platform committee, `` We need to make this campaign a plan for the future, a statement of solutions, not an exercise in evasion. We should make our principles and our policies crystal clear to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' He listed positions he had espoused during his campaign and suggested they be included in the platform. These ranged from tax credits for child care to a ban on offshore dumping, a reduction in the capital gains tax and the death penalty for drug kingpins. Before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s arrival, the platform committee heard testimony from witnesses including <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> who urged the party to renew its pledge of support for the Nicaraguan rebels. Other witnesses, including anti-ERA activist <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlafly </PERSON> and the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, lined up today to press their views on the committee, but the spotlight was on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the man who will carry the party's standard in the election. `` We're just very excited by the fact that he is coming to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and appear before -LRB- us -RRB-,'' <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, chairwoman of the platform committee, said Sunday. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, a co-chairman of the panel, told reporters they expect there will be no minority planks in the 1988 platform, continuing a pattern established in 1980 and 1984. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> traveled here from his summer home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, to make an unusual personal appeal to the platform writers, meeting a week in advance of the Republican National Convention. Today, <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> told the committee the rebels could revive their dispersed army of 17,000 and bring down the Sandinista government within a year `` if we receive the proper support.'' He said afterward the rebels need $ 100 million in new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. He told reporters <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, an adamant opponent of Contra aid, `` does n't understand the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> apparently. He does n't understand the threat they represent.'' Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, one of the crafters of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, told a platform panel subcommittee on the economy, `` If the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people knew the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> record clearly, he would not be elected.'' He urged adoption of a four-point plan that includes allowing Social Security recipients to work without penalty, providing child-care dividends, lowering the capital gains tax and giving tax breaks to families with college-bound children. Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> told a family subcommittee that the Democratic plan for child care `` would throw money from the top down, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureaucratic approach.'' He urged adoption of a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> proposal for child care tax credits, which would be `` putting back money in the pockets of the American family.'' <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, co-chairman of the platform committee, said in an interview, `` Generally speaking, I sense we're not likely to revisit in great detail some of the debates we had in'80 and'84 on ERA and abortion.'' He said, however, that `` the potential for genuine controversy and division among us exists on ... day care, education, drugs, handicapped, AIDS _ issues that we did n't thoroughly hash out and digest in'80 and'84.'' Republican leaders have said they expect their 1988 platform to follow the same conservative lines that the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> established in 1980 and 1984 for the Reagan-Bush ticket, with some new emphasis on child care, drugs and other emergent domestic issues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters Sunday in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> he would urge his fellow Republicans to `` be a little more specific than the Democratic platform committee,'' which produced that party's most general platform in half a century. `` I think the country is entitled to know the specifics,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who claimed that the Democrats had masked their own and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' liberalism. The subcommittees _ on the economy, education, family, agriculture, energy and environment, foreign policy and defense _ will spend Tuesday drafting their planks, which the full committee will hammer out in sessions over the rest of the week. There is no doubt the party will repeat its anti-tax increase pledge from 1984 and other tenets of the Reagan-Bush administration. The 1984 Republican platform opposed any tax hikes and was silent on the Equal Rights Amendment. It endorsed proposed constitutional amendments requiring a balanced federal budget and empowering the president with the line-item veto. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform committee has been gathering testimony around the country since the end of March. The committee will formally vote on the platform it drafts next Monday, then present it the next day to the full convention for approval.

The treaty, which removes an entire class of nuclear arms, said <PERSON> Lyebedev </PERSON>, `` marks the beginning of an unprecedented stage in the history of mankind.'' `` We will perform our duties in strict compliance with the provisions of the treaty,'' said <PERSON> Lyebedev </PERSON>, speaking through an interpreter. <PERSON> Fer </PERSON> said the inspections `` are serious business. It is a task we accept with commitment.'' In recent weeks, Soviet inspectors have visited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile sites and related installations in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is the only European nation not yet visited by Soviet inspectors. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors have already visited sites in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The Florennes air base houses the 485th <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Tactical Missile Wing. Under <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 1979 decision to deploy 572 cruise and Pershing-2 missiles in the five European nations, 48 cruise missiles were to be based at <LOCATION> Florennes </LOCATION>.

Under the treaty, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to remove hundreds of ground-launched medium - and shorter-range missiles in a three-year period and not to produce or test such weapons after that The treaty also gives each party on-site inspection rights for 13 years. The treaty covers <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruise, Pershing-1A and Pershing-2 missiles and Soviet SS-20, SS-4, SS-5, SS-12 and SS-23 missiles.

Last week, a group of students barged into the office of the law school dean to demand the ouster of a junior lecturer who purportedly was considered unhelpful to first-year students. Subsequently, students at a meeting voted to launch a campus-wide class boycott, and there were reports that some students disregarding the boycott call were assaulted. <PERSON> Gerwel </PERSON> said classes were being suspended this week `` to give the university time to reflect.''

 Strong currents and muddy waters hampered efforts Monday to find the bodies of more than 400 people missing and presumed dead after a ferry capsized on the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a rescue official said. It was <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s worst boat disaster, according to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency. Only 23 bodies were found by Monday, officials and witnesses said, including seven that were swept as far as 15 miles downstream by the waters of the flood-swollen river at <LOCATION> Katihar </LOCATION>, about 650 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. About 100 people swam to safety or were rescued by villagers after the 35-year-old ferry overturned Saturday when it hit a sand bar while crossing the river. Most of the passengers were pilgrims crossing the river Hindus consider sacred on their way to a shrine in the town of <LOCATION> Deoghar </LOCATION>. `` Now it is becoming clear that some 400 people must have died in the accident,'' said <PERSON> Jyoti </PERSON> <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullick </PERSON>, vice chairman of the local municipal board. <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> divers Monday made their first attempt to reach the boat, which is resting in water up to 30 feet deep. But the divers were slowed by strong currents and muddy water, said H.S. <PERSON> Pathak </PERSON>, head of the diving team. Katihar Commissioner <PERSON> Madan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said authorities plan to break open the submerged two-deck ferry to retrieve the bodies. Soldiers on a boat used long bamboo poles to try to poke the bodies out of the vessel. About 5,000 villagers and relatives of missing passengers Monday gathered in drizzling rain on the banks of the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION> to watch the operation, according to <LOCATION> Katihar </LOCATION> Police Inspector <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON>. The ferry had a capacity to carry about 160 people, but 535 tickets were sold for the trip, according to dockworkers, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` It was badly overcrowded,'' said an official, who requested anonymity. `` Many lives could have been saved if the ferry had carried water safety equipment such as life jackets.'' Survivors said they protested when 150 bags of wheat were loaded on the vessel, which began wavering and capsized about 100 yards from shore. Boat accidents are common in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> during the annual monsoon rains when major rivers overflow their banks. At least 150 people died on July 5, 1970, when a boat capsized in <LOCATION> Krishna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The parents of a young woman strangled in Central Park charged in a $ 25 million lawsuit Monday that a tavern owner used her killer to lure underage girls to his bar. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hand </ORGANIZATION>, owned by <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>, was a `` cesspool of corruption.'' They alleged that <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON> served <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> alcohol on Aug. 26, 1986, the morning he killed their daughter, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, even though he was too young to drink. They charged that <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON> served Chambers `` as part and parcel of a scheme or plan ... to parade Chambers as a decoy and an enticement for the patronage of his social group and those of approximately similar age, and more particularly, of the feminine portion thereof.'' Chambers, 21, is serving a five - to 15-year sentence for killing Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> He pleaded guilty March 25 to first-degree manslaughter while a jury was deliberating murder charges against him following his two-month murder trial. Chambers strangled Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, 18, and left her nearly naked and battered body sprawled beneath a crabapple tree behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A bicyclist discovered the body. During the trial, <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON> put up his $ 700,000 home to secure a total of $ 157,500 bail for Chambers. He said he did it because he felt sorry for Chambers' mother, <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON>. The Levins' suit, which names <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>, and the restaurant-bar, charges the defendants were `` negligent, careless and reckless'' in `` making possible and causing'' the conduct that led to Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON> called the <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s allegations `` absolutely ridiculous.'' He has said that recent legal action against him has been vindictive because he helped the Chambers family after Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> was killed. <PERSON> Dorrian </PERSON>'s liquor license was suspended for two 10-day periods in 1988 for serving alcohol to underage patrons. In July, the <PERSON> Levins </PERSON> filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Chambers for the wrongful death of their daughter. Their lawyer, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipsig </PERSON>, said the lawsuit would hang like a `` Sword of Damocles'' over Chambers if he should ever come into any money.

 Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, seeking a renewed pledge of support from the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does n't understand the Nicaraguan Sandinistas and `` the threat they represent.'' `` He does n't understand that they are bent on not only subjecting the Nicaraguan people but to expanding their revolution throughout <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Otherwise he would n't be speaking the way he has,'' the Nicaraguan rebel leader said after addressing the Republican Platform Committee. On the other side, Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> says he found <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention inspiring and believes the Sandinista government `` can trust <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' administrative ability and the administrative ability of a future Democratic administration to change <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. policy.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, quoted in the August issue of <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I think that with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> we could have better conditions to work for a new dialogue. However, I think Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will doubtless encounter some serious obstacles; he will be subjected to McCarthyist pressures from the die-hard conservatives.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> today, <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> made his negative comments about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> after asking a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform committee to renew the party's support of the Nicaraguan rebels. The platform, to be presented to the convention next week, is expected to include language similar the party's 1984 statement of support for the Contras. During his testimony, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> avoided referring specifically to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying only that many Americans seem to lack understanding about the situation in his homeland. Questioned later by reporters, however, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who opposes aid to the Contras, `` He does n't understand the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> apparently. He does not understand the threat they represent.'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, one of seven directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance, said if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would give `` proper support'' the Contras could bring down the Sandinista government in a year. He said Sandinista soldiers would defect and the Contras could not only revive their dispersed forces of 17,000, but double their numbers in a few months. Critics see that outlook as overly optimistic, not only because of the uphill congressional battle for funds but in light of recent in-fighting among the Contra factions and defection of the southern fighting faction from the larger force. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said a repeat of the $ 100 million in military and humanitarian aid approved in 1986 could turn the tide for the weakened Contras and pressure the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> back to a serious negotiating posture. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans and Democrats are pondering a resumption of military aid to the Contras, but the figures under consideration generally are much lower. Without the aid, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> told the platform hearing, `` the chances are very dim'' for peace negotiations to resume. He told the platform committee that the Contras are committed to peace through negotiation, although the rebel leaders have rejected Sandinista proposals to resume peace talks that broke off June 9 without agreement. In late June, the Nicaraguan government offered to have talks in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> but the Contras said the talks should be in a Central American country. In <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, an aid package proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, was considered Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans. It would allow release of $ 16 million in military aid this fall if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> certified that the Nicaraguan government had disrupted the peace and stability of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> termed the $ 27 million humanitarian aid package currently proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders _ with the $ 16 million in stockpiled military supplies releaseable by separate presidential and congressional approval _ `` totally inadequate.''

<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of Burmese marched in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and 14 other cities Monday to protest the government of President <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, and eight people were killed, diplomats and official media reported. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, reported `` mass demonstrations'' in areas ranging from <LOCATION> Moulmein </LOCATION> on the southern coast to <LOCATION> Taunggyi </LOCATION> in the wild, mountainous area of the Shan states. It reported `` violent incidents'' in <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, 370 miles north of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Mergui </LOCATION> on the southern coast, with four people killed and 12 wounded by security forces in each city. No violence was reported in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Newspapers in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> reported weekend demonstrations in <LOCATION> Pegu </LOCATION>, Thanatpin and <PERSON> Yenangyaung </PERSON>, and said police opened fire to disperse crowds. At least five people were reported killed and several wounded. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> that 30,000 people marched and demonstrated in the capital Monday and more than 10,000 students, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and citizens went into the streets of <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s second-largest city. `` It was learned that the security forces used louspeakers requesting demonstrators to disperse and completely avoided using their weapons to impose control'' in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, the radio said. In a detailed account rare for <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s official media, the radio said protesters in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> marched and chanted slogans, congregating both in the heart of the city and in outlying areas. Up to 4,000 were said to have been involved in one demonstration. The radio said 62 people had been arrested for looting or `` agitation'' since Sunday. Student activists spread pamphlets urging the overthrow of <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> and had called for a nationwide general strike Monday. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> residents said the date was chosen because eight is an auspicious number and Monday was the eighth day of the eighth month of 1988. Many stores were reported closed, but it was difficult for diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> to determine how many factory workers, civil servants and others stayed away from work there and in other parts of the country. Returning tourists said taxi drivers demanded twice the normal rate for rides and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars were in great demand. Foreign journalists have followed developments by telephone and by monitoring official media because of restrictions on travel to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, the only legal entry point for most outsiders. Foreign reporters usually entered the country in the past on tourist vbisas issued at <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> embassies. Days after his election late last month, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> ordered the arrests of the most outspoken critic of the authoritarian government, former Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, other dissidents and <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent Sein Win. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said it had sent a telegram to <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> asking for `` assurances that this distinguished newsman is not being detained for exercising any of his human rights, including those of freedom of expression and free journalistic activity.'' Sein Win, 66, received the federation's Golden Pen of Freedom award in 1963. Martial law was declared in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> last Wednesday after demonstrators marched through the city demanding the ouster of <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a former general who became president and head of the government party when <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> resigned after 26 years in power. In <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, visiting Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said her government could do little to encourage democracy and a more liberal economic system in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, a former British colony. `` I do n't think that there is anything we can do,'' she told a news conference. `` It's a problem that <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> will have to solve herself. ... She's a very independent country.'' Virtually every major city and town in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has been the site of anti-government demonstrations since last fall. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio said Sunday authorities investigating recent disturbances had found a list of those `` who pulled the strings from behind the scenes,'' but gave no details. It also said 80 people detained at Insein prison had been freed. Those released _ 11 students, 66 other civilians and three civil servants _ appeared to be those among 149 reported arrested last week. Students have led the protest against <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, whom they blame for the bloody suppression of demonstrations in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> during March and June.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday that a new valve had tested out satisfactorily in the space shuttle Discovery's engine compartment and they rescheduled the ship's oft-postponed main engine test firing for Wednesday The countdown for the test will begin at 6:10 p.m. EDT Tuesday. The 22-second engine firing is set for 7:30 a.m. The engine test was halted Thursday in the last second when a sensor reported that a valve had not closed as it was supposed to. Engineers determined that the sensor, not the valve, was malfunctioning but decided to replace both parts as a unit. That required erecting scaffolding, removing extensive plumbing and wiring and gaining access to the crowded engine compartment. The changeout was completed by midnight Saturday. The work of reconnecting and testing all parts and removing the work platforms was being completed Monday. `` Work on changing the hydrogen fuel bleed valve in Discovery's number two main engine went better than expected over the weekend,'' the space agency announced Monday, in setting the new test date `` The recovery from the problem on Thursday shows that the team is working smoothly and I am expecting an on-time engine firing on Wednesday morning,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Kennedy Space Center All three of Discovery's engines will be fired, using only a portion of the half million gallons of fuel in the external tank, while the shuttle remains bolted to the launch pad. The two solid fuel rocket boosters flanking the shuttle tank will not be ignited. In the past, a flight readiness firing has been required only for new shuttles, except for one time when a malfunction made a retest necessary. But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is treating Discovery as an untried ship because of the long time since the last flight and the many changes made since the Challenger disaster. Challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch on Jan. 28, 1986, with the loss of seven lives and there have been no American manned missions since then. A leak in Challenger's right booster was blamed for the accident. The boosters have been redesigned to prevent a recurrence. Discovery's test-firing has been postponed five times for various malfunctions, including leaks in ground equipment and last wee's abort. No date has been set for Discovery's four-day flight with five astronauts aboard, but the delays have made it all but certain that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> ca n't meet a late September target.

<HEAD>Thousands of Soviet Jews Visiting Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of Soviet Jews are getting a first-hand look at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after a 21-year travel ban to the Jewish state. Some say they do n't like what they see, while others dream of staying forever. About 2,000 Soviet Jews are in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> visiting their immigrant relatives, according to Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. Hundreds more arrive each month. Until this year, relatives of the more than 200,000 Soviet Jews who emigrated to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have been permitted only telephone or letter contact, and family visits were forbidden. Although diplomatic ties cut by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to protest <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1967 seizure of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> have not been renewed, recent changes in the Soviet political climate have made tourism possible for those Jews who have relatives in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> The visitors are permitted to stay up to two months and are restricted to bringing about $ 10 a day out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Airfare and visa charges amount to about $ 3,000, a large sum for Soviets who on average make about $ 285 a month. A Foreign Ministry official said the visits were `` a very positive trend'' and were accompanied by the arrival of a Soviet consular delegation in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last year and the departure of a similar Israeli mission to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last month. Israeli officials hope the visits will help boost Soviet Jewish emigration to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which reached a record low last month. While Jewish emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> attained an eight-year high of 1,639 in July, during the first seven months of 1988 only about 12 percent of 16,178 emigrants decided to settle in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. To boost emigration, the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Russian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has begun organizing free promotional tours that include seminars on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s history and culture. Officials say the funding is unlimited. `` We've turned into a travel agency,'' one official said as he added the name of another Soviet Jew requesting a tour to a long list of visitors on his desk. `` The phones never stop ringing.'' <PERSON> Mina </PERSON> <PERSON> Helman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> said the tour had given her a glimpse of `` the astonishing <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the lively <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and the beautiful <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert.'' But some Soviet Jews said their time in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had revealed problems in finding jobs and housing, as well as a constant state of tension with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> neighbors. `` I have spent 10 days in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and now I do n't know if I want to settle here,'' said a middle-aged man who said he was a `` refusenik'' _ a Soviet Jew denied an emigration permit. <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON>, 60, a construction worker from <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, said his visit convinced him that `` Israeli politics are ugly.'' `` You have too many -LRB- political -RRB- parties. There must be a limit somewhere and too much democracy can be harmful,'' he told the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION>. Some Soviet Jewish immigrants in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> agreed their countrymen would be better off settling elsewhere. `` It's a crime to encourage people to come here. The absorption system is a disaster,'' said <PERSON> Vika </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladizhinsky </PERSON>, whose father, <PERSON> Yefim </PERSON>, a well-known immigrant painter, hanged himself in 1982 because he failed to get the reception in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> he had expected. Some Soviet Jews said the visits had strengthened their desire to live in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marina </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> teacher in her 40s who declined to give her last name, said the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> she saw during a 40-day visit was markedly different from the hostile picture portrayed in the official Soviet media. `` I thought people were being killed in the streets of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' she said of Soviet coverage of the 8-month-old Palestinian rebellion in the Israeli-occupied territories. `` I'll tell all my friends to come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> immediately.'' <PERSON> Berta </PERSON>, 66, a gynecologist on a two-week visit with her sister, said she wanted to settle in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with her husband, and was using the visit to find out about job opportunities and pensions. Most of the Soviet visitors praised <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, saying they had greatly simplified the procedure for getting exit visas One middle-aged <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> woman, her relatives said, was `` reborn,'' by her trip. The woman sat on a bench, silently embracing her mother and sister. `` She can not talk,'' the mother said. `` She is too distressed. She goes back in two days.''

His brother, who also was on the boat, lost sight of him, and went back to shore for help.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> narrowly escaped an assassination attempt today when a bomb exploded near his motorcade. A window of his wife's car was shattered, but she was not injured. The government blamed the attack on <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s motorcade _ and another bombing today at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commissary in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> _ on cocaine traffickers. No injuries were reported in either bombing, although the entrance to the commissary building was damaged. The bomb attack on <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s motorcade occurred on the outskirts of the Bolivian capital as the secretary of state and his party were driving in from the airport. The bomb blew a hole in the road and scattered chunks of pavement over a wide area. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that windows were smashed or tires blown on three cars in the motorcade. She said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, was in the first car that was damaged, medical personnel were in the second and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> was in the third. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and his wife were in separate cars. Ms. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was proceeding with his schedule as planned. `` If people are hoping for some sort of interruption in our drug interdiction efforts, that is not in the cards,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> told reporters at a briefing in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>. He said he was paraphrasing <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. The explosion occurred seconds after <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s car passed over the road but before all 11 cars in the official motorcade had gone by. The explosion occurred between the sixth and seventh vehicle. The blast was seen by this reporter from a vantage point a few cars behind the official motorcade. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombings, but Foreign Minister <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedregal </PERSON> said both were the work of cocaine dealers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cooperation with government efforts to stem the thriving cocaine trade has fueled anti-American sentiment in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. After the highway blast, dozens of police officers closed the road and climbed a nearby hill to search for the bombers. They found a wire they said had denotated the bomb by remote control. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, 67, was riding in one of the first few cars of the motorcade. Riding in his car was <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s foreign minister and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> charge d'affaires <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenley </PERSON>. A police escort accompanied the motorcade. The secretary of state had been scheduled to go the Sheraton Hotel in La Paz but instead was rushed directly to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has been secretary of state since 1982. He has traveled widely abroad during that time, but has never before been attacked. In <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was expected to praise the government's efforts in fighting cocaine production and smuggling The government crackdown, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cooperation, has angered drug barons here as well as peasants, many of whom depend on the coca crop for their livelihood. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is on a 10-day, nine-country Latin American tour aimed at gaining support for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policies. He flew to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> today from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. He began his tour Aug. 1 in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The trip was scheduled to end Wednesday in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Two Catholics Killed In Suspected Protestant Revenge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Gunmen firing from a car shot and killed two Roman Catholics on Monday in a suspected revenge slaying by Protestants for a new round of <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> attacks. The gunmen escaped after the killings in the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Ardoyne </LOCATION> area of north <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> and abandoned their car in the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Shankill </LOCATION> district, about two miles away, police said. Police sources and moderate Catholic leaders blamed the attack on <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremists taking random revenge for a series of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombings and shootings in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which left six dead and 37 injured last week. Witnesses said the assailants pumped bullets from a machine gun into <PERSON> Seamus </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, who was standing with friends on a street corner. The killers sped off into a side road as the 17-year-old fell dying from head and stomach wounds, the witnesses said. In the side street, the car was confronted by a <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> truck delivering beer to a club. The gunmen fired a burst through the windscreen, hitting the driver's assistant in the head and chest, witnesses said. The wounded man was rushed to north <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he died 30 minutes later, hospital authorities said. The youth was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. `` It is clear that loyalist -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- gunmen think they can retaliate on innocent workers for the cold-blooded murders of last week,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Feeney </PERSON>, a local councilor of the main moderate Catholic party, the Social Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, political front of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, also blamed <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> gunmen, but said the attack was not in revenge for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s latest campaign of violence against British rule. `` There is no logic behind the retaliation theory,'' said <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> councilor for <LOCATION> Ardoyne </LOCATION>. Police sources said suspicion fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> which, like the mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, is an outlawed guerrilla movement. It was the first attack for more than a month by Protestant extremists. The killings, in broad daylight in a shopping district, took place as police chiefs and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> political leaders met to try to devise new security measures against the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, preparing for next year's 20th anniversary of the deployment of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> troops to stop sectarian feuding, has said its new campaign is aimed at British military targets. Last week's attacks included bombing British army barracks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, killing two elderly Protestants on temporary maintenance work at a police station, and dragging a part-time soldier from a store and killing him in front of his family. Also on Monday, a British soldier, Cpl. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON>, 21, who was shot and wounded in <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> three weeks ago, died of his injuries, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. The three deaths brought to 1,840 the number of people killed violently in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> since sectarian violence flared in 1969 and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> sent in troops. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting a bomb-and-bullet campaign to end British rule and unite the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> dominated province with the <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> under a leftist administration. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is banned on both sides of the border.

<TEXT>
 Americans in more than 7,200 towns were set to turn on porch and house lights Tuesday night in the fifth annual `` National Night Out Against Crime.'' Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will switch on a giant light bulb in downtown <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> at 8 p.m. to kick off the symbolic message to criminals that people intend to fight for safe neighborhoods. The annual anti-crime effort is organized each year by the Pennsylvania-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Its goals are to heighten crime prevention awareness, generate support for local anti-crime efforts, strengthen neighborhood spirit and promote cooperation with law enforcement agencies. `` The event turns the clock back about 30 years to a time when neighbors routinely kept an eye out for each other, kids played outside until well after sunset and people knew the cop on the beat,'' said <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Peskin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wynnewood </LOCATION>, national project coordinator. Organizers of the national effort said lights will go on this year in all 50 states, in all the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> terrorities, and in hundreds of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases around the world. After people join in the turn-on, also depicted this year as a turn-off on drugs, they can go outside to visit with neighbors and police as well as participate in block parties, cookouts, parades and other activities. Electric industry officials estimate that leaving a couple of lights on all night for a year would cost the average homeowner about $ 30. Among events Tuesday night: In <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the world's largest banner will be unfurled, 24,000 square foot, bearing the message: `` <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>'s National Night Out Against Crime-Drugs.'' Residents of <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, plan a `` Dunk the Criminal'' booth. An 88-minute police-civilian softball game is scheduled at <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. Police in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, plan to distribute free light bulbs at a senior citizen center, and in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> seniors will launch that city's campaign by distributing blue ribbons Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> also will hand out ribbons.

<TEXT>
 Authorities investigating a boat racing accident that injured 23 spectators eliminated a floating railroad tie as the cause Monday, leaving the wake from other boats as the prime explanation. Early reports suggested the boat driven by 1987 Canadian <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> struck the railroad tie. `` There's no connection,'' said Public Safety Director <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>. `` There are no marks on it at all to indicate that it was struck by anything, and we have a witness who places it near the shore before the impact occurred.'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s boat, which was clocked at more than 116 mph during time trials for the Champion Spark Plug Grand Prix event, catapulted out of the <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, veered right and crashed into the bank, where spectators were watching the 11th annual Three Rivers Regatta. `` It just seems he hit a wake,'' <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said. `` It lifted him up in the air. When it came down it did n't come down in the manner it should have. He tried to steer the boat to the left.'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, who suffered minor injuries and shock, told police he believed his boat was buffeted by air from the boats he was following. Investigators hoped to determine the speed by studying videotape of the scene shot from a blimp for <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, television station <ORGANIZATION> WWOR </ORGANIZATION>. The station was covering the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pirates </ORGANIZATION> baseball game nearby at Three Rivers stadium. The boat appeared to slow after it veered toward shore, apparently no longer under power. `` Not only that, but as he hit, the bottom of the engine would have begun striking the bottom of the river,'' <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said. `` And there's a man-made edge, called riprap, stones together with cement, that slowed the boat tremendously.'' Divers continued looking Monday for the last missing piece of the boat, a piece of metal that was located below the propeller. The part could confirm whether debris in the river contributed to the accident, <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, city officials started reviewing crowd control measures. The <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> previously used fence to keep spectators from the river's edge, but `` for some reason ... that was discontinued,'' <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said. The fence will probably be back next year, putting an additional 15 to 20 feet of concrete walkway between the water and spectators, he said. Only one of the injured remained in critical condition Monday, said <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>. Two others improved to serious, seven remained hospitalized in serious to good condition, and 13 others were released.

<TEXT>
 The nation's governors warmly applauded President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday for a vintage attack on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and a tribute to their initiatives in dealing with national issues such as welfare and job creation. `` He was talking language we understand,'' Republican Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> said of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s address to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> replied, `` Absolutely,'' when asked if he thought it was a political speech designed to help Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the presidential campaign. `` But it was one that was appropriate within the limits of the association,'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> added. `` I think it was as political as he could be without stepping out of line.'' Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, the association's most prominent current member, was not present for the president's speech The Democratic presidential candidate planned to attend the closing session of the <ORGANIZATION> NGA </ORGANIZATION> meeting on Tuesday and then have a closed strategy session with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governors. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never mentioned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or the presidential campaign, but he touted the economic statistics certain to be a key part of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. `` Our states, like our citizens, have known the blessings of the longest peacetime economic expansion on record,'' he told the governors, citing the creation of more than 17 million jobs during his two terms as well as a current unemployment rate that is the lowest in 14 years. The largest part of the president's speech was devoted to citing the virtues of states as opposed to the federal government _ a familiar theme of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency. `` In the last seven and one-half years we have broken the federal government of its compulsion to control every breath the states take,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He said that `` too often in the past when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> listened to the states, it heard only what it wanted to hear. Today, things are different. When governors talk, we not only listen, but we hear.'' Praising state initiatives, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that `` from education, to transportation, to helping <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poor and homeless, you have led. While <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been caught up in partisan intrigue, you've gone out and done the job.'' The governors were meeting between the two national political conventions, but they studiously avoided allowing the campaign to intrude on their meeting. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> held to that non-partisan approach. But he was far more partisan during a stop at <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lens </ORGANIZATION>, a firm located a few miles from the governors meeting. Still avoiding mentioning <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by name, the president said, `` I've heard some people bad mouthing our economy recently. I think they must have stopped reading the newspaper that day in 1981 when they handed over the lease to the White House.'' He said `` some people are telling you to take for granted the economic growth of today and of the last seven years.'' He characterized that message as telling people `` you can take prosperity for granted, it's time for a change, take a chance on us.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that was `` sort of like someone telling you that you've stored up all the cold beer you could want, so now you can unplug the refrigerator. ... You ca n't unplug our pro-growth economic policies and expect things to stay the same.'' Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> retorted that `` the issue is bread and butter, not cold beer.'' <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech to the governors `` a wonderful trip down memory lane. ... All of us would agree on the importance of initiatives on the state level.'' <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would be a help to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but `` anybody, no matter how good they are, is a marginal help. It's up to the candidate who's running.''

Complaint</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 70,000 to resolve a government complaint that it discriminated against flight attendant applicants based on their citizenship status, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The settlement will cost the air carrier $ 53,000 in back pay and $ 17,000 in federal civil penalties. The agreement will affect 33 applicants who qualified as `` intending citizens,'' but whom <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> refused to consider for employment _ either because they could not produce an alien registration card or because their cards had expiration dates. `` Intending citizens'' under the 1986 immigration law are permanent and temporary residents admitted under the new legalization program, and refugees and those who have sought asylum who intend to become citizens. The act prohibits employers from discriminating against them. `` We hope this settlement will put others in the airline industry on notice that the challenged practices are proscribed by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siskind </PERSON>, the special counsel named under the statute. <PERSON> Siskind </PERSON>'s office enforces prohibitions against employment discrimination based on national origin and citizenship status. The agreement settles a complaint filed April 12 and can not be construed as an admission of liability by American, the department said.

 The discovery of new planets and of complex organic chemicals in comets is encouraging astronomers to intensify their search of the universe for intelligent life beyond the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. `` The circumstantial evidence is mounting every day'' that intelligent life could have developed elsewhere in the universe, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s radio search for life, said Monday. `` It is encouraging.'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said discoveries announced last week that planet-like objects have been found orbiting distant stars, and that organic chemicals thought to be the precursors to life exist in comets support fundamental theories about life evolving from cosmic chemistry. `` That is the circumstantial evidence that life exists elsewhere,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. `` We know now that the materials are there.

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is operated by the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, has proposed to expand the effort with sophisticated new equipment that would listen to tens of millions of channels at the same time. The equipment would be monitoried by a computer capable of identifying signals that could be sent by intelligent life. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said the new equipment would be able to look at a 1,000 different stars that are thought to be similar to the Earth's sun, locations that experts believe hold the best chance for the evolution of life. There also would be `` whole sky survey'' in many radio frequencies in which every portion of the heavens would be systematically searched. Searches in the past `` have only scratched the surface,'' said <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>. The new equipment would be 10 million times more thorough than present equipment, he said, noting, `` In the first few minutes we would be able to match all of the searches that were done before.'' But even with the new devices the job is immense, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> SETI </ORGANIZATION> committee of the astronomical union and an astronomer at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>. `` Many people think the project should succeed in the next year or two,'' he said. `` That's probably not going to happen. The universe is so huge and the cosmic haystack so large, it will take us decades.'' <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> added: `` The consequences of success are so great that it's worth dealing with the problems.'' The theory behind the SETI work is that because there are billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars, the odds are good that the conditions that permitted life to evolve on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> must exist elsewhere. If so, then intelligent life could have developed along the same lines as it did here on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Civilizations that are equal to or more advanced than humankind would be sending out signals, just as occurs on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The SETI project is looking for those signals. Such signals may `` leak out'' just as to do on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said. `` The strongest sign of our existence in the universe is the accumulation of our television signals,'' he said. The second most common radio signal from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> comes from military communications. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said the federal budget now under consideration by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> includes a $ 6 million appropriation for the enhanced <ORGANIZATION> SETI </ORGANIZATION> equipment. He said the total project would last 10 years and cost $ 90 million. If the funding is approved, the intensified search could begin in 1992, with all of the new equipment on line by 1994.

<HEAD>`L.A. Law' Star Reveals Breast Cancer; Will Do NBC Documentary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON> revealed Monday that she was undergoing treatment for breast cancer while filming the first six episodes of the hit <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> series `` L.A. Law'' two years ago. <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON> made a surprise appearance at a news conference held by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> to announce she will help produce with NBC News a documentary about breast cancer survivors, `` Destined to Survive: 100 Roads to Recovery,'' to air Oct. 12. `` I was one of the lucky ones. I did n't have to lose a breast,'' said <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON>, who said the cancer was discovered between filming of the pilot and beginning of production of the series. `` I had to undergo radiation therapy during the first six episodes of ` <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION>. Law.' It was not an easy time,'' she said. <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON> plays attorney <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON> on the series. She and co-star <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> are married in real life as well as on the series. `` Between the period of my treatment and diagnosis, I underwent a tremendous amount of soul-searching and terror, despite the incredible support of my husband, my family and my friends,'' said <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON>. `` The only real rays of hope came from the women who had been through these things and survived. They were the ones who made me feel I was n't alone.'' The documentary will profile 100 survivors of breast cancer, some famous, such as first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and others not. The aim is to encourage other women to carefully check themselves for signs of the disease. `` We brought this project to <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> because we felt, I felt he would be sympathetic because of his history with <PERSON> Hodgkin </PERSON>'s disease, because he's also destined to live,'' <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said he underwent successful treatment of <PERSON> Hodgkin </PERSON>'s disease, a form of cancer, several years ago before he went on to huge success programming <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s prime-time lineup `` When <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> brought this to me it honestly did touch a chord,'' he said. `` I do think that what this will say to people who face any form of cancer, particularly breast cancer, is that you can not only survive, you can triumph, flourish and lead meaningful, productive lives.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> notified the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Monday it will begin destroying rocket motors from <LOCATION> Pershing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> II </LOCATION> nuclear missiles on Sept. 8 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in a brief statement, said the notice was forwarded to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in accordance with the terms of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. That treaty, which became effective earlier this summer, requires the superpowers to dismantle and destroy the intermediate-and shorter-range nuclear missiles in their arsenals. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has two such types of missiles _ the ground-launched cruise missile and the Pershing II. Destruction of the solid-fuel rocket motors for the Pershing II missiles will begin on Sept. 8, `` weather permitting,'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Longhorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The motors will be destroyed through `` static firing.'' In a static firing, the motor is bolted into a concrete and steel structure, ignited and allowed to burn up all its fuel. `` The empty motor case will later be crushed and buried in an approved landfill within the grounds of the ammunition plant,'' the Pentagon said. `` Under the terms of the INF treaty, Soviet inspectors have the right to be present during the destruction process.''

<TEXT>
 Months behind in an industry where everything is due last week, producers and scriptwriters scrambled Monday to regroup after a 22-week strike that idled thousands and devastated the fall television schedule. The Writers Guild of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> membership Sunday voted 2,111 to 412, or by 83.7 percent, in favor of the pact with the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would say nobody's in fighting form,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said. The walkout crippled <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and left the upcoming TV season in shambles. The season's start will be delayed, perhaps until mid-October or later, despite the anticipated glut of written material. The production season for prime-time television usually begins in late June and early July. `` What we are going to do this morning is what we normally do in May. We have two writers' meetings today and three tomorrow,'' producer <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said in a telephone interview as he drove to work. `` We are starting from scratch, which is what everyone in town is doing.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, producer of TV's `` Beauty and the <LOCATION> Beast </LOCATION>,'' `` The Golden Girls,'' `` It's A Living'' and `` Empty Nest,'' said the networks have not reduced their orders, and he expects to produce 22 shows for `` Beauty and the Beast'' and `` The Golden Girls.'' `` Probably around the production of the fourth and fifth episode we will start to feel the crunch because of lack of planning and have to start spending more money,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` You're always behind in TV, and that will just happen sooner.'' The ratification came in the 154th day of one of the longest and most painful strikes in modern Hollywood history, eclipsing by one day the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION>'s 1960 walkout that lasted 153 days. `` There have been hardships,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolla </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, which is holding its annual conference in <LOCATION> Reno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, this week. <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolla </PERSON> said the five-month strike resulted in the worst unemployment rate in the history of his union, which covers carpenters, electricians, set decorators, costumers and other crafts. Of the 75,000-member union, up to 60 percent were unemployed, <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolla </PERSON> said. One-third of the union's members are based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wurtz </PERSON> and his writing partner, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Benest </PERSON>, have two television movies for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and two feature films for 20th Century Fox that will all be due in coming weeks. `` Today, we're starting on the second draft of one of the TV movies,'' <PERSON> Wurtz </PERSON> said. `` And we have to deliver a second draft on one of the features within six weeks.'' <PERSON> Wurtz </PERSON> said he typically writes four to five hours in the morning and devotes afternoons to business. `` Now, I might be working eight to 10 hours a day writing, and I may be working more than five days a week.'' At restaurants and messenger services, two peripheral businesses affected by the strike, managers noted an upswing in business as early as last week, when a tentative agreement was reached following several days of rumor. `` Thursday and Friday we had a little burst of business,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Casado </PERSON>, who with his wife <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> owns the El Adobe Mexican restaurant on Melrose Avenue across the street from <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>. `` I look forward to things improving. Beside the writers, you have all the extras. And the carpenters and electricians, those guys eat pretty good too,'' <PERSON> Casado </PERSON> said. `` It may take awhile. They may need a few checks to get back ahead of things.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> LA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> messenger service, also said business had picked up Thursday and Friday. Before the strike, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> LA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> dealt almost exclusively with entertainment industry clients and suffered a 50 percent loss in business. He said he pushed for new, non-entertainment clients and recouped about 90 percent of his regular business `` Now we hope to go through the roof,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> has 9,000 members, most living and working in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The alliance has 217 member companies, responsible for 85 percent of network prime-time television and 90 percent of feature film production and distribution.

<HEAD>Easter, Sons Convicted of Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman and her three sons were convicted Monday of murder in the deaths of three police officers whose bullet-riddled bodies lay in a motel room from which the family held police at bay for 10 hours. A <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated for 17 hours over four days in convicting <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> Easter, 70, and her sons, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemons </PERSON>, 44, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemons </PERSON>, 48, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemons </PERSON>, 46, of three counts of first-degree murder each. Murder convictions carry mandatory life prison terms. They were charged in the deaths of Inkster Officers <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON>, 36, and <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, 24, and Sgt. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, 41. The jury, which heard 13 weeks of testimony, also found the sons also were found guilty of felony firearms and felonious assault charges. There were many trial delays because <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemons </PERSON> must have dialysis treatments. The police officers had been trying to serve a bad check warrant on Easter and one of the Lemons when they were shot. Easter and her sons then negotiated with police for the release of the officers, who medical witnesses testified were dead during the siege at the Bungalow Motel. Police and the Easter family exchanged gunfire during much of the night of July 9, 1987, before the family gave up early the next day. They have been jailed ever since. Easter had claimed both that the officers shot each other while exchanging gunfire with the family inside the room, and that they were shot during exchanges between the family and officers outside. But autopsy reports said the officers were killed within minutes of entering the motel room. <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON> were shot 29 times each, one report said. <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> initially tried to serve the warrant and called for help from <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> when Easter asked for a delay in her arrest, saying she wanted to try to straighten the matter out without going to jail.

<HEAD>Jury Still Out on Whether Seat Belts Can Reduce Auto Injuries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Seat belt use has curtailed the number of traffic fatalities, but there is no clear-cut evidence that belt use laws have reduced the number of injuries in highway accidents, an insurance industry study claims. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> outlined the results of a study of automobile accident injury claims before and after the enactment of mandatory auto seat belt use laws in eight states. It acknowledged that belt use by motorists has reduced the number of highway fatalities but that the study `` found no clear-cut evidence of comparable reductions'' in overall injuries as reflected by accident claims in the eight states. `` These results are disappointing,'' the report added. The study, which was released this week, examined accident claims submitted before and after seat belt laws went into effect in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. While injury claims declined in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> after belt-use laws went into effect there, they increased from 2 percent to 6 percent in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> the number of injury claims remained stable even though overall collision claims increased as much as 11 percent. No significant change was found in total injury claims in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, although the most serious injuries _ those with claims of more than $ 1,000 _ increased in both states. According to the study, the sharpest injury increases were found among claims of $ 1,000 or more. Those jumped 15 percent in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 20 percent in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, 8 percent in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and as much as 7 percent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Highway safety experts suggested that belt use in some of the accidents might have prevented fatalities, but the motorists were still seriously injured _ inceasing the latter category. The sharpest decline in injury claims occurred in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> where, depending on the severity of the injury, there were 6 percent to 17 percent fewer claims filed after belt-use laws went into effect in 1985. `` Although these reductions are impressive, the magnitude of the decreases are probably due to other factors in addition to the seat belt law,'' the study said. It noted, for example, that total collision claims declined as much as 6 percent in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> during the years examined. The study suggested several reasons why the belt-use laws in the eight states did not have a greater effect on overall injury losses: _ Most insurance claims are for relatively minor injuries, while belt use is designed to be most effective in preventing serious injuries _ The benefits of belt use in preventing serious injuries may be `` masked'' by injury claims that may be relatively minor but still expensive to treat _ Insurance claim records included injuries to individuals who may not be subject to belt-use laws such as people riding in the rear seat of a car _ Some of the effects `` could easily have been masked by normal year-to-year fluctuations'' in accident claims The study compared injury claims submitted to a dozen insurance companies in the eight states during the 12 months prior to enactment of belt-use laws and during the 12 months to 24 months after the laws went into force.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will begin a cease-fire on Aug. 20 in their 8-year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> announced today. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief made the announcement to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, climaxing several days of intense diplomacy that ended a deadlock in nearly two weeks of U.N.-mediated truce talks. He said face-to-face negotiations between the two sides would begin Aug. 25 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices. The war has killed or wounded 1 million people since it began in September 1980. `` In exercise of the mandate given me by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, I now call upon the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the Republic of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to observe a cease-fire and discontinue all military activity on land, at sea and in the air, as of 0300 GMT Aug. 20 -LRB- 11 p.m. EDT Aug. 19 -RRB-,'' he said in a statement to the 15-member council. `` I note that military activity has decreased in the past few days,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief said. `` I wish on this occason to appeal to all concerned in the strongest possible terms to exercise the utmost restraint and to refrain forthwith from any hostile action on land, at sea and in the air in the period of entry into effect of the cease-fire.'' But the secretary-general did not announce the other crucial dates in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace plan: The dates for a troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange and the establishment of a tribunal to assess responsibility. Those dates are to be announced later. As he made his announcement, the envoys of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> were both in the council chamber. It was the first time the two were present together in the council since the war began. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been boycotting council sessions. Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and Ambassador <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not acknowledge each other's presence, although they passed within a few feet of each other. `` I wish to express my deepest appreciation of the efforts made by the parties, the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and others over the past two weeks,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said. `` I am confident that I shall be able to count on the continuing cooperation of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the Republic of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was to convene Tuesday to authorize the 350-man <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force which will supervise the cease-fire. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said earlier that it would take about two weeks to deploy the peacekeeping force from 24 nations that will monitor the truce along the 730-mile front. A report released today by the secretary-general estimated the cost of the force at $ 74 million for the first six months. In <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> earlier today, President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> declared the war is `` apparently coming to a close'' and said international public opinion had forced <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to drop its demand for direct talks before a cease-fire. But he said in a speech to a gathering of Islamic scholars and specialists in Third World issues that he doubts <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is genuinely interested in peace. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace talks began after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reversed itself and announced July 18 that it would accept <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598. Provisions in the resolution include troop withdrawal to international boundaries and repatriation of prisoners taken in the war. The cease-fire date announcement came after Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> delivered what amounted to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s formal acceptance of the compromise proposal Saturday by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> that a cease-fire be followed rapidly by direct talks on a lasting peace. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace talks had faltered over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s demand for face-to-face talks before a cease-fire. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s compromise accepted, <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> declared Sunday as he entered a meeting with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>: `` It's a very good day. I think we are on the road to peace.'' As he left, <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> said he had a good meeting, but when asked if he was satisfied, he said, `` That's something else.'' Before offering the compromise, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said direct talks were needed to test <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s intentions. It accepted Resolution 598 last year and said it would not now be stampeded into a cease-fire. Badly battered by a string of battlefield defeats, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had been pressing for an immediate truce. In the past few weeks, <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> has launched repeated attacks in which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says at least 1,700 of its people were injured by chemical weapons. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had been urged by many nations to compromise and agree to an early cease-fire and peace settlement. But a major factor, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats said, was the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s assurance to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> last week that its five permanent members would guarantee a peace settlement. The five _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ promised <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that they would insist that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> not exploit a truce. `` We've made another step on the road to peace,'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said after the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> met with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on Sunday. `` There are hurdles of tremendous resentment and bitterness of eight years of war, but in physical steps to end the war, we are moving rapidly.'' The <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> ambassador, Sir <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON>, said: `` We are focusing now on logistical arrangements that should follow a cease-fire.'' Asked if there were major problems, he replied: `` It's much more a question of logistics, sorting out the many problems attendant on setting up this -LRB- peacekeeping -RRB- force.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is expected to sign legislation to require nuclear power companies to take a bigger financial responsibility for damages arising from a reactor accident, an administration official said Monday. `` We have strongly supported this bill,'' the official said of the proposed 15-year renewal of the 1957 Price-Anderson Act that won final congressional approval on a voice vote Friday in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is likely that he will sign it,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Price-Anderson Act is unique because it is the only federal statute that sets a limit on how much a company or an entire industry can be forced to pay to victims of an industrial accident. The bill would set the liability limit for the nuclear generating industry at $ 7.1 billion for all damages from a single accident. That is 10 times the amount the industry was responsible for under the previous law, which expired a year ago. If damage awards exceeded the limit, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have to come up with a legislative plan to supply the rest of the money. The $ 7.1 billion limit walks a line between the nuclear industry, which sought a lower figure, and interest groups like <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader-founded </PERSON> organization which pushed for a higher limit or none at all. Public Citizen has pointed to government studies suggesting that a catastrophic nuclear accident could cause $ 100 billion or more in damages. Critics say the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> could end up providing most of the compensation. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, national field director of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` while the -LRB- new -RRB- cap is a net improvement over current law, the revision does little more than current law to encourage corporate responsibility, to protect taxpayers from having to pay for a nuclear accident or to ensure that all legitimate victims of an accident are compensated.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Unglesbee </PERSON>, director of legislative communications for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group, called the legislation `` a big step forward in compensation'' for victims. Renewal of the Price-Anderson Act is not expected to spur construction of new nuclear power plants. <PERSON> Unglesbee </PERSON> says that to revive the industry, the federal licensing procedure needs to be streamlined and a standardized plant design must be established. And barring an accident requiring large payments to victims, the higher liability limit is not expected to have any major impact on electricity rates charged by utilities with nuclear plants, according to congressional aides.

<HEAD>Former Actor Seeks House Nomination; Illinoisans To Pick Successor

<TEXT>
 Former actor <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of `` Dukes of Hazzard'' fame tries again for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in Tuesday's <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> primary, while voters in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> chose a successor to the late Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> voters also pick <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> nominees. Also at stake as Georgians settle on nominees in 10 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> districts is the Democratic nod for the seat held by Republican Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who is unopposed for his party's nomination, has been in the forefront of efforts to force an investigation of House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> In the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area's 4th congressional district, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who played the rustic mechanic `` Cooter'' on the comedy series, is regarded as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination to face Republican Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> in the fall. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, a two-term congressman whose views appeal to the religious right, is considered vulnerable as a result of his admission that he considered accepting laundered drug money during a home loan transaction. The congressman, videotaped by government investigators, said he was ashamed he considered the deal but insisted he broke no law because he ultimately rejected it. He has no primary opposition. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who won 47 percent of the vote in his race against <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> in 1986, faces attorney <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moraitakis </PERSON> and theater operator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stembler </PERSON>. In the 6th District, which runs south and west of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Worley </PERSON>, a 30-year-old attorney, and businessman <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, 51, are competing for the chance to face <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, a five-term congressman, in November. In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the election to fill the unexpired term of Price is a dress rehearsal for the Nov. 8 general election, when the same candidates vie for a full two-year term in the 21st district. Price, a Democrat who had held the seat for nearly 44 years, died April 22 at 83. Democrat <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, 38, is the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> board chairman and one of southern Illinois' most powerful party leaders. His opponent, Republican <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaffner </PERSON>, 55, an administrator at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, came within 843 votes of defeating Price in 1986. The two men had emerged as their parties' November nominees after Price announced he would not run for another term. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, the action in determining nominees for the six House seats was on the Republican side, with primary contests to determine opponents to Democratic congressmen <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> of the 2nd District and <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Nighthorse </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> in the 3rd. State Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bath </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arvada </LOCATION> and former Secretary of State <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Estill </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> face off to oppose <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district, which includes the northwest fringes of the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s first woman secretary of state. In 1980, she won the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and lost to Democrat <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> in a close race. In the 3rd District, which spans much of western and southern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, one of the two <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates, <LOCATION> Montrose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Neesham </PERSON>, has suspended his campaign. He is embroiled in a criminal investigation of alleged illegal use of county road equipment. The other, real estate agent <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Zartman </PERSON>, has been traveling 1,000 miles a week throughout the district to gain name recognition in hopes of unseating <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. And in <LOCATION> Lyons </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON>, who has been <LOCATION> Toombs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> probate judge since 1945, is seeking her 12th four-year term in office at the age of 91. `` My doctor says I'm healthy and all the lawyers in <LOCATION> Toombs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> are behind me,'' said the judge, a great-grandmother. <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Driskell </PERSON>, a legal secretary, is running against Mrs. <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> joined the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1982 and, combined with previous tasks during his service to President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, he has spent 11 years as a Cabinet officer, sixth on the all-time list. During his tenure as secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has flown over 1 million miles to more than 70 countries, and it was on a visit to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> on Monday that he had his closest brush with danger. A bomb exploded as his motorcade was making its way from the airport to downtown La Paz, but <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and other members of his party escaped injury. When <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> resigned unexpectedly as secretary in June 1982, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was intent on finding a replacement who could win swift <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> settled quickly on <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, whose appointment was greeted with bipartisan praise. He assumed his duties less than a month later, becoming the first official in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history to serve in four Cabinet-level posts _ State, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and the Office of Management and Budget. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s most significant achievement has been was a treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to abolish all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles. His biggest disappointments thus far have been the administration's inability to bring about peace and democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and to promote <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace negotiations. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> can not be faulted for lack of effort. He has made four trips to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> this year and, on Wednesday, he will make his third trip to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in five weeks. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> became secretary of state after serving as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an international construction and engineering firm where his annual income was estimated at $ 500,000 to $ 1 million. To many, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> looks and sounds like an economics professor on leave from <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which he is. `` They've established a chair in my honor,'' he frequently remarks. `` I told them when I ` m through with this job, I ` ll need a couch.''

<TEXT>
 The new Central Park Zoo opened Monday amid much fanfare, with a collection of penguins, polar bears, piranhas and their pals entertaining huge crowds in their recently renovated $ 30 million home. A four-block-long line snaked through the park within an hour of the opening as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkers </LOCATION> waited for their first look at rarities such as the Golfodulcean Dart poison frog, the tufted puffin or the plumbeous water redstart -LRB- that's a bird, folks -RRB-. `` These animals know how to act. They're not like people, who have to learn how to act,'' said 11-year-old <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON>, one of the first visitors to the Tropic Zone _ one of the zoo's three new natural habitats. Monkeys, bats, fish and frogs were featured there; the Polar Circle hosts polar bears, penguins and arctic foxes; the Temperate Territory is home to otters, red pandas, turtles and sea lions. In all, 13,701 visitors toured the three areas on its first day, the <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. `` When Mayor <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> appointed me five years ago, I promised to be a man for all species,'' said Parks Commissioner <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, who introduced the 450 animals from more than 100 species. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> then cut the ribbon to officially open the new facility before playing straight man to a frisky sea lion named <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, circling in the newly renovated sea lion tank in the middle of the park, waved to <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, waved to the visitors, caught fish tossed by the mayor and barked on request. The renovation of the zoo was supposed to cost $ 28 million, but came in at about $ 30 million, partly because work took several months longer than anticipated, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. Construction on the new zoo began in April 1985. `` The other zoo was like a Sing-Sing for animals,'' said <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, referring to the facility shut down in the winter of 1983. `` So we've built a humane zoo, a zoo for the 1990s.'' There was one other new feature: Visitors, who once toured for free, now pay $ 1; senior citizens pay 50 cents, while kids come through for a quarter.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it had successfully demonstrated a submarine `` capsule launch'' system for a Tomahawk cruise missile during a test in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The test firing was performed by the nuclear-powered USS Providence on Sunday and involved a conventional land-attack version of the Tomahawk fitted into a specially added `` capsule'' in the bow of the submarine. The cruise missile _ carrying an inert warhead for the test _ was launched from the submerged submarine and then `` flew a fully guided land-attack mission of approximately 450 miles to a recovery area on the <ORGANIZATION> Eglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, range,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The test was important because it demonstrated that land-attack cruise missiles can be carried and stored aboard a submarine in the bow, outside the pressure hull, and fired from that position, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Holsapple </PERSON>, a spokesman. Without such a capsule launch system in the bow, a submarine can not be armed with cruise missiles without reducing its arsenal of on-board torpedoes, he added.

 Here is the text of Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s statement to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, delivered in English, announcing dates for a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war and the beginning of peace talks: Members of the council are aware that over the past two weeks, I have been engaged in intensive diplomatic activity aimed at achieving the implementation of Security Council Resolution 598 -LRB- 1987 -RRB-. As a result of these efforts and in exercise of the mandate given to me by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, I now call upon the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the Republic of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to observe a cease-fire and to discontinue all military action on land, at sea and in the air as of 0300 GMT on 20 August 1988. I have been assured by the two parties to the conflict that they will observe this cease-fire in the context of the full implementation of Resolution 598. The governments of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the Republic of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have also agreed to the deployment of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observers as of the time and date of the cease-fire. I shall extend to the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and to the Republic of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> a formal invitation to send their representatives to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on 25 August for direct talks under my auspices. I am sending letters in this connection to both sides. On the date of the cease-fire, I shall confirm that I am making the necessary preparations aimed at carrying out the mandate entrusted to me by the resolution under the various operative paragraphs, in particular paragraphs 4, 6, 7 and 8. I note that military activity has decreased in the past few days. I wish on this occasion, however, to appeal to all concerned, in the strongest possible terms, to exercise the utmost restraint and to refrain from any hostile activity on land, at sea and in the air in the period before entry into effect of the cease-fire. I wish to express my deepest appreciation for the efforts made by the parties, the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and others over the past weeks. I am confident that I shall be able to count on the continuing coooperation of the representatives of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the Republic of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> when we convene in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The restoration of peace will bring to the peoples of both countries victories far greater than those of war.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House on Monday passed an emergency hunger relief bill that extends a temporary food program for a year and requires the government to buy an extra $ 110 million in surplus commodities for the needy. The bill, similar to one passed last month by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, also makes small increases in food stamp benefits and makes it easier for farmers, the disabled and the elderly to qualify for food stamps. The measure goes to a conference committee to be reconciled with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill. The House bill, passed by voice vote, extends through fiscal 1989 the <ORGANIZATION> Temporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> which distributes surplus agricultural commodities to the needy. The bill earmarks an extra $ 70 million for TEFAP and the remaining $ 40 million for commodities to be distributed by soup kitchens and food banks. Including the food stamp changes, the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has estimated the bill will cost $ 306 million in fiscal 1989, rising gradually to $ 671 million in 1993.

 The Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 28-year-old wife of Prince <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, gave birth today to a 6 lb. 12 oz. daughter, the couple's first child who is fifth in line to the British throne, Buckingham Palace said Mother and child are both doing well, the palace said. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and second son of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, was with his wife when she was `` safely delivered of a daughter at 8:18 p.m. -LRB- 3:18 p.m EDT -RRB- today,'' the palace said. `` Her Royal Highness and the child are both well,'' the palace statement concluded. The 28-year-old prince, a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant, returned to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Sunday from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, where he has been on duty with the ship HMS <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, to be on hand for the birth. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> drove his wife to the rear entrance of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> from their rented home 21 miles west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> this morning. The prince left the hospital briefly but spent the rest of the day and evening with her. The duchess' mother, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrantes </PERSON>, who had flown from her home in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> for the birth, also was at the hospital. The queen, who was opening a new Lever Brothers soap-making plant at Port Sunlight on the Wirral in northwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, joked earlier in the day that the baby was taking a long time to arrive. `` We hope it is soon. We are fed up with waiting,'' the queen told young mother <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> during a tour of the plant earlier today. Mrs. <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON>'s 22-month-old blonde, curly-haired daughter <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> handed a teddy bear to the queen, who said: `` If it is a little girl, I hope my grandchild has curly hair like this.'' Bookmakers <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> stopped taking bets on the sex and name of the baby in May after <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> was quoted as saying it would be a girl called <PERSON> Annabel </PERSON>. The baby will be Her Royal Highness, Princess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She is fifth in line to the throne behind <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, his two children, Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> himself. The queen's two other grandchildren, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zara </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, are the children of her only daughter, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, 45, the duchess' obstetrician, and a team of specialists were on hand for her arrival at the $ 590-a-day American-owned hospital. Most photographers who had camped in front of the hospital for weeks missed the duchess' arrival. Even the few who were outside the rear entrance said they caught only a glimpse of the duchess as the car sped inside. The duchess' father, Maj. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, was quoted by the British media as telling fellow polo players that baby's due date was Aug. 11. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> married the former <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> on July 23, 1986 at <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abbey </ORGANIZATION>. Hours after his arrival on Sunday, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> took his wife for a 20-minute drive in the <LOCATION> Surrey </LOCATION> countryside on what was the hottest day of the year. Outside the hospital, crowds had been waiting for several days and started growing as soon as the word was out that the duchess had been admitted. A white banner has been flying outside the hospital for several days saying: `` Any Minute Now!''

 Farm state governors Monday approved a resolution commending the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for quick action on an aid package for farmers hit hard by the drought. The governors, in a report from a task force chaired by <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>, also urged continued federal and state attention to the problems of farmers struggling to cope with today's economics and international trade imbalances. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the National Governors' Association unanimously approved a resolution praising <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for quick action on a $ 3.9 billion bill to provide emergency help to farmers whose crops and livestock are suffering because of this year's drought. `` The legislation that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is set to pass is excellent, far-reaching legislation that provides assistance to livestock and crop producers,'' the committee, chaired by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON>, a Democrat, said in its resolution. A <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee approved a compromise version of the bill Thursday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved it Monday. The legislation was expected to receive final legislative approval in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as early as Tuesday. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is expected to sign it into law within days of receiving it. Governors at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> annual meeting this week in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> has been particularly cooperative in aiding the drought relief effort. `` I've been in this business a long time, folks, and I've never seen this kind of response from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>, a member of the governors' agriculture committee The committee approved the 67-page report from <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>'s task force. The report urges federal and state governments to give continuing attention and support to rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as it fights to cope with depressed farm prices and declining value of farm land. The task force's report said the average price of farm land per acre went from $ 219 in 1972 to $ 823 in 1982, then back down to $ 547 in 1987. It urged states to help rural communities prepare for the future by creating special offices for rural affairs, providing tailored development information for rural areas and helping rural industries develop new products and find new markets. The report also urged <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to shape federal policies with more sensivitity to their impact on rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Iranian leaders issued new calls for vigilance Monday, the day the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general announced a cease-fire in the long war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, but people in the Iranian capital seemed ready for peace. Newspapers carried reports on a Cabinet meeting in which members stressed the need `` for complete readiness and presence of combatants'' and more military volunteers. State television said the Iraqis shelled a village, wounding three civilians, and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported several violations of Iranian air space by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> fighters. Residents of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> appeared convinced the end to the fighting was at hand. Even President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, who expressed serious doubts about the truce prospects a few days ago, told an international conference the 8-year-old war `` is apparently coming to a close.'' He told a conference of Islamic scholars, however, that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s conduct during negotiations at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` gives us the right to have doubts about their real aims. <PERSON> Kayhan </PERSON>, one of the main afternoon papers, carried the headline `` Cease-fire to be announced tonight.'' Inside were photographs and brief biographies of `` martyrs'' _ Iranians killed in action. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, announced Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that the truce will begin Aug. 20 and peace negotiations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will open five days later in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. A driver who spoke English and said he formerly held a well-paid job in construction, told a visitor: `` My son, <PERSON> Romin </PERSON>, has sent a message that he is coming home in four weeks now that the fighting ends. He has been in the army for two years and eight months. Luckily he has not been wounded. The place where is he is now is pretty quiet.'' A 25-year-old named <PERSON> Fahrad </PERSON> said he was excused from military service because of injuries he suffered in a car accident while studying petrochemical engineering in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Many of my generation are dead,'' he said. `` In a way I was lucky to have been in that accident.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter requested permission to visit front-line troops preparing for the truce, but a <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guidance </ORGANIZATION> official said it was not possible. A request to visit <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s war cemetery brought the same answer. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> carried comments from Iranians on Monday about the government's acceptance of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s cease-fire resolution a year after it was passed. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Morteza </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammadi </PERSON>, described as commander of `` Division 81 in <LOCATION> Khoramabad </LOCATION>'' gave what seemed a typical answer: `` Being a follower of the imam -LRB- <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Kkhomeini </PERSON> -RRB-, we obey his decree whatever it is. `` In fact, there are three major reasons for our compliance: First, being Moslems, <PERSON> Imam </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> is our religious leader. Second, being Iranians, <PERSON> Imam </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> is the leader of the leader of the Islamic revolution. Thirdly, we are the army, and <PERSON> Imam </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> is the supreme commander of the armed forces.'' Private <PERSON> Khazrullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Panah </PERSON> said:: `` Although I enjoy war, the imam's order is the ultimate order for us.'' <PERSON> Habibullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabar </PERSON>, a 20-year-old Basij -LRB- volunteer -RRB- said: `` If the imam tells us to fight for a hundred years we will. If he deems it right to negotiate with the enemy, we will too.''

<HEAD>Diner Spills Beans; Tax Refund Considered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It may not add up to a hill of beans, but some 7-Eleven store clerks have been wrongly charging state sales tax on cold burritos. The case is causing heartburn for 7-Eleven bosses and state tax authorities, who say they may have to consider a refund of excess taxes charged on the Mexican-style snacks. The state's tax agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equalization </ORGANIZATION>, is trying to work out just how much tax may have been mistakenly charged on burritos over the last three years at the 1,500 7-Eleven franchises in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hand </PERSON>, a board supervisor. There are no immediate plans for a refund but one may be considered, <ORGANIZATION> Hand </ORGANIZATION> said. Any refund would have to come from the state, since that's where the money ended up, <PERSON> Hand </PERSON> said. Burritos fall into a sort of gray area when it comes to sales tax. Fast food prepared by a store worker is taxed 6 -LCB- percent in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and 6 percent in most other counties. But food that is n't prepared by employees is n't taxed. Three years ago, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON>, who estimates he's eaten about 75 beef burritos from 7-Eleven, noticed the tax, got hot under the collar, and complained to the company. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Corlett </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 7-Eleven, said clerks were notified to sell the burritos without tax. But <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON>, 39, an unemployed electrical engineer from <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, noticed recently the tax was still being charged, and he spilled the beans to the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equalization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Corlett </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> has repeated its notice to clerks. Hand said state authorities do n't know how many burritos may have been improperly taxed. <PERSON> Corlett </PERSON> refused to reveal the extent of 7-Eleven's burrito sales in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Further complicating things is the fact 7-Elevens are equipped with microwave ovens. If clerks cook the burrito in the microwave, it's taxable; if the customer cooks his own, it's considered a grocery item and not taxable.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> exhorted Republican platform writers Monday to make GOP policies clear, including an ironclad commitment against a tax increase, rather than turn out a `` document of deceit'' as he said the Democrats had done. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the Republican platform must offer <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> voters `` a plan for the future, a statement of solutions, not an exercise in evasion.'' He journeyed here from his vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, to put his personal stamp on the platform that the 106-member committee will draft this week and present to the Republican National Convention next Tuesday. Committee members cheered when he depicted <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` the stealth candidate'' whose `` policies are invisible.'' He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' declaration in his acceptance speech that this is an election `` about competence, not ideology,'' was merely `` an attempt to convince <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that ideas do n't matter.'' `` Our campaign will be different because ideas do matter,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, adding that voters must choose between `` two entire sets of values.'' `` I will not raise your taxes, period, and I hope the plaform will say the same thing,'' he said. `` I believe that the way to cut the federal deficit is to rein in spending, not by rounding up more taxes.'' On other issues, he made a pitch for his proposed $ 2.2 billion child-care tax credit for low-income families, and pledged tough enforcement of fair trade laws. He went over many other campaign stands, including his calls for tax-free college savings bonds, a ban on ocean dumping of sludge and imposition of the death penalty for narcotics kingpins and killers of police. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised `` faster action to clean up toxic waste -LRB- and -RRB- a tougher line on acid rain.'' He repeated his pledge `` to develop and deploy a strategic defense system as soon as possible,'' and he accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of being `` silent at best and unsteady at worst'' on arms control and foreign policy issues. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, the chairman of the platform committee, hailed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as `` a champion of traditional values.'' She said that `` vague generalities in the Democratic platform are going to cost the taxpayer close to $ 45 billion in 1989.'' <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, speaking with reporters, provided no specifics but said that was the preliminary estimate of Republican analysts who have taken a close look at both the Democratic platform and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign promises Her committee spent most of the day divided into seven subcommittees, hearing testimony from more than 200 witnesses, including <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, anti-ERA activist <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlafly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Teller </PERSON>, the H-bomb inventor and father of the Strategic Defense Initiative. The 1988 GOP platform was expected to hew closely to the anti-tax and anti-abortion lines of the party's 1984 platform, with new or reworded planks on such emergent issues as AIDS, drugs, education and child care. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> urged `` the party of Lincoln'' to renew its pledge of support for the Nicaraguan rebels. He told reporters <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, an adamant opponent of Contra aid, `` does n't understand the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> apparently. He does n't understand the threat they represent He does n't understand that they are bent on ... expanding the revolution.'' In a subcommittee hearing on family and community, witnesses clashed over whether the party should change its traditional conservative positions on such issues as child care and abortion. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, director of Planned Parenthood's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office, said a poll conducted by his organization showed that the party's convention delegates `` disagree with many of the planks and with the tone of your 1984 platform around family planning and other reproductive health questions.'' For instance, he said, the 400 delegates interviewed by telephone in late June and early July by the <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haven </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, were evenly split on a constitutional amendment against abortion and a majority believed abortion a private matter between a woman, her family and doctor. But <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Americans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> said that the right-to-privacy argument is `` the new catchword for abortion.'' She and others urged the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> to maintain its condemnation of abortion. Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, one of the crafters of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, told the subcommittee on the economy, `` Half of the growth in federal revenues ought to go back to people who pull the wagon, who do the work, who pay the taxes. Democrats want people who ride in the wagon to get all the money so they can watch <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> share the reins.'' Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> told a family subcommittee that the Democrats' $ 2.5 billion child-care bill `` would throw money from the top down, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureaucratic approach.'' Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, co-chairman of the platform committee, said in an interview, `` Generally speaking, I sense we're not likely to revisit in great detail some of the debates we had in'80 and'84 on ERA and abortion.'' The seven subcommittees will vote on proposed planks Tuesday, then the full panel will spend three days trying to put the entire platform together.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> on Monday declared an immediate cease-fire in the 13-year Angolan war. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> also said it plans to begin granting independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Nov. 1. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> cautioned, however, that more talks are needed to reach agreement on a mutual date for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, commonly known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and mediators from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will seek to set a date when they hold peace talks the week of Aug. 22 at a site still to be announced. `` A de facto cessation of hostilities -LRB- in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> -RRB- is now in effect,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. `` This is the first step of a very long, arduous road to peace.'' <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government later said it had accepted the agreement along with its <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> allies. Its Foreign Ministry statement was reported by <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Angop </ORGANIZATION> news agency and monitored in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> is a former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony. The Cuban government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> said an agreement in principle ending fighting in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and granting <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> independence this year has been converted into a permanent treaty and goes into force at once. It said in a dispatch from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> last week to make the tentative 14-point agreement reached in July in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` an official treaty.'' The South-West African People's Organization -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, which has fought since 1966 for Namibian independence, said it would abide by the cease-fire pact. But <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> -RRB- said, `` There can be no effective cease-fire in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> if <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>'s position is not taken into account.'' Neither <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> was involved in the direct peace negotiations. <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebel movement has said it will not be bound by any agreement unless <ORGANIZATION> Unita </ORGANIZATION> is brought into negotiations. It seeks a power-sharing accord with the Angolan government, which refuses to negotiate with it. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> released a joint statement in the name of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, stating that the parties set a Sept. 1 deadline for agreement on a timetable for the total withdrawal of Cuban troops. Other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they believe agreement is possible if <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> drop their insistence on a four-year withdrawal time frame and agree to an 18-month to 24-month withdrawal period. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> also would have to agree on a substantial <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troop withdrawal during the early phases. The developments followed last week's fifth round of peace talks held in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> planned to pull its estimated 3,000 troops out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by Sept. 1. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> back <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> in its fight against the Angolan government, which is supported by an estimated 50,000 Cuban troops. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> sent a formal recommendation to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary - General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> indicating his country's willingness to begin withdrawing from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> on Nov. He said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> invited <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> for a visit to discuss Namibian independence. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has administered <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> for 73 years and has an estimated 50,000 troops in the territory. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will not begin pulling out of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> on Nov. 1 unless <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence date is linked with the total Cuban withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> proposed calling for Namibian independence by next June 1 if <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> leaves <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by that date. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s announcement Monday suggested the two sides were close to agreeing on a common date. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would grant <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> its independence under terms of U.N.

<HEAD>Navy Report Says Foxes Hired To Watch The Other Foxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s key contracting offices has become so dependent on outside consultants it has turned contractors into the watchdogs of other contractors, according to an internal <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> report. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general, which focuses on the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, complains that `` in some case, it has become difficult to determine where government workers' functions stop and contractors' begin.'' There also is no question but that private consultants working for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> `` have been given access to information which should be seen by only government personnel,'' the report states. Contracts have been awarded to consultants to write specifications, prepare cost estimates and monitor other contractors, the report continues. And it is `` arguable'' whether in the process, the command has n't `` abdicated to contractors whose primary motive is profit'' the responsibility for protecting the public interest, the report concluded. `` Through budget and contract review, it is estimated that -LRB- the command -RRB- will expend more than $ 500 million of its $ 708 million fiscal 1988 contract support services budget for program management support work more appropriately and traditionally performed by government employees,'' it said. The inspector general recommended the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> command slash its use of outside contractors by 50 percent over the next three years and hold `` in abeyance'' any contracts whose purpose could not be clearly established. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the Sea Systems Command had yet to respond to those recommendations. The inspector general's review was completed in April but did not become public knowledge until Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> declined to release the document after it was described in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, but a copy was obtained from sources. The Naval Sea Systems Command is the arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> responsible for procuring new ships and their on-board weapon systems. The audit results are surfacing two months after the public disclosure of a long-running <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation into defense procurement fraud. That probe has led to search warrants aimed at a variety of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and contractor officials and outside consultants, although no indictments have been returned as yet. The Justice probe appears to focus on private consultants who sell their services to military contractors, promising `` inside'' information on the government's procurement plans and the bids of other firms. Private consultants are frequently employed by the military services as well, however, and the inspector general's report criticizes the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for its reliance on such consultants and the access to sensitive information they enjoy. `` These problems, with their potential for conflict of interest and misuse of information, suggest the very circumstances involving consultants ... that appear to be at the very center of the current procurement fraud investigation,'' asserted Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The inspector general's report is `` greatly troubling,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> added in an Aug. 5 letter to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Under Secretary <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Monday the <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> was `` carefully evaluating the recommendations concerning its use of contractor support services'' and would respond `` through the chain of command.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official who asked not to be named said, however, the command had turned to consultants because there were not enough government employees familiar with the highly technical aspects of the sophisticated weapons now being purchased. Personnel restrictions imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> in recent years have prevented the command from hiring more workers itself, the source added. Thus consultants have been hired to help the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> decide what types of warships it should build; how they should be designed, and what yards should build them, the official said. Consultants also are assisting in overseeing contractor performance, the source said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> does not have any basic factual problems with this report,'' the source added. `` But given the circumstances, the <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> also does n't think it had much choice.''

<HEAD>Commission Studying Status of Nagorno-Karabakh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet commission studying conditions in a disputed southern region may recommend giving it more autonomy to help end a standoff between two ethnic groups, a prominent historian said Monday. The commission's work on the status of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is connected with preparations for a long-promised plenum of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on ethnic relations, said <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambartsumov </PERSON>. Among the compromise solutions the commission is considering is upgrading the enclave's status from an autonomous region within the Azerbaijani republic to that of an autonomous republic, which has its own constitution and laws, he said. `` We must find a realistic compromise that would take into account the aspirations of Armenian people, and the people of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, and contribute to better ethnic relations,'' he said at a government-sponsored news conference. He said he did not know when the commission would issue its report. <PERSON> Ambartsumov </PERSON>, a department head at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, is half Armenian. He appeared at a news conference sponsored by the government news agency Novosti with Azerbaijani writer <PERSON> Chengiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Guseinov </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is dominated by ethnic Armenians, who have been agitating since February to have their region taken from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and annexed to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of people have been held in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital. There have been general strikes in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Ethnic rioting broke out in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> city <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> in early March, killing 32 people, 26 of them Armenians. On July 18, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's highest executive body, rejected demands to unite <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said that the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> should hold a meeting on ethnic relations, but there has been no indication when it will be. <PERSON> Ambartsumov </PERSON> said poor reporting by Soviet media contributed to the tension in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, portraying Armenians mourning those killed in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> as extremists and nationalists. He called for `` full information, correct information,'' under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost. The situation was quieter but still tense in the southern republics. `` The situation is not very good, but it is more or less quiet and we have time to start a more profound analysis,'' he said. <PERSON> Ambartsumov </PERSON> said Armenians have gained more involvement in the life of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. `` In sharp contrast to past developments, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> today is engaged in discussion and solution of the problems of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which is part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>,'' he said. Armenian construction workers are building roads and improving the airport, and food deliveries are being made from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, he said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has directed federal agencies to develop responses in the event the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> refuses to tear down a radar installation considered by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be in violation of an arms-control treaty. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday that a third, five-year review of compliance by the superpowers to the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty will be held in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> beginning Aug. 24. He said the principal objective of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the review session is to `` obtain the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s agreement to correct its violations of the ABM treaty and to satisfy other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns regarding Soviet non-compliance with its obligations under the treaty.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, repeating a stand that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other top officials have stated in the past, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s large, `` phased-array radar'' station at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, `` is a significant violation'' of a central element of the ABM treaty of 1972. `` In preparation for the upcoming review,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s statement said, `` the president has issued guidance that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation should continue to make it clear that the existence of the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar violation calls into question the viability of the ABM treaty ... `` `` It should be dismantled without further delay and without condition,'' the statement said. `` Unless resolved, the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar violation will force the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to consider the exercise of its rights under international law to take appropriate and proportionate responses.'' The statement did not define what those responses might entail. But it did say that among the options would be for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to declare the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar `` to be a material breach of the ABM treaty.'' `` The president also has directed that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, working with other executive branch agencies and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, take the lead in developing a range of appropriate and proportionate responses for consideration if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> continues to refuse to correct the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> violation,'' the statement said. `` After hearing what the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has to say at the five-year <ORGANIZATION> ABM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>,'' it said, `` should the situation remain unresolved, the president will consult with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and our allies concerning next steps.''

 Thousands of Israeli couples were married Monday on the eighth day of the eighth month of 1988, but some astrologists said the position of the stars was not lucky for matrimonial bliss. `` We are happy to get married on this date, 8-8-88, because we become a part of history,'' one bride, identified only as <PERSON> Ayelet </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. Her fiance, <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON>, whose family name was not given, said he heard `` a lot of astrological talk about this date. If this is really true, we may be lucky.'' Another couple, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON>, said they would celebrate by `` having everything in eight: Lighting eight candles and arranging eight flowers. We shall be happy after getting married on the 8th day of the eight month,'88.'' <PERSON> Ayelet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> had a difficult time reserving a wedding hall, even for a fee of $ 9,375 that included the cost of the wedding dresses, recorded music and fried chicken for the guests, the <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamishmar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported. Reservations for wedding halls, where most Israeli marriage services are performed, had been streaming in. `` Halls throughout the country were booked solid months ago by couples seeking to take advantage,'' of what the Chinese consider to be a lucky number, the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. Many astrologists said Monday was lucky for marriage. `` The convergence of eight, a number that is suffused with life, creates circumstances ... especially favorable for romantic love by catalyzing a release of dormant positive energy forces,'' <PERSON> Madame </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheli </PERSON>, an astrologist told the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. And there were astrologists who said the position of the stars and the number eight may carry unpleasant surprises. `` There's a difficult position of the stars,'' said astrologist <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Binyamini </PERSON>. `` The whole year 1988 is thought to be a hard one because of the number eight. It's a difficult number. I would n't get married on that day. `` Such a day is good for business, money, sex ... sex by itself, not accompanied by romantics,'' she told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. She added: `` These couples would have money. But they will have to invest a great effort in building a happy marriage. I assume today's marriages would not turn that happy, especially in the area of simple family relations. One Israeli couple, <PERSON> Yochi </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Erez </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> they decided to marry on 8-8-88 because `` otherwise we would have to wait 11 years, till the 9-9-99.'' `` God forbid!,'' Ms. <PERSON> Binyamini </PERSON> said. `` Then the stars are even worse.''

<HEAD>Federal Safety Investigators Call For More Controller Training</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal safety investigators called Monday for a `` back-to-basics'' training program for air traffic controllers at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s busy O'Hare International Airport because of an unusually high number of controller errors. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said that a majority of the controller errors recorded at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>'s radar control facility during the first six months of the year involved a `` breakdown in basic -LRB- controller -RRB- skills.'' But the safety board said problems at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, the second busiest airport in the world with an average of nearly 2,200 takeoffs and landings a day, go beyond controller skills. It called on the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to take immediate actions to provide controllers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> with newer and better radar and computer equipment, find ways to increase controller staffing, reduce peak traffic loads, improve controller training and develop better quality assurance. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment directly on the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> recommendations, which came out of a special safety board investigation of <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>'s air traffic operations because of a sudden increase in controller errors earlier this year. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, however, announced that it planned a special broad-ranging review of <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> by a team of agency and aviation industry experts with a report to be submitted to <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> by Sept. 20. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said the review will go beyond air traffic control questions and include an examination of the airport's overall operation. Participants in the review will include representatives from the airlines, pilots union, various aviation organizations and the City of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. `` Overall more than 50 organizations have been invited to participate in the review,'' said <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>. <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> is the second busiest in the world with 796,939 arrivals and departures last year, second only to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> Last year <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> handled more than 56 million passengers, more than any other airport. It also has been the subject of numerous investigations by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> and congressional committees because of safety concerns. The latest investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> was prompted by reports in June that controllers had committed 19 operational errors where aircraft had been allowed to fly dangerously close to one another, seven more than during all of 1987. After examining these incidents, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators concluded that in many cases `` controllers failed to follow the procedures'' and in a majority of the cases the errors involved a `` breakdown in basic -LRB- air traffic control -RRB- skills.'' The safety board said that in many cases the controllers' performance was affected by `` excessive workload, lack of attentiveness, foregetting, perceptual problems, fatigue, and excessive time on position without a break. But the board said it was `` concerned that these controllers, working at one of the nation's busiest terminal radar facilities failed to act in accordance with basic controller standards and principles'' and questioned the effectiveness of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s overall quality control program. Other areas of <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> concern at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> were: _ Continuing excessive overtime with many controllers saying they are required to work six-day weeks. _ Shortages in the number of controllers. While the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has authorized additional controllers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>'s radar facility, the number of controllers there actually has increased by only five in the last two years, investigators said. _ The need for newer and better computer, radar and communications equipment. Some of the equipment has been in use at other facilities for years, the safety board said. It said that 26 other <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> facilities are currently scheduled to received the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s most advanced terminal radar system before it is scheduled to come to <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>

 Eight-pound, eight-ounce babies were born Monday, the date of 8-8-88, a bank offered an 88-day certificate of deposit, mathematicians declaimed on eights and gamblers went eight-ball wild. <PERSON> Kelli-Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> was born at 8:08 a.m. Monday in <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, at a weight of 8 pounds, 8 -LCB- ounces. Her mother's obstetrician, who was making his eighth delivery in his two-week-old private practice, has eight children `` It's been hysterical around here all morning,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>, head nurse in the labor and delivery unit of <ORGANIZATION> Hackensack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everybody ca n't believe it. Everybody thought they were joking with all the eights coming up,'' she said. <PERSON> Kelli-Lee </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Kirsten </PERSON>, 23, and <PERSON> James </PERSON>, 25, of <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>, coincidentally gave their daughter a name with eight letters. Not to be out-done, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Royal </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> weighed 8 pounds, 8 ounces at birth Monday at <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. His parents are <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Dinwiddie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prince <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and the Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, both 28, had a baby girl Monday at 8:18 p.m. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> time. The child's great-grandmother, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> the Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON>, last week celebrated her 88th birthday. In <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Canary </PERSON> turned 88 on the day of eights. `` I've seen a whole lot in 88 years, yes,'' Ms. <PERSON> Canary </PERSON> said. Tourists descended on tiny Eighty Eight, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and radio stations called from around the world called residents for interviews. <ORGANIZATION> Tascosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, offered 88-day personal certificates of deposit at 8 -LRB- percent interest. Minimum deposit? You guessed it: $ 8,888. The eighth day of the eighth month of the 88th year also was the kick-off day for the centennial anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mathematical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, R.I. In a press release for the weeklong conference, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, a former columnist for <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, wrote: `` Eight is, from a standpoint of pure arithmetic, the second cube, the sixth Fibonacci number, and the sum of the first three digits of pi. `` Applied to the outside world, eight takes on more glamour as the notes of an octave, the arms of an octopus, the eight-cylinder motor, stock market eighths, the figure-8 knot, the skater's figure 8, the eight-hour work day, behind the eight ball, old Spanish pieces of eight, and the eighth wonder of the world.'' Monday was the eighth birthday of <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lollar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, so his grandmother, <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lollar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, sent him a special eight ball. Her late husband, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> player <PERSON> Sherm </PERSON> <PERSON> Lollar </PERSON>, hit his 1,000 th major league hit in the eighth inning of a game in 1958 against <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> pitcher <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, then took the ball and painted it black with a white 8 Mrs. <PERSON> Lollar </PERSON> also painted an oversized card for her grandson with images of crazy eights, arachnids, the semiphore signal for 8 and an octillion _ a 1 followed by 27 zeros. She also wrote an 88-line poem in which each line ended with a word rhyming with `` eight.'' <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> gamblers also noted the date, triggered higher than usual sales in both the three-digit and four-digit daily numbers games, said <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kipp-Klecha </PERSON>. By mid-afternoon, more than 10,520 four-digit tickets with the 8888 combination had been sold, she said. <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s state lottery sold out the numbers 8888 early Monday after about 1,600 tickets were sold. `` The computer realized we had reached $ 8 million -LRB- in potential liability -RRB- and sales were stopped,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrigan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state Division of Special Revenue. That $ 8 million limit was set earlier and had nothing to do with the date. `` When you get that many numbers, it's a powerful manifestation ... because it's 11 years before it shows up again,'' said <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetto </PERSON>, a numerologist at the Chrystal Cave Bookstore in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, throngs of young West German couples rushed to city registry offices to get married, hoping the date would bring them luck. Many ceremonies were not preregistered and appeared to be spur-of-the-moment, including 58 such weddings in <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION>. More than 10,000 Germans stormed the northern Bavarian town of <LOCATION> Blindheim </LOCATION> to buy stamps bearing the village's postal code: 8888. Thousands of Israelis also filled wedding halls. A couple identified only as <PERSON> Ayelet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> said they would celebrate their anniversary by `` having everything in eight: lighting eight candles and arranging eight flowers.''

<HEAD>Detroit Papers To Join 19 Others With Working Agreements</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> will be among 20 cities in which two newspapers have combined some of their operations to keep one of the publications alive, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The joint operating agreement between the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and the Detroit News, approved Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, is the fifth approved under the Newspaper Preservation Act. The law, enacted in 1970, allows a limited antitrust exemption to preserve independent editorial voices in a community where one newspaper is in danger of failing. Many agreements that had joined the operations of newspapers in other cities before the law was enacted were grandfathered under the act and allowed to continue in effect, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ANPA </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president and general counsel. Those pre-1970 agreements had been reached by the newspapers themselves without need of any government action. Previous agreements approved under the Newspaper Preservation Act involved newspapers <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, in 1974; <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> in 1979; <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, in 1980 and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> in 1982. The <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> agreement later was dissolved. According to <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON>, other joint operating agreements grandfathered under the act and still in effect involve newspapers in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tuscon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Other agreements grandfathered under the law but were later dissolved included those between newspapers in <LOCATION> Oil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, he said.

<HEAD>Two Afghan Airmen Defect To Pakistan in Fighter Plane</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Afghan airmen in a Soviet-built MiG-19 abandoned a bombing mission over <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Monday and flew their fighter jet to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where they asked for political asylum, authorities said. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> officials meanwhile refused to confirm or deny newspaper accounts that the <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> government was holding a Soviet pilot shot down last week. Authorities at the northwest border village of <LOCATION> Parachinar </LOCATION> said the two Afghan fliers landed their fully armed plane, handed over sidearms and asked for asylum. They said the men told <LOCATION> Parachinar </LOCATION> airport security that they, along with another two fighters, had been sent from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to bomb Moslem guerrilla positions in eastern <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION> province. While the others attacked <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION>, the pilot swerved his aircraft toward <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, they said. Airport security fired on the MiG, fearing it was coming in to bomb the airport although the pilot, identified as Maj. <PERSON> Munir </PERSON>, and the other airman, Capt. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, advised the control tower they wanted to defect. They circled the airport four times before they were allowed to land, local authorities said. The fighter was loaded with rockets and bombs. Newspaper reports said a Soviet airman was flown to <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, the Pakistani capital, after surviving the downing of his Su-20 ground attack fighter by a U.S.-built <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> air force F-16 last Thursday. The plane reportedly was shot down near the border village of <LOCATION> Miranshah </LOCATION>. Over the course of the 10-year war in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a half-dozen <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> pilots have defected to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> with their aircraft. This was the first defection reported since the Soviets began their withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15. Cross-border incursions in Pakistani airspace have occurred frequently during the long conflict between the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and Islamic guerrillas. An air force official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said `` there has been some increase'' since the signing of an April 14 agreement providing for the phased withdrawal of more than 100,000 Soviet soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Guerrilla reports from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Waziristan </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Miranshah </LOCATION> is located, said four Afghan refugees were killed last Wednesday when a Soviet or Afghan fighter jet bombed Pakistani territory.

 <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> is mild of manner and would not boast of his diplomatic skill, but he had reason for pride Monday when he announced a cease-fire in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. The Iran-Iraq war is the latest in several seemingly intractable conflicts for which the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has been asked to help find a solution. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is withdrawing its estimated 115,000 soldiers from a 10-year-old civil war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed April 14. Combatants in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, southwestern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> have asked the world organization to find ways of ending their wars without a defeat for any party. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s diplomatic successes in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the gulf contrast with his early disappointment in the 74-day <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> war between <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. It was fought in 1982, the year after he became <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief executive. The soft-spoken diplomat from <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, now 68, is known for discretion and diligence. He likes to quote the French aphorism `` Le ton fait la chanson,'' which means the melody makes the song, not a loud voice. The secretary-general tried to create harmony between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s fleet of warships steamed toward the Falklands, but both sides hardened their positions after two weeks of talks. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> also claims the islands, which it calls the Malvinas. Before the Falklands conflict ended, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Israelis defied <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> demands for a cease-fire and withdrawal, and bypassed the 7,000-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. With infinite patience, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> insists it is `` much easier for a government to make concessions to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> than to make concessions to one another or to a big power.'' That theory bore fruit in the past week, when <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> abandoned its demand for direct talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as a first step toward peace, accepting <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s compromise suggestion for direct talks immediately after a cease-fire takes effect. He announced Monday that the truce would begin Aug. 20 and the peace talks Aug. 25. After he became secretary-general, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he would not seek a second five-year term because the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief must remain independent and not curry favor with the five permanent <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members. He relented, however, and was re-elected in 1986 with no serious opposition. A career diplomat, he was <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> from 1971-75 and served on the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in 1973-74. He was <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special representative to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in 1975-77 and, in 1979, was appointed undersecretary-general for political affairs. He held that post until becoming secretary-general and also was special representative to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1981.

 The Duchess of York gave birth Monday to a daughter, the first child for her and husband Prince <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and fifth in line to the British throne, Buckingham Palace announced. The child, who weighed six pounds, 12 ounces, and the mother, the former <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, are doing well, the palace said. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and second son of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, was with his wife when she was `` safely delivered of a daughter at 8:18 p.m. -LRB- 3:18 p.m. EDT -RRB- today,'' the palace said. In May, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> was quoted as saying the child would be named <PERSON> Annabel </PERSON>. `` All members of the royal family are very pleased with the news,'' a palace spokesman said later. He was not identified, in keeping with British custom. An official notice including the statement was posted on the gates of Buckingham Palace, also in keeping with royal family custom, to the cheers of a waiting crowd. Dr. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, the family pediatrician, said as he left the hospital: `` The atmosphere inside was very cheerful. Everyone is delighted.'' Town crier <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, dressed in a red tunic and swinging a brass hand bell, opened bottles of champagne and announced the birth to crowds of reporters and members of the public waiting outside the hospital. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> left the hospital hours after his daughter's birth, smiling broadly and waving to the well-wishers as got into a car and drove away slowly. Maj. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, father of the duchess, said at his country home that he was `` absolutely thrilled'' and added: `` If they've chosen a name, I'm not aware of it. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Denis </PERSON>, visiting <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, sent congratulations: `` It is wonderful news and your happiness will be shared by the whole nation.'' The baby's birth at 18 minutes past 8 p.m. on the eighth day of the eighth month of 1988 is being taken by well-wishers as a sign of good fortune. The day is considered highly auspicious by Cantonese-speaking Chinese, whose word for eight is similar to that for prosperity. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant who returned on Sunday from sea duty in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> to be with his 28-year-old wife, had driven her to the rear entrance of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> from their rented home 21 miles west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Monday morning. The prince, also 28, looked nervous and anxious as left the hospital after 1 -LCB- hours, only to return later _ still looking worried. The duchess' mother, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrantes </PERSON>, also joined her at the hospital, smiling and looking relaxed. `` Any Moment Now!'' proclaimed a banner hanging outside the hospital, where crowds gathered to await the birth of the queen's fifth grandchild Dozens of photographers who have spent weeks camped outside the hospital's main entrance missed the arrival of the red-haired duchess, and the few at the back entrance just caught a glimpse of her as the car raced by. The queen, who was opening a new soap plant at Port Sunlight on the Wirral in northwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, joked that the baby was taking a long time to arrive. `` We hope it is soon. We are fed up with waiting,'' she told young mother <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> during a tour of the plant. Mrs. <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON>'s 22-month-old, curly haired daughter, <PERSON> Carla </PERSON>, handed a teddy bear to the queen, who said: `` If it is a little girl, I hope my grandchild has curly hair like this.'' The baby will be Her Royal Highness, Princess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She is fifth in line to the throne behind <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, his two children, Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> himself. The queen's two other grandchildren, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zara </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, are the children of her only daughter, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>. Millions of TV viewers around the world watched the July 23, 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abbey </ORGANIZATION> wedding of the handsome prince and the vivacious young working woman he had known since childhood. The duchess chose Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON> as her obstetrician rather than the queen's gynecologist, Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinker </PERSON>, who has delivered all royal babies for the past 10 years. The duchess also broke tradition by choosing the modern 86-bed <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, which costs $ 588 a day and is privately owned by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>'s sisters-in-law, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and the Princess of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, used the private wing of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paddington </LOCATION>, a hospital of the government-funded <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The day after the duchess' pregnancy was announced Jan. 25, she celebrated by flying a helicopter from a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Oxfordshire </LOCATION>. The rest of her pregnancy was action-packed, including three skiing trips. She suffered a fall while on the slopes at <LOCATION> Klosters </LOCATION> when she was four months pregnant. On July 8, she escaped injury when her car collided with an oncoming car on a highway 20 miles outside <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

 The five-month writers strike that just ended will push back <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s mid-season replacements a month or so, but otherwise the network is in good shape for the fall, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> will have two weeks of prime-time coverage of the Summer Olympics beginning Sept. 15. That made the network less vulnerable to delays in the new season of entertainment shows caused by the strike, but had threatened to devalue the promotional platform afforded by the multimillion-dollar Olympics coverage. `` We've had a lot of time to sort of digest what was happening and prepare for the day when it -LRB- the strike -RRB- would be over,'' <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> told a news conference, though he added, `` I would say nobody's in fighting form.'' Most of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s schedule will premiere in October. Three shows that make up the Tuesday lineup, `` <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>,'' `` In the Heat of the Night'' and `` Midnight Caller,'' will be delayed until the end of November because of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s airing of its miniseries `` War and Remembrance'' that month, not directly because of the strike, <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said. Premiering the week of Oct. 3 will be `` ALF,'' `` The <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> Family,'' `` Unsolved Mysteries,'' `` Highway to Heaven,'' `` The Cosby Show,'' `` A Different World,'' `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' `` <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Spoon </PERSON>,'' `` 227,'' `` Amen,'' `` Golden Girls,'' `` Empty Nest'' and `` The Magical World of Disney.'' The week of Oct. 24 will have `` Tattinger's,'' `` Something Is Out There,'' `` <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>,'' `` Family Ties'' and `` Day by Day.'' The next week, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> will add `` Baby Boom,'' `` Night Court,'' `` Cheers,'' `` L.A. Law'' and `` Miami Vice.'' `` It's not going to be our tack to rush shows on the air, particularly the new ones, and diminish the possibility for long-term success to get on one week early,'' <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said. `` We were prepared and we did give script orders early enough so they could be meaningful at this time. I think that's why we're getting on sooner'' than the other two networks, he said Besides the Olympics, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> also had several series, including its top-rated `` The Cosby Show,'' that were able to stay in production under independent contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>. `` Mid-season might come after the February sweeps,'' a delay of about a month, <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said. `` Hardy Boys,'' a remake considered during the strike, will be made as a two-hour movie, but <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has no series commitment. The extensive research the network did in looking for old shows to re-shoot was not an exercise in futility, <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said. `` We did the entire history of television in a seven-week period,'' he said. `` The one thing you realize when you go back is that television at one time was a much more varied marketplace, and there were a lot more interesting ideas out there than are the tableaux today. Out of that there have been some ideas and offshoots'' that could become the germs of new series ideas. <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> also announced that <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has struck a deal with the network's former president, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinker </PERSON>, who now heads <ORGANIZATION> GTG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, for a two-hour pilot called `` Bay Watch.'' It would hit the air in the fall of 1989. Tinker currently is producing two shows for CBS.

<DATELINE>BRIGHAM CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The last of five full-scale test-firings required to qualify the redesigned space shuttle booster rocket for flight is scheduled for Aug. 18, <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday. A successful test of the 126-foot-long rocket at the aerospace company's northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> plant 25 miles west of here would clear the way for resumption of shuttle flights, on hold since the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger disaster. A faulty seal between sections of one of Challenger's two boosters was blamed by a presidential commission for the explosion that destroyed the spacecraft shortly after launch. <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said next week's test, following the successful fourth firing on June 14, will incorporate several intentional flaws to test backup systems to their limits. `` It's severely flawed. It has flaws in every joint but one. Two of the three field joints and the case-to-nozzle joint are flawed,'' he said. `` We have already tested full-sized motors in short duration tests with these same types of flaws. This test will allow us to demonstrate that with a full-duration test, further adding to the confidence in the redesign,'' <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> added. The two-minute test will burn approximately 1.1 million pounds of solid fuel propellant, sending a cloud of smoke and flame thousands of feet into the sky. The redesigned rocket developed by <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> to replace Challenger-era boosters incorporates new and additional O-ring seals made of cold-resistant materials, as well as improved insulation intended to further reduce the possibility of flaming exhaust gases leaking through a joint rather than the rocket motor. Such a leak ignited Challenger's exterior liquid fuel tank.

<HEAD>Three More Children Won't Testify In McMartin Pre-School Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Three children have refused to testify in the <ORGANIZATION> McMartin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pre-School </ORGANIZATION> molestation trial, a prosecutor said Monday, placing in jeopardy 27 of the 99 molestation charges against the school's operators. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Lael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said outside court that the prosecution might try to prove the charges without the three children, `` but it's an extraordinarily difficult thing to do.'' She said the children have refused to testify because they do n't want to revive painful memories and because they remain traumatized Two boys, she said, continue to have `` strong nightmares,'' and one girl has lost her memory of all events prior to a year ago _ a sign of `` massive depression.'' `` While we have a responsiblity to present all of the evidence, we also have a responsiblity not to increase trauma to kids,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> told reporters of the decision not to force the children into court. Another child refused to testify last month, and the judge refused a prosecution bid to use her videotaped preliminary hearing testimony from 1985. Three charges were based on her allegations. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 61, are charged with 99 molestations and one joint count of conspiracy with 82 of the counts naming only <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>. The molestations allegedly took place at their now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> McMartin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pre-School </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. The case has been in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> courts for five years, and the trial has been under way for more than a year. Nine children have testified so far in the case, which once focused on 41 youngsters. With 30 charges resting on four children who will not testify, the prosecution stands to lose nearly a third of the charges to dismissal if the judge finds insufficient evidence to support them. <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said outside court he was not surprised at the development and had suspected earlier that the prosecution would drop some of the child witnesses. `` The remaining three witnesses had more contradictions and unbelievable accounts -LRB- in their testimony -RRB-,'' he said. `` They were a liablity -LRB- to the prosecution. -RRB- `` I think the prosecution case is falling of its own weight.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he would vigorously oppose any effort to have the children's parents testify instead of the alleged victims. Prosecutors dropped charges against five other teachers at the school in 1986.

 Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> announced Monday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will begin a cease-fire in their 8-year-old war on Aug. 20 and will open peace negotitions five days later in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` The restoration of peace will bring to the peoples of both countries victories far greater than those of war,'' he said in a statement, capping a full year of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace efforts and three weeks of intense, delicate diplomacy. The <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war killed or wounded more than 1 million people and cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief told the 15-nation <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> the two sides would begin direct talks on a comprehensive peace settlement Aug. 25 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. He said he would preside and the level of the talks was to be decided. `` I now call upon the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the Republic of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to observe a cease-fire and to discontinue all military action on land, at sea and in the air as of 0300 GMT on 20 August 1988,'' he said in his statement. The starting time of 3 a.m. <ORGANIZATION> Greenwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> Aug. 20 is 11 p.m. EDT Aug. 19. `` I have been assured by the two parties to the conflict that they will observe this cease-fire in the context of the full implementation of Resolution 598,'' a peace plan adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> more than a year ago. As he spoke, the envoys of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> were both present in the Security Council for the first time since the war started. But Iranian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> and Iraqi Ambassador <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> did not acknowledge each other's presence. The council will meet Tuesday to authorize a 350-man unarmed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace-keeping force, including a naval contingent, to monitor the cease-fire and troop withdrawal. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> did not announce dates for all peace plan elements, including troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange, direct peace talks and an investigation into which side started the war. The agreement is the second <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> negotiating success this year. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is withdrawing Soviet soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed April 14. `` This is not a personal success for me,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said later in answer to reporters' questions. `` It is a success for the two parties, for the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, for the U.N. organization.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, later told a news conference: `` I wish to declare my government is prepared to accept the demand of the secretary-general and that of the entire world community to refrain from any military action on land, sea and air, starting today.'' `` Let me express my sincere hope that today's historic announcement will be the first step in the implementation of all provisions of Resolution 598, and the achievement of a just, comprehensive and honorable setttlement, returning peace and stability to all the region.''. Asked if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was ready to make peace with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, he said: `` Of course, there is no question about it.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> told reporters: `` This is a happy day. I do n't think anyone is unhappy We in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been waiting for this day ... `` Now we begin the arduous but happy march that begins from here. I am sure it will not be a smooth road, but it will be much more pleasant than fighting and bloodshed.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> told reporters: `` This is a historic date for the participating countries, a historic day for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> which has pressed so hard to bring this war to and end, and a truly historic day for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had foreign exchange reserves of $ 35 billion when the war began and now owes an estimated $ 60 billion. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has not borrowed, but its foreign exchange reserves have declined to a few billion dollars. A financial journal published in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, estimates <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> needs $ 80 billion and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> $ 30 billion to rebuild transportation, oil installations, housing, factories, schools and hospitals. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> negotiations had been deadlocked over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s demand for direct talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> before a cease-fire. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had rejected that demand, saying it wanted a truce first, then direct talks. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> proposed a compromise formula that includes direct talks immediately after a cease-fire. People in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> seemed convinced Monday the fighting would end. A 25-year-old man named <PERSON> Fahrad </PERSON> said he was excused from military service because of injuries suffered in a car crash while studying petrochemical engineering in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He told an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter: `` Many of my generation are dead. In a way I was lucky to have been in that accident.'' Diplomats in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> said efforts to keep the guns silent may continue for years because of border and other issues. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in September 1980 after border skirmishes. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` We may finally see an end to that long and bloody war. ... I applaud and encourage the efforts of Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar.'' About two weeks will be needed to deploy the peacekeepers and their operation will cost $ 74 million for the six months authorized. They will be drawn from about 25 nations, each paying for the soldiers it sends. A report by <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> will: _ Establish agreed cease-fire lines on the basis of forward defended areas existing when the truce begins, with adjustments when the sides are too close _ Monitor compliance with the cease-fire _ Investigate alleged violations and restore the situation in each case _ Use negotiations to prevent changes in the status quo pending withdrawal to internationally recognized boundaries _ Supervise, verify and confirm withdrawal _ Obtain agreement on other arrangements, such as weapons limitations near the border and patrolling of sensitive areas by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> naval personnel

<HEAD>Scientists Announce Discovery of Most Distant Galaxy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Astronomers on Monday announced the discovery of the most distant galaxy known, a cluster of stars 15 billion light years away that formed long before the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and the sun. `` This is very unusual and very rare,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, one of the co-discovers. `` We're seeing something from before the Earth formed, possibly before our own galaxy, and when the universe was very different than today.'' The distant galaxy, known as 4C41 .17, is far too faint to be seen by the eye, but it emits a radio signal a billion times more powerful than the sun's radio signal `` It is one of the most powerful radio galaxies we know of,'' said Chambers. Though the galaxy was located by radio signals, its distance from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> was established by analyzing the optical spectrum, or type of light, put out by the galaxy. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said the galaxy puts out a sharp optical signal of the type characteristic of hydrogen and carbon. The wavelength of the emission, however, is stretched by movement away from the observer. This stretch causes the light color to shift toward red, the so-called `` red shift.'' By measuring this shift, the astronomers could calculate the distance of the galaxy. A red shift of 3.8 found for 4C41 .17 shows that it is about 15 billion light years away A light year is the distance light travels in a year, about 5.8 trillion miles. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said at 15 billion light years, the galaxy is about 90 percent of the distance to what is thought to be the edge of the universe. He said it also gives a view back in time and the galaxy as seen now is only few billion years after the Big Bang, the massive explosion that is thought to have started the universe expanding outward. The galaxy is thought to be `` primitive,'' or in an early stage of formation, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said. `` To be able to study the dynamics as it is forming will tell us a lot of how galaxies are formed,'' he said. The Earth and sun are thought to have formed about 4.6 billion years ago. The study of the distant galaxy was announced at the 20th assembly of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Chambers' co-discovers were <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miley </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> representative at the <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telescope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Wil </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruegel </PERSON>, an astronomer at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said Monday that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is continuing `` destructive actions'' in violation of the pact intended to end the war in <LOCATION> Afghanisan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> made the comment during a meeting at the Foreign Ministry with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> returned Sunday from a four-day visit to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> requested the meeting. While in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> officials said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was continuing to supply weapons to the rebels fighting <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to help the government fight the anti-communist rebels.

It was estimated that the Soviets had about 120,000 military personnel in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> when the withdrawal began May 15. The pact called for half the Soviet forces to be out of the country by Aug. 15 <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, in his talks with <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>, `` corroborated the viewpoint that an obvious imbalance emerged in the Afghan settlement.'' It quoted him as saying, `` At a time when the Afghan government and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> consistently adhered to the course toward implementing in full the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> continued destructive actions.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as a guarantor, has an obligation to ensure `` the letter and the spirit'' of the pact, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. It said <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> delivered a letter to the foreign minister from Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, but said nothing about the contents. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> declined to comment about the letter. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> Sunday that the Soviet withdrawal would would proceed on schedule despite the Pakistani `` infractions.'' He said the Soviet troops would be out of 25 of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s 30 provinces soon, and half of the force would be out as promised by Aug. 15. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> did not specify the five provinces where Soviet troops would remain for some time. Afghan officials earlier this year announced formation of a special northern zone, where the bulk of the nation's natural resources are located, and it is believed the government is establishing a stronghold.

<HEAD>House OKs Bill To Combat Illegal Ivory Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Monday passed legislation to combat illegal trafficking in African elephant ivory. Sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by voice vote, the measure would prohibit imports into this country of any ivory taken in violation of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. That worldwide agreement uses a system of quotas and ivory markings in an effort to regulate the international trade in ivory from African elephants, whose numbers have fallen to an estimated 700,000 from 1.5 million in 1979. The bill would ban importation of raw ivory from any nation without a native elephant population and would prohibit exportation of raw ivory from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The legislation would require the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to license all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial importers and exporters of ivory and to declare moratoria on ivory imports from nations lacking adequate elephant protection programs. The department would have to do a country-by-country review of the programs and decide by Dec. 31, 1989, whether a particular nation's preservation efforts are adequate. Violations of the proposed law would carry a maximum civil penalty of $ 5,000 and a maximum criminal penalty of a $ 200,000 fine and a year in prison.

 Republican support for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> aid plan collapsed Monday after <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators and leaders of the Nicaraguan rebels denounced it and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials said it might prove impossible to implement. Following an hour-long private meeting to discuss the Democratic attempt to forge a bipartisan Contra-aid policy, many Republicans emerged to criticize the effort, some calling it an attempt to provide political cover for opponents of Contra aid. `` The Democratic plan is unsatisfactory,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION> `` I hope they will change their minds and do what has to be done.'' `` They know that it wo n't work or they would n't be supporting it,'' Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said of the Democrats. He complained that many of the Democrats who have added their support to the compromise effort are long-time opponents of arming the Contra rebels to fight <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., who took part in the initial negotiations last week, told reporters: `` Negotiations are over with I do n't think there is any more room. We've gone as far as we can go.'' He predicted Democrats will hold together on the issue, and he dismissed the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> complaints, saying `` They really do n't have a leg to stand on, substantively.'' Despite the rancor, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said he would take `` one last shot'' at meeting his colleagues' objections to the proposal And Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the chief architect of the Democratic Contra-aid package, said discussions had resumed between the White House and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s office and told his colleagues: `` I still hope that we can have the co-sponsorship of my amendment by Mr. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and others on the Republican I would like to have an action by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that is strongly bipartisan.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said that in the hours after the breakup of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators' meeting some progress at compromise had been made. But he added: `` I would n't want to be overly optimistic.'' Sources inside the meeting said <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser, reported that representatives of the government agencies that would have to implement the plan told him it does not provide sufficient funds to do the job <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> told reporters on Friday that he thought progress had been made in working out an acceptable package but a source quoted him as telling the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators that the White House now has serious reservations about it. `` He said, `` We can not implement it. We've talked with the people who would have to implement it and it can not be done,''' according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They also said Contra leaders contacted the White House and several <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators Monday morning to declare their unanimous opposition to the plan. They quoted them as saying they would rather risk getting no aid at all than to accept restrictions drafted by the Democrats. <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> resistance forces, told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> leaders see the Democratic plan as unacceptable and resulting from `` internal politics in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> which basically seek to reward -LRB- Nicaraguan President -RRB- <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> for not complying with the commitments of the peace process.'' `` This new legislation will only increase the pressures on the resistance which brought the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to the negotiating table,'' <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said. `` It will place the option on us to surrender or become refugees.'' Virtually all <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats had endorsed the compromise drafted late last week by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and a handful of other leaders of both The Democratic plan would permit $ 27.1 million in immediate non-lethal `` humanitarian'' logistical aid to the Contras. But it also would give <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> an opportunity to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in September or October to release some $ 16.3 million in previously purchased arms, ammunition and other military supplies now stored in warehouses in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, promised <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders last week that they would bring a military aid proposal to a prompt vote in both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> certifies that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has disrupted the `` peace and stability'' of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by taking two of three possible actions. The three include: an unprovoked military attack on the Contras; continued `` blatant violations'' of the regional peace plan; and continued `` unacceptable levels of military assistance by Soviet-bloc countries, including <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' But several Republicans emerging from the meeting, most of them Contra supporters, said the plan is fatally flawed. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said a chief objection is that there is no effective method of getting the military supplies to the Contras inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> from the warehouses in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` They would have to come out of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to pick it up in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. `` That wo n't work.'' Some senators also complained that the Democratic plan bars <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies and the Pentagon from delivering military aid to the Contras, saying that because deliveries must be made in the face of the Sandinista armed forces, those are the only agencies equipped to do the job. Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, said the Democratic plan is intended merely to provide political insurance for Contra-aid opponents. `` We should n't give cover to the people who have been trying to destroy the freedom fighters for their entire careers in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> said. `` It's just a political cover for people to use so they can say they are for Contra aid when in reality it's a death knell for the Contras.'' He said there was an apparent consensus inside the meeting that Republicans should seek a vote on a proposal drafted earlier by <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> that would not only provide `` humanitarian'' aid for the Contras and a vote on releasing the stored arms already approved but would provide $ 20 million in new military aid as well. If the <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> plan were adopted it could defuse a potential embarrassment for the Democrats whose presidential candidate, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, has opposed military aid to the Contras while his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, has voted for it in the past.

 <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenay </PERSON>, a professional soldier who became a major figure in the French Resistance during the Nazi occupation of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in World War II, died at the age of 82, family members said Monday. Frenay died Saturday in <LOCATION> Porte-Vecchio </LOCATION> on the French Mediterranean island of <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION>, the home of his wife, <PERSON> Chilina </PERSON>, and was buried there Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported. Cause of death was not given. His only child, <PERSON> Henri </PERSON>, said in a statement that a Mass would be celebrated in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> at a date to be announced later. On Monday night, the presidential palace said in a statement that President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> would attend the ceremony and `` would hope the nation renders a solemn homage to <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenay </PERSON>.'' Last March, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, himself a Resistance figure, awarded Frenay the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor, calling him `` the incarnation of the young, interior Resistance.'' Frenay _ known by the pseudonym <PERSON> Charvet </PERSON> _ founded the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> during the occupation, the Resistance group Combat, and the underground <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> newspaper of the same name. Born Nov. 19, 1905 in <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frenay </PERSON> was educated at <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s military academy, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cyr </LOCATION> A captain when <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in May 1940, <PERSON> Frenay </PERSON> was captured the following month, but escaped. He returned to <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> where he at once began organizing resistance against the Germans. After the Liberation, he served in the provisional governments of 1944 and 1945 as minister for prisoners, deportees and refugees. He was promoted to colonel in 1945. <PERSON> Frenay </PERSON> wrote several books on the Resistance, including `` La Nuit Finira'' -LRB- The Night Will End -RRB-, published in 1974; `` Volontaires de la Nuit'' -LRB- Volunteers of the Night -RRB- 1975, and `` L'Enigme Jean Moulin'' -LRB- The Jean Moulin Riddle -RRB- 1977. His vision of his mission differed from that of Gen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>, who wanted all resistance groups to work under the umbrella of his London-based leadership. `` Well, <PERSON> Charvet </PERSON>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> will choose between you and me,'' Frenay, quoting <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>, recounted in his book `` La Nuit Finira.'' In the 1965 presidential election, <PERSON> Frenay </PERSON> called for a vote against <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>, who he said represented a `` haughty and obsolete nationalism.'' After the war, <PERSON> Frenay </PERSON> became administrator of a toy company.

 Proponents of making English the state's official language got enough signatures with one day to spare to put their proposed constitutional amendment before the voters. The group, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> English, thought it had enough signatures to get the issue on the November ballot, but last Tuesday learned it was 930 short. `` They have made it,'' <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, assistant director of the division of elections, said Monday afteroon. The deadline was Tuesday at 5 p.m. `` Now that it's on the ballot, we think it will pass overwhelmingly,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> English. `` We still have more work ahead of us,'' <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` We overcame some odds _ you know, the last minute numbers problem.'' The referendum would ask voters to designate English as the official language, but would leave it up to the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to decide what, if any, government practices would be changed. In June, a group called English Plus, launched a campaign against the constitutional amendment, saying the law is discriminatory and could cripple business and tourism in a state with strong ties to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Signatures of 8 percent of the Floridians who voted in the last general election are needed to get an amendment on the ballot by initiative. Besides that statewide requirement of 342,939 names, the 8 percent minimum must be met in 10 of the state's 19 congressional districts, which was what gave <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> English some trouble. The group collected 5,273 signatures to make up for the signature shortage in three days, <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> said.

 A fire alarm went off when a fatal blaze broke out at a retirement home, but an employee turned it off because residents previously had activated the alarm as a prank, police said Monday. One resident, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheder </PERSON>, 74, died in Sunday's fire at the Golden Age Retirement Home and 17 other residents were taken to hospitals, mainly for treatment of smoke inhalation. Four rescue workers and a man who aided them also were treated for smoke inhalation and exhaustion. The fire may have been caused by someone smoking in a room, said <PERSON> Cherian </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>, owner of the 23-resident home in this <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> suburb. The official cause of the fire was still uncertain, police spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaisted </PERSON> said, however. The facility has smoke detectors and passed a fire department inspection in March 1988, <PERSON> Plaisted </PERSON> said. But when a detector went off, the employee `` turned it off thinking -LRB- the residents -RRB- were playing with it. Some people in the neighborhood spotted the fire and called it in,'' <PERSON> Plaisted </PERSON> said. The quick work of two police officers in the area when the call came in and a civilian who aided them saved lives in the nursing home as thick, black smoke swept through it, the spokesman said. `` They went in there with reckless abandon, kicking open bedroom doors,'' he said. Damage to the one-story structure was not heavy; no official damage estimate was released. `` I think it's a tragedy because one loss of life occurred,'' Fire Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pudney </PERSON> said, `` but it could have been worse.'' The blaze was put out within 11 minutes, he said. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> said the fire began in Sheder's room. He said <PERSON> Sheder </PERSON> had been warned not to smoke in his room.

<HEAD>House Bill Prohibits Converting Local Contributions To National
Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation Monday to prohibit political contributions for state and local campaigns from being used for a federal race _ a step critics say amounts to protection for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The bill was sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by voice vote. However, several members disputed criticism voiced by <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON>, president of the self-described citizens lobby Common Cause. Current election law permits some money raised for state or local races to be used in a campaign for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> so long as the candidate did not violate any federal restrictions on the sources or amounts of contributions. In a letter last week to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> said that with the proposed law `` incumbent members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be making it far more difficult for a state or local official to challenge a sitting member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could continue, as they now do, to raise re-election campaign funds throughout their term while preventing challengers from using any money that may have been raised prior to declaring for federal office, even though that money meets contribution limits in federal law,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> noted that the bill by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., `` does not provide a similar prohibition on <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members using money raised for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> races to run for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The bill's floor manager, Rep. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, D-Wash., said the proposal is intended to `` close a loophole'' in campaign law created by a ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> said the ruling, for example, allows a state official to use contributions from corporations _ illegal for federal offices _ to cover some expenses connected with raising money for a congressional race. <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> and other members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for failing to produce `` a single piece of meaningful campaign finance reform legislation'' in recent years. <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> said, however, that the panel wo n't propose any major reform package until the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> first passes one. Senate Democrats ran into paralyzing Republican filibusters in 1987 and 1988 when they tried to move a bill setting up spending limits for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races.

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the boss of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, declared Monday that both their countries are victims of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialist policies. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under federal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on drug trafficking charges, welcomed <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> personally when the Nicaraguan leader arrived at a military air base for an unannounced three-day official visit. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said his trip was a gesture of solidarity with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` We are here to emphasize the gratitude of the Nicaraguan people to the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, who like the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> people are under attack by imperialist policies'' of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said in a brief statement to reporters. `` We are also here to ratify the friendly relations existing between the people and government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the people and government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s visit `` shows the points of agreement that exist among peoples who are the object of aggression.''

 Attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> have protested the sale of his deposition transcript to a newspaper and asked a bankruptcy judge to keep future depositions secret, one of his lawyers said Monday. The Charlotte -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Observer on Wednesday published excerpts of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s sworn statements to attorneys. In the Observer story, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he believed thousands of internal <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> documents had been destroyed since he resigned as president in March 1987 in a sex and money scandal. Ministry officials have denied that. The ministry has been in Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings since June 1987 and must sell off assets to pay debts. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> attorneys <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> won a court order Thursday to protect the defrocked minister from the release of further transcripts. The Observer had purchased the documents from the court reporter transcribing <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s deposition. <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> said the Observer obtained about half of 20 hours of deposition given by <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> so far and that about five more hours of testimony is yet to be given. In his ruling, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> ordered the transcript sealed and filed with the court clerk at the federal courthouse in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. He noted that neither <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> nor his attorneys had reviewed the transcripts before their sale. The court reporter told <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> she released the transcript after getting permission from the bankruptcy trustee's attorney, <PERSON> Toms </PERSON>' motion said The lawyer said Monday he thought it unfair to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to release the transcripts piecemeal and before they had properly entered court. `` If you release portions of it, you're releasing it in fragments, for one thing, before the whole story is told,'' he said from his office in <LOCATION> Hendersonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> On Friday, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s attorneys asked <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> to clarify his position on release of depositions before the process continues. `` We're going to basically ask him to say he meant what he said,'' <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> said Monday. The Observer said it plans to protest the order, but it is not clear when the bankruptcy court might take up the issue again. A court official said Monday the matter had not yet been added to the agenda of the next hearing, which is scheduled for Thursday. Observer Managing Editor <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Ethridge </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said he believed the story based on the transcripts was fair, accurate and would not interfere with justice. `` It's not as though it alters the truth,'' <PERSON> Ethridge </PERSON> said. He said reporters frequently buy transcripts of trials before they are entered into the court record. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is preparing to defend himself against a $ 52 million lawsuit filed by <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> that charges him with grossly mismanaging the ministry, the business he founded but later left after acknowledging a sexual encounter with a church secretary. The <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit alleges that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and former aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> took millions of dollars from the ministry for their personal use even though they knew <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> faced financial trouble. On Friday, bankruptcy Trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> announced a tentative agreement to sell <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> theme park, satellite television network and 1,700 undeveloped acres for $ 113 million to a Canadian company, <ORGANIZATION> Samoth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, teeing off on his Democratic opponent during a rare pre-convention platform appearance, accused <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Monday of being `` the stealth candidate'' pushing policies that `` can be neither seen nor heard.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ whose lead in the national polls has triggered an avalanche of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacks in the past week _ told reporters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> he was not going to respond `` every day to what some speechwriter has put in front of Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has some of the highest negatives ever recorded in the history of American politics and I think one of the reasons for it is people have seen his campaign as an essentially negative campaign,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. While the presidential contenders engaged in long-distance sniping, the Republicans' convention city turned much of its attention to weather reports concerning tropical storm <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON>, which was near the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast and forcing evacuations from oil rigs on land and in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The storm was described as moving slowly and erratically away from land. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew into and out of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in a matter of hours, taking time to tell the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> he wanted to campaign on a crystal-clear statement of party principles. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said again Monday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is intentionally playing coy on his selection of a running mate in order to build interest in a convention that promises no other surprises. `` He will have a maximum television audience. I'm for doing anything that will help build up a TV audience,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he will withhold his choice until the last day of the convention, and his only comment Monday was, `` Still working on it.'' He was equally uninformative at a family dinner Sunday night in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he had spent the weekend. `` We went around the table last night at dinner. Some popped off and argued. I sat silent, like a sphinx,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. According to his oldest son, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` We bombarded him at dinner. Nothing. No expression on his face.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, warming to his role as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigner, boasted of the accomplishments of the past seven years of Republican control of the White House, though he stayed away from the specifics of the Bush-Dukakis match-up in a speech to the nation's governors in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. `` Our states, like our citizens, have known the blessings of the longest peacetime economic expansion on record,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` In the last seven and one-half years, we have broken the federal government of its compulsion to control every breath the states take.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> are not scheduled to appear together at next week's convention, but the vice president said a joint airport appearance was possible on the second day of the meeting. `` I think the grand planners are working on it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Such a joint appearance `` would be good for me. ... There are no questions on where the president stands on his support for me _ strong.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stepped to center stage in the city that will host his nomination, trailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the polls the week before the GOP convention opens. He made an unusual appearance for a nominee-to-be _ speaking in person to the platform committee about what he wants in the document to be adopted here next week. He dismissed the Democrats' platform, adopted last month in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, as a `` document of deceit.'' And he told the platform committee, `` We need to make this campaign a plan for the future, a statement of solutions, not an exercise in evasion. We should make our principles and our policies crystal clear to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' He missed no opportunity to attack <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He's the stealth candidate,'' the vice president said. `` For while he ca n't decide about the stealth bomber, he favors instead stealth policies _ they can be neither seen nor heard. ... His campaign jets from place to place, but no issues show up on the radar screen. `` Their nominee spoke for 50 minutes in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and failed to mention the most important issue of our time: how to make the world a safer place,'' he added. The stealth bomber is a supersecret craft designed to evade detection. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he supports development of the bomber but would not commit to deploying the craft until he saw how well it would operate. Touring the Superdome where he will receive the party's nomination next week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denied that he was engaging in negative campaigning `` No, no ... very positive,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters. But he did say, `` We've got to get these differences in focus,'' as he toured a large room where teen-agers were making signs for the convention. Then, refering to the Democratic convention _ where he was a frequent target _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` That was negative campaigning.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a brown-bag lunch _ turkey sandwich and potato chips _ with the construction workers who are turning the giant football arena into a political hall. `` This is my life, man, and I tell you it's looking great,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as he looked around the mostly empty building. Members of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Contests spent Monday trying to resolve challenges to as many as 39 of the 48 delegates from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the primary there, but supporters of television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> made a run at taking over the party machinery. Regardless who is seated, the delegates must vote for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation to prohibit political contributions for state and local campaigns from being used for a federal race _ a step critics say amounts to protection for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The measure goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on a voice vote.

 The city will not enforce a 1 a.m. curfew at most parks this summer to prevent violence similar to a weekend riot that left 38 people injured, officials said Monday. `` The weather is very hot. The beaches are closed. People are really angry about -LRB- the curfew -RRB-,'' Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said of the confrontation early Sunday in Tompkins Square Park on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Lower East Side <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> also blamed `` provocateurs,'' saying they incited the violence by throwing bottles and fireworks at police. `` There are people looking for confrontation. ... And if they take on a cop, it's at their peril,'' he said. Four hundred fifty police officers tangled with 250 demonstrators who gathered in the street outside <LOCATION> Tompkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> to protest its closing. Witnesses charged that protesters and bystanders were beaten without cause. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said police tried to close the park at the request of residents who complained of loud music and drug dealing. Neither <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> would say if officers used undue force. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said news footage of officers beating people had to be viewed in context. `` I do n't know of any extreme use of force,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. But the <ORGANIZATION> Civilain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complaint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said it had received 23 complaints about police conduct at the riot. One alleged victim had a broken finger, three had cuts that needed stitches, 14 had bruises they said were caused by nightsticks and five said they were shoved or pushed, said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>, the board's executive director. `` If there was extreme use of force, I urge those people to come forward, and their complaints will be investigated,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. Even if officers were attacked, he said, `` provocation is not a defense to the illegal use of force.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> aides distributed photocopies of flyers at a news conference said to have been handed out by demonstrators. One warned landlords around Tompkins Square that if the curfew were enforced `` our organization will destroy your homes''; another was bordered with drawings of guns and explosives. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> called them the work of `` provocateurs,'' and <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said `` professional demonstrators'' were involved. Curfews at two parks, one in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> and one on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s East Side, will still be enforced to combat drug dealing, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A remote-controlled bomb exploded on a road Monday amid the motorcade of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, shattering the window of his wife's car but causing no injuries. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, part of whose visit to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> was to express <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for this South American nation's anti-drug efforts, said he `` will not be intimidated ... the war against drugs will be won.'' The Bolivian government blamed cocaine traffickers for the assassination attempt on the outskirts of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, and for an earlier bombing Monday at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commissary in the capital city. No injuries were reported but the commissary door was damaged in that explosion, which happened at 6:30 a.m. Speaking at a news conference Monday afternoon, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> praised the <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> government's fight against narcotics. `` When the history of the war against narcotics is written, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> will rank high. Millions who are young, still more millions not yet born will owe you a priceless debt of gratitude,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. He told reporters, `` We will not be intimidated by the tactic of using violence to try to scare government officials. The war against drugs will be won and we will not be deterred.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> described the bombing as `` anti-democratic and against human decency. ... The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports and will continue to support <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s strenuous efforts to combat cocaine trafficking.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said a team of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> security agents will fly to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> Tuesday to help investigate the bombings. Police said the bomb, which they believe was several sticks of dynamite, was set off by someone on a grassy hill overlooking the road seconds after <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s car had passed. At the time of the blast, about 9:20 a.m., dozens of people were on the hill watching the 11-car motorcade travel from the airport to the city. Three cars were damaged, including one in which <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, was traveling. The explosion, witnessed by this reporter from a vantage point several cars behind the official motorcade, blew a hole in the road and scattered chunks of pavement, rocks and dirt over a wide area. Afterward, dozens of police officers hurriedly sealed off the road and climbed a nearby hill to search for the bombers. They found a wire they said had been used to detonate the bomb. In a statement released at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Terrorist tactics, such as used against Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and his motorcade in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> today, are always repugnant.'' `` Thankfully, the secretary's party was not injured, but the fact remains that an attack on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials can not be tolerated. We ask the government of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> to bring those responsible to justice,'' he said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was riding in the first few cars of the motorcade, apart from his wife. Mrs. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was in the first car that was damaged, medical personnel were in the second, and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> was in the third, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The bomb, which exploded between the sixth and seventh cars, smashed windows and blew tires on the three damaged cars. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had been scheduled to go the Hotel La Paz but instead was rushed directly to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, which was cordoned off by police and had sharpshooters dispatched to the roof. The rest of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s schedule was unchanged, Ms. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. No claim of responsibility was made, but Foreign Minister <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedregal </PERSON> said both bombings were the work of cocaine dealers. <PERSON> Bedregal </PERSON> was riding in <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s car with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy charge d'affaires <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told a group of government officials and business leaders in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> that `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as the biggest consumer of drugs in the world, has a special responsibility in this battle.'' He listed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-drug efforts and then noted passage of a law here that declares 90 percent of coca plants illegal and imposes stiff penalties on cocaine producers and traffickers. `` The pirates and warlords of the drug business have fought you at every step, with money, intimidation and violence,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told the gathering. `` But there can be no question that <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> has made the right choice. We salute you for that choice.'' Active <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cooperation with government efforts to fight the drug trade has angered the 350,000 farmers _ from among <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s 6.7 million population _ who depend on coca leaf farming and cocaine production for a living They say the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Bolivian governments are not doing enough to assist in the transition to other crops. The issue of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid topped the agenda in <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s meetings here, Planning Minister <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozada </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will revise its financial commitments here and speed up disbursements of funds already approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he reported. On Monday evening, the secretary flew to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, 420 miles east of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, to meet former military strongman <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> before continuing on to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> now reads the nationalist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The 67-year-old <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has been secretary of state since 1982. He has traveled widely during that time but has never been attacked before. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, on a 10-day, nine-country Latin American tour aimed at gaining support for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies, flew to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. His tour began Aug. 1 in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and is scheduled to end Wednesday in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>.

 Fireworks exploded in the night sky over <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> early Tuesday and jubilant Iraqis fired thousands of bullets into the air to celebrate `` the great victory'' over <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The celebration came after <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> announced in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Monday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had agreed to a cease-fire in their eight-year-old war. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said the cease-fire would start Aug. 20 and peace negotiations would take place five days later. Shortly after midnight, government television called on Iraqis `` to celebrate the great victory achieved by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'' on `` the greatest day of all.'' It announced a tree-day period of celebration. The war has killed or wounded about 1 million people and cost both countries billions of dollars. Iraqis danced on pickup trucks and waved palm leaves from the windows of cars driving through <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> as tracer bullets and flares flashed overhead. `` The war is over. Victory for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>,'' said a man at the entrance to the <PERSON> Al-Rashid </PERSON> hotel as he looked up at the fireworks. `` The war is over, praise be to God,'' said a woman beside him. `` Here, take this'' a security man said, offering a reporter an automatic rifle. The guard then fired the rifle into the sky, laughing with other security men across the street who unleashed scores of rounds from a machine gun. Not all of the bullets went skyward. A car in the Al-Rashid parking lot had a bullet hole in the hood. Children scampered through the streets collecting cartridges.

<TEXT>
 The owners of a boarding house where <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> wrote his first plays agreed Monday to give preservationists a chance to save the building by moving it to another location. The owners wanted to raze the house, built around 1860, to make way for a summer home, but the state won a temporary injunction blocking the demolition. The agreement, which still must be formally presented to the court, `` gives everybody at least something of what they want,'' said state Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Russ </PERSON>, representing the state <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The owners gave the state until January to decide whether the 1 -LCB- - story building can be moved, and until March 1, 1989 to remove the building from its site on a sandy stretch of the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in southeastern <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Moukawsher </PERSON>, attorney for the four owners, said the house is run-down and that it would have been too much of a burden to restore it. <PERSON> Moukawsher </PERSON> had argued that the house, built in Carpenter Gothic style, was only of minor historical significance and that its importance had been exaggerated. The <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> family's summer home, <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cristo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cottage </ORGANIZATION>, is located only a block away from the boarding house and is listed as a National Historic Landmark. The boarding house could not receive that designation because of its historical similarity to the cottage, <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> said. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> was convalescing from tuberculosis when he was taken on as a winter guest at the boarding house in 1913-14, while the rest of his family traveled on a theater tour. During that time, he produced four one-act plays that were incorporated into his first published work, `` Thirst and Other One Act Plays,'' and his first full-length play, `` Bread and Butter,'' said historic preservationists. While moving the house would strip it of some of its historical significance, it still would be the building where <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> began his career as a dramatist, <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> said. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, who died in 1953, won four Pulitzer Prizes for his plays and the Nobel Prize in literature. The agreement was reached on the same day a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing was set on whether the injunction should remain in effect pending a trial. <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> conceded that the state would not have been able to prevent the home's ultimate destruction if a trial had been held.

<DATELINE>EIGHTY EIGHT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This tiny town's number came up Monday _ 8-8-88 _ and visitors crowded in from around the country, calls came in from around the world and the post office was besieged with thousands and thousands of letters. `` You've got to think of your eight lingo on a day like today,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> of nearby Bowling Green, whose favorite number is eight. `` I bought an eight-pack of beer, and I'm having a great time, g-r-e-i-g-h-t.'' Visitors to the southwestern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> town 8.8 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> could buy sandwiches or an RC Cola-moon pie combination for 88 cents at the 88 Market under a banner that read `` Happy Birthday Eighty Eight, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>'' `` It's crazy,'' said the market's owner, <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> `` It's just unbelievable. The world's gone crazy.'' Capping the celebration was the 8:08 p.m. wedding of <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Accardo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhlbeier </PERSON> of Casper, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, on the eighth step of the <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>. About 500 well-wishers, most of them residents or tourists, cheered when the couple said `` I do'' and then climbed into a hot air balloon tethered across the street from the church and became airborne for the toss of the bouquet of eight white roses. `` 8-8 of 88 will be absolutely branded in my mind,'' said <PERSON> Accardo </PERSON>, 29. `` The people here have been fantastic.'' `` Our marriage is magical. It's just the icing on the cake and I'm telling you it's thick icing,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Accardo </PERSON>, 34. `` The biggest part of it is the people of Eighty Eight. The town has been incredible. You walk into town and you're part of the family.'' Residents gave the couple a wedding cake with an `` 88'' perched on top and a reception for about 600. Ms. <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> said she went to bed in the wee hours after Sunday's preliminary celebration and got about two hours' sleep before the telephone started ringing. Calls came in from more than 150 radio stations across the country, as well as stations in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, wanting interviews. `` I guess every state has contacted us at this time,'' she said. She said she was happy and excited, `` but I'm exhausted. I enjoyed my little store the way it was.'' She made change for <PERSON> R.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, who made out a check to the 88 Market for $ 8.88 for a T-shirt, which was actually $ 6.29. Ms. <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>'s business in Eighty Eight caps and T-shirts boomed Monday, as did the traffic at a mobile temporary post office set up across the highway. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleet </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service's area manager, said the post office had handled 25,000 pieces of mail Monday for people wanting the EIGHTY-EIGHT 8-8-88 cancellation. `` We've had people come in here from all over the country,'' he said. `` It's really amazing the number of people that have been here.'' <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, Eighty Eight postmistress, said on an average day the town handles 100 pieces of mail. `` I've been here 31 years, and I've never seen anything like this,'' she said. `` It's really something.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning, America'' broadcast a segment of Monday's show from this small farming community of 150 residents They interviewed eight people. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> questioned the reasoning for setting the parade, with 88-year-old Eighty Eight resident <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Billingsley </PERSON> leading in a red sports car, on Sunday. `` How could they possibly do that?''

 Fireworks exploded in the night sky over <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> early Tuesday and jubilant Iraqis fired thousands of bullets into the air to celebrate `` the great victory'' over <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The celebration came after <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> announced in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Monday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had agreed to a cease-fire in their eight-year-old war. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said the cease-fire would start Aug. 20 and peace negotiations would take place five days later. Shortly after midnight, government television called on Iraqis `` to celebrate the great victory achieved by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'' on `` the greatest day of all.'' It announced a three-day period of celebration. The war has killed about 1 million people and cost each country billions of dollars. Iraqis danced on pickup trucks and waved palm leaves from the windows of cars driving through <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> as tracer bullets and flares flashed overhead. `` The war is over. Victory for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>,'' said a man at the entrance to the <PERSON> Al-Rashid </PERSON> hotel as he looked up at the fireworks. `` The war is over, praise be to God,'' said a woman beside him. `` Here, take this'' a security man said, offering a reporter an automatic rifle. The guard then fired the rifle into the sky, laughing with other security men across the street who unleashed scores of rounds from a machine gun. Not all of the bullets went skyward. A car in the Al-Rashid parking lot had a bullet hole in the hood. Children scampered through the streets collecting cartridges.

 The owners of 1988 passenger vans and large sedans are likely to have fewer damage claims and lower repair bills, while those who own sports cars and some compact cars may not be as lucky, according to an insurance industry report. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an insurance research group, examined both the frequency of insurance collision claims and the average amount of the claim for 60 new cars that had repairs paid through insurance policies during the first nine months of the 1988 model year. `` Even among cars of the same size class and body style there were large variations in results,'' the insurance group said. But it said that in general, larger cars had a better collision loss record than smaller vehicles.

The former chemical dump that forced hundreds of families from their homes has been fenced off and surrounded with clay and plastic liners to prevent chemicals from leaking into groundwater.

<HEAD>Video Publishing Increase as Companies Turn to Video Publishing</HEAD>

 As the TV generation comes of age, more companies are turning to video magazines, brochures, catalogues and annual reports to get their message across with sound, sight and action. `` It's very much a growing trend ... We're in the television generation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleyman </PERSON>. The group's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> members, who operate corporate video efforts, have grown from 1,600 to 9,000 since 1978. Corporate video outlays reached $ 5.5 billion in 1987, up from $ 1.1 billion in 1980, according to a recent study, <PERSON> Kleyman </PERSON> said. Using telegenic visuals, sharp graphics and background music, video publications are becoming the way to reach teens and adults who prefer the tube. Some of the slickly produced videos are televised companions of printed media. Others stand alone or supplement face-to-face meetings. `` Little by little younger employees are asking for more things on video,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which began `` Newsline,'' a TV show for staffers, in 1984. `` The generation that has grown up on television expects to get their information quickly and on the tube.'' Much like a company newspaper, the magazine-format show features segments on gaining customers, how to safely use torches when cutting gas lines, and how gas delivery to some customers was curtailed during a winter shortage. Programs are produced four times yearly, for $ 20,000 to $ 25,000 each. The utility's 9,500 employees view them at 200 sites throughout the company. Some take videocassettes home to watch, <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> produces its own videos to welcome new workers, show corporate policyholders how to reduce accidents, and help claims adjusters standardize estimates. This year some agents are visiting families with a new life insurance video they can play on home recorders. `` He'll pop the video in the VCR and it will show how the product can really benefit them,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> assistant vice president <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>. `` It's an emotional product that we're selling The use of emotions can help people understand the importance of the product to their family's livelihood.'' Video publishing also is moving into stockholder meetings. Instead of speeches from top executives, some corporations show a company-produced video before taking questions from the floor, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobgood </PERSON>, who prepares corporate annual reports. `` Three years ago I was n't doing any video work,'' said <PERSON> Hobgood </PERSON>, who expects to produce five to six annual report videos this year. `` People will watch a 10 or 12 minute video. You may or may not be able to get them to read the same thing on paper.'' Since companies must file printed reports with government agencies, <PERSON> Hobgood </PERSON> does n't see television replacing print. Cost and portabability are other print advantages. `` I do n't see them replacing print,'' said <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Uttal-Gold </PERSON>, who has produced corporate videos for five years. Unlike print, she said, people `` ca n't take the video home.'' `` There's still a lot of resistance,'' from some corporations, she said. `` They do n't want to spend that kind of money and they do n't think people are going to view it.'' Still, video uses are growing as a TV generation finds new applications for its favorite medium. <LOCATION> Redlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, produced a video `` windshield tour'' of itself when officials presented a $ 7 million municipal bond issue to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firms setting the city's credit rating last Spring `` Normally it is done verbally and maybe with some flip charts or slides showing the city or project that's going to be financed,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> of the firm organizing the bond issue. Video publishing has natural advantages for some topics and audiences, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, executive producer of `` Business Television Report,'' a quarterly videocassette magazine for television industry executives. `` We cover the business of television on television,'' said <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The video magazine is sent on cassettes to targeted industry leaders and distributed by satellite to TV stations. Several printed trade magazines cover the television business. But <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> editor, started the video magazine last Autumn because he `` wondered why the television industry did not use the power and impact of its own medium to report on itself.'' The television magazine shows examples of programs and screens new technologies, along with on-camera interviews. Also included are commercials geared for TV executives; such as the Nickelodeon cable channel and video equipment makers. Other video publishing includes colleges sending tapes to high schools to recruit students and companies issuing video catalogues of wares. Hardware stores and supermarkets screen videos in their aisles to demonstrate how products are used. Video publishing is growing `` simply because organizations understand they have to communicate in ways that people are comfortable being communicated with,'' said <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothenberg </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> journalism professor. `` It's a format people are used to seeing. It's visual.'' Video costs are steep compared to print. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said one production of `` Newsline'' costs more than a year of the utility's employee magazine. Production costs are going down, but video producers have found they ca n't sacrifice quality to save money. `` I do n't think you can go cheap and have a good result,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Rothenberg </PERSON>. `` People do n't want to see home movies. They want to see something like what they see on television.''

 If not for a bunch of guys sitting around a bar in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> a few years ago, there would be no `` Roseanne'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> this coming season. Well, maybe it is n't world peace, but it has changed the life of comedian <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> who will star as the wisecracking `` domestic goddess'' in the half-hour comedy that might just be <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s best bet for a new season hit. `` I was a cocktail waitress. My customers encouraged me to go down to this comedy club. I did n't know it was there. So I went down there and watched everybody,'' she said. A year later she had written five minutes' worth of material that led her to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> where was called from the secondary stage at The Comedy Store to main room and discovered by comedy producer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlatter </PERSON>. The routine at the root of this frenzy of success was described by <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> for a group of television critics: `` I go, ` Hi, I'm a housewife, domestic goddess, then I tell jokes about my kids and then I tell jokes about my husband and then I get off.'' Her remarkable poise as a woman busting into a man's standup-comic world came from the `` back-and-forthing'' with the boys in the bar `` If those guys had n't laughed, I probably would n't be doin' this now. She is pressed on just what one-liners so impressed cocktail purchasers that they would encourage her to go pro. `` Most of it is so filthy, you could n't print it,'' she says. Well, OK. `` This guy goes, ` Do you know any married women that do n't want to get a divorce but want to have an affair with a married guy who'll treat'em real good and spend a lot of money on'em and make love a lot and all this stuff? And I go _ ` Yeah. Your wife.''' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>'s hapless and seemingly worthless husband is the butt of many of her jokes, but in real life <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Pentland </PERSON> was an early supporter of her career, helping develop her material. He is a writer and likely sometime performer on the sitcom, scheduled to debut probably in November. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> -LRB- `` Raising Arizona'' -RRB- plays her TV husband. `` My real husband is like a lot more bizarre than my character husband,'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said. `` He's very funny. He's like the funniest person I ever knew my whole life, and he's very bizarre and he does n't have any respect for anything, and he's very much an anarchist.'' They met when she was living in a commune in the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and `` he had the only toilet in the county'' since he worked as the night manager at a motel. `` We were really hippy people.'' `` Me and him went to this club the first time I ever went down there. We sat there together and we were both like really appalled at what they were saying on stage and like what's happened to comedy?' All the `` pig jokes about women'' convinced the two of them that <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> should take on the comedy establishment and offer `` the other side.'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>'s humor is more than yocks. It has a political, working-class edge that will likely find its way into the sitcom. She does n't like the sitcom moms offered to the TV public so far. `` You're just a working stiff and this is your job. I wish people would stop thinking it was destiny and start thinking it's a job. `` You try to keep everything light and funny as you can because there's no other way to survive being a working-class person without any money.'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said she loves <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> because `` she's so real and she seems like your neighbor and somebody you'd like to know.'' But she says she was baffled by the popularity of the old `` I Love Lucy'' show. `` I like <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> but I hated that show, because she has to beg her husband for five bucks and he spanks her ... I never ever understood that even as a little girl.'' <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramden </PERSON> on `` The Honeymooners'' are her favorites, ``'cause you know they love each other and they're just picking at each other, which is kind of the thing I want on our show, rather than ` Married ... with Children' and that mean thing. I just want to like this nice lady that's funny and has this edge, which is how I see myself.''

 Elsewhere in television: FROM THE `` IT'S A JOKE'' FILE _ <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> is still steamed about the potshots that <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> has taken at him since the megaphone incident a couple of years ago. At a recent news conference, <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> even impuned <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s masculinity for not doing the `` guys'' thing and calling up and apologizing. `` I do n't expect <PERSON> David </PERSON> to do a mea culpa on the air But I would have thought he'd be enough of a man to pick up the phone and say, ` It's gotten out of hand, I'm sorry.' That has n't happened. I'm not asking for it to happen. I'm really not. I guess what I'm saying is the fact that it has n't happened tells me a lot about the guy.'' In an interview last year, <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> suggested forming a support group to meet in a church basement to help <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> get over his distress. The feud stems from the `` Today'' show's prime-time special in 1986 when <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> shouted out his window with a megaphone as `` Today'' was taping. <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> thought it was unprofessional. <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> maintains he was invited by the show's producer to pull such a prank, but someone apparently did n't warn <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Nineteen years ago a contingent of <LOCATION> Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Krishnas </LOCATION> founded a community in the Appalachians, and their Palace of <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> became a big tourist attraction. In recent years, their enclave also drew its share of trouble.

<TEXT>
 They flocked to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s hill country to build their <PERSON> Hare </PERSON> <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> community, seeking peace and a higher consciousness. Now there's been talk of demons whirling in the upper air to menace their faith. More tangible threats have bedeviled the community below: a murder a year ago, a mysterious death last spring, arson, lawsuits, harassment by dissidents, excommunication by the larger <PERSON> Hare </PERSON> <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> movement, ugly accusations of child molestation and abuse, even an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> `` raid.'' Through it all, the remnant of adherents at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vrindaban </LOCATION>, down to 150 to 300 from perhaps twice that strength several years ago, is carrying on. Whatever was wrong in their community in the past, the faithful say, has been straightened out, and they place their hopes for the future in their children _ children whose upbringing is admittedly `` different.'' A 7-year-old worries about the afterlife. `` He asked me, ` If you think of Godhead when you die, do you get to Godhead?''' his spiritual teacher says. The boy had special reasons to wonder. His father's body, charred, a bullet wound in its head, the remains gnawed by his own pit bulls, was found near <LOCATION> Krishna </LOCATION> property this spring. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordenkircher </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff, wo n't say that <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Schenker </PERSON> was murdered. He says: `` What we have is a male adult who apparently shot himself in the head, set himself on fire and then threw the gun away. Like everything at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vrindaban </LOCATION>, this case is very suspicious and bizarre.'' In 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> seized truckloads of computers, financial records and sports souvenirs the Krishnas were selling, but never filed charges and returned most of the goods. New Vrindaban, named after a holy town in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, was founded 19 years ago. Here the devotees built their `` Palace of Gold,'' a dazzling little shrine that once drew some 250,000 tourists a year. There are far fewer now. The remaining believers live below and beyond the hilltop shrine, scattered in the valleys and ridges in mostly make-do houses. The community was rocked by formal charges against two ashram teachers that they sexually abused their wards. A former member claims in a court deposition that New Vrindaban leaders ignored the sexual molestation of her son, even told her it would advance the youngster spiritually. Other former members say the community's leader, <PERSON> Kirtanananda </PERSON> <PERSON> Swami </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhaktipada </PERSON>, forced them into childhood marriages. They tell of beatings and other abuses. It was when these and other troubles thickened that <PERSON> Bhaktipada </PERSON> _ a former <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student and the son of a Baptist minister _ spoke of the demons trying to bring misfortune on the Palace of Gold. The Krishnas have made changes. New ashram leaders have been brought in. Some <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> children now attend public schools. And community teachers have been trained to spot sexual abuse. But child molestation charges still are pending against one former ashram teacher, <PERSON> Schenker </PERSON>'s death is unsolved, one swami still must stand trial on charges he killed a devotee who turned against the sect, and a two-year federal investigation of the community continues. Devotees are weary. `` I feel like an animal in the zoo,'' complains <PERSON> Gopi </PERSON>, an 18-year-old who moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vrindaban </LOCATION> with her parents when she was 12. She left once, but soon returned. `` This is my religion. This is what I believe, my home,'' she says. The Krishnas believe in reincarnation, the level of each succeeding life determined by spiritual attainments and a higher consciousness. They are vegetarians and allow no drugs, illicit sex or gambling. Menial tasks are considered acts of devotion when performed in the name of <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> _ the <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> who rewards and punishes for the deeds of past lives. <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> controls destiny. <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> is all.

 `` I was crazy and I was lazy until I offered a daisy to <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON>, with love and devotion ...'' <PERSON> Hari </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirtan </PERSON> croons off-key as he plunks on the piano, 10-year-old fingers stretching to hit the right keys. About 30 children live in the ashram, a long building with rustic bedrooms surrounding a central hall large enough to roller-skate in. Each of six teachers cares for a half-dozen children, boys on the right, girls on the left. Their parents work in the community or raise money on the outside. The children rise early for a 5 a.m., two-hour worship service at the gold embellished temple next door, men on the right, women on the left. Small boys jump wildly through the incense to the rhythm of drums and cymbals, ponytails flying, saffron robes riding high above white athletic socks. Small girls in long skirts and scarves wind through the chanting, dancing crowd with flowers or small flaming lamps cradled in their hands. They attend school -LRB- either <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> or public -RRB-, eat vegetarian meals, sing religious songs and play. They look happy. They look healthy. Former devotees have told of a darker side to ashram life. <PERSON> Kanka </PERSON> <PERSON> Dasi </PERSON>, her <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> name, contends her 12-year-old boy told her in 1986 that his ashram teachers sexually molested him for five years. She testified in a court deposition that she told <PERSON> Bhaktipada </PERSON> about the abuse. `` He became angry,'' <PERSON> Kanka </PERSON> testified. `` He said I was just a stupid woman _ how much sex have I had in my life? And I told him that it did n't compare, that two consenting adults and a child being molested by a teacher are two different things and it's very demonic.'' <PERSON> Kanka </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bhaktipada </PERSON> threatened to expel anyone who supported the allegations. Other parents did nothing, she said. <PERSON> Kanka </PERSON> told her story in a lengthy deposition given for <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, a former devotee who left her children with their father at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vrindaban </LOCATION> two years ago and now is trying to get them back. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>' lawyers filed depositions from several former adherents who told stories of intimidation, beatings, filth and sexual abuse. According to <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> records, <PERSON> Kanka </PERSON> said she was discouraged from being too close with her child lest it interfere with his spiritual development. She left with her son, while the accused teachers remained in the ashram until the county prosecutor's office filed charges against them. Teacher's aide <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Difrancisco </PERSON>, known as `` Lalita'' and 21 at the time, pleaded guilty to third-degree sexual assault and served six months in a state correctional center. Headmaster <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> fled the country rather than face a criminal charge, authorities said.

 But in the off-season, <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> reports some of the highest unemployment rates in the nation. `` We have a terrible depression every year,'' <PERSON> Lorenzen </PERSON> says. In January, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s unemployment rate hit 15.8 percent, more than double the national rate, while just 80 miles to the southeast <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> had a 4.4 jobless rate. `` The spring is the slowest time for us,'' says <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, who operates an inn in Speculator. `` Between the bugs and the mud we have a lot of trouble convincing anyone to come up here in the spring, partly because we do n't believe it ourselves.'' Summer eases the job pinch. By the Fourth of July, <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has virtually full employment. When the tourists are not around, everything stops. The two modest movie theaters shut down. Restaurants and hotels close. And highway workers stop maintaining the back roads where no one lives. To lure winter visitors to the area, which usually gets about 150 inches of snow, the local people created 750 miles of trails for snowmobiles. `` The snowmobiler is the largest contributor to our wintertime economy. Usually they come in at least overnight and often stay a Friday and Saturday night while the skiers and ice fishermen are day-trippers,'' <PERSON> Lorenzen </PERSON> says. A furniture maker employs about 20 people in <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, a lumbering operation over in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> keeps about 30 people working and the county has a work force of about 40 people. The lack of economic opportunity forces the children to leave home when they grow up. `` They can make a living here, but if they want a career, to be a doctor or a lawyer, they have to move away,'' says <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Bancroft </PERSON>, who has had five of her children leave the county when they grew up. About the only way young people can afford to stay in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is to follow their father's footsteps. Sheriff <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> followed his father into law enforcement, and he can rattle off several examples of sons who took their father's place at garages, contracting and other jobs around the county. While the forces of nature provide local residents with what economic base they have, it also works to isolate them. Officials have been forced to shut down one-third of the runway at the county's only airport because the tops of pine trees in the dense forest are intruding into the flight path. State officials have said it would take an amendment to the state Constitution to cut the trees to allow full use of the runway. There has been talk of town house and condominium developments going up in Speculator and Inlet. Those proposals can generate heated arguments between people who resent the zoning restrictions for holding back the local economy and folks who worry about preserving the wilderness. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, who moved his family to Speculator nine years ago from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, says he's not worried about development turning Speculator into the kind of suburban sprawl common to so many other communities. `` I moved here from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> so I would not have to hear somebody else's john flush,'' says <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>. `` We are so far away from any saturation point.'' Some conveniences taken for granted most places are not to be had in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` We have to go out of town for our haircuts,'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> says. `` There are no bagels, and it took my wife and mother-in-law some time to get used to the 120-mile round-trip to the mall. <PERSON> Lorenzen </PERSON> says `` it's a myth'' that living in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is inexpensive. `` We have to truck everything in here. Food is higher. Gas is higher. People try to do their shopping outside.'' `` You do try to fix the little things when you can, rather than call a serviceman,'' says <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, who still drives the <ORGANIZATION> Chevy </ORGANIZATION> pickup truck his father bought new 21 years ago. There are only 892 more people living in the entire county now than there were in 1925, and the population is not expected to reach 6,000 for the next two decades. <PERSON> Lorenzen </PERSON>, who moved to the shore of <LOCATION> Piseco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> 19 years ago, says, `` Actually it's a very fine bit of Americana that is slipping away. A lot of business is carried on on just a handshake and trust. We do n't have to lock our cars. It's an unusual bit of Americana.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ For 16 days they held out against the Japanese invasion force, some 1,200 civilians fighting alongside 449 Marines, 68 sailors and six <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> men. All were either killed or captured when <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> fell on Dec. 23, 1941. A momument to the military men was erected shortly after the war, but it was not until this summer that the civilian defenders got their monument. Many returned to <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> for the dedication, some for the first time since the war.

 Palm trees and evergreens grow where once there was only ironwood brush. The once-countless rats and gooney birds are gone, the coral runway has been replaced. `` It's strange, everything looks so different that walking around here, looking at the monuments and the old rusted-out guns, it's almost like looking at someone else's life, like it never happened to me,'' says <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodds </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, a retired radio and television broadcaster. <PERSON> Dodds </PERSON> was a 22-year-old civilian construction worker captured when the Japanese invaded this remote tropical atoll in late 1941. He was one of the defenders of <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> who recently returned for a dedication of a monument in honor of the civilians who fought alongside the soldiers, sailors and Marines, all of whom were either killed or captured. A memorial to the Marines was erected shortly after the war. But the civilians _ including construction workers building military installations and others who worked for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> _ got little credit. It was 1981 before they were deemed eligible for veterans' benefits, and for 47 years there was no official monument to them. The dedication ceremony drew 42 civilian defenders, 14 military men, and about about 100 family members. For many of them, the reunion June 13-16 was their first visit to the island since the war. <PERSON> Ival </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Milbourn </PERSON>, 64, a retired construction contractor who lives in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, still has occasional nightmares about his war experiences. By bringing his wife, two sons and his 85-year-old father to the reunion, he hoped to put some of the old ghosts to rest. `` This has been a 47-year-dream,'' <PERSON> Milbourn </PERSON> said as he looked over the post he manned on the day of the first attack on Dec. 8, 1941. `` I just ca n't explain how I feel, but by having my family here I feel like they understand why I'm the way I am, why I did the things I did.'' <PERSON> Milbourn </PERSON> was 18 years old and a private in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> when he landed on Wake in late 1941. He still recalls the details of that first attack, only hours after the Japanese struck <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Wake is west of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dateline </ORGANIZATION>, so it was the next day there. `` We were n't prepared at all,'' says <PERSON> Milbourn </PERSON>, who manned a 3-inch anti-aircraft gun. `` We had n't even filled the first sandbag. We ran to our positions and trained right on those planes, but we were expecting reinforcements and we thought they might be our own guys.'' The next 16 days were a blur of daily bombing raids, thwarted invasions and close-fought battles. The outnumbered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops shot down 21 Japanese planes and sank at least two destroyers with outmoded weapons salvaged from warships from World War I. But with no reinforcements and little ammunition, they surrendered to the Japanese on Dec. 23, 1941. `` We were among the last Marines to get the order to surrender,'' <PERSON> Milbourn </PERSON> recalls, `` and when we were told to give up our guns, well, that was the first time we ever told an <ORGANIZATION> NCO </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- non-commissioned officer -RRB- ` up your bucket' because we'd been told the Japanese take no prisoners.'' The Americans were ordered to strip and march down to the old airstrip, where a ring of machine guns awaited. There they were tied up and ordered to crouch in the middle of the circle. `` We were scared and praying and crying and everything else,'' <PERSON> Milbourn </PERSON> says. `` Then at the last minute, they took the guns down, because they learned there were civilians among us.'' The Americans _ 449 <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, 68 sailors, six <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> men and 1,200 civilians _ were left on the airstrip overnight, still naked and tightly bound. The next day they were each given a small piece of bread and a drink of gasoline-tainted water. It was Dec. 25, 1941. `` That was our Christmas dinner, and we had no idea how much worse it would get,'' <PERSON> Milbourn </PERSON> recalls. Most of the prisoners were eventually transferred by boat to prison camps in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Several prisoners were beheaded and all were poorly fed along the way. The Japanese kept 98 civilians on the island as slave labor. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> `` Chick'' <PERSON> Bamford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texarkana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, lied about his age to join the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> when he was 15 years old, so he had not even turned 20 when he was released from prison camp in September 1945, after the Japanese surrender. `` I got the name ` Chick' in boot camp because I was such a kid,'' says <PERSON> Bamford </PERSON>. `` In prison camp the older guys looked out for me, tried to get me food, because I was in my growing years.'' Across the atoll, the survivors, many of whom had n't seen each other since they were liberated from through all those years in the prison camps, well, it just makes you happy to be alive.'' Of the Americans, 120 were killed in the fighting and 231 died in captivity. The 98 civilians kept on Wake were executed on Oct. 7, 1943. They left behind a reminder of their plight: a large coral boulder, painstakingly hand-carved with their initials and the still-legible message that reads `` 98 <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> PW -LRB- for prisoners of war -RRB- 5-10-43.'' Five months later, they were machine-gunned on the beach in retaliation for a devastating American air strike the day before. The memory of those civilians and how they died has haunted many of the survivors. `` When I heard about this trip I thought I was n't sure I wanted to go, I did n't know what kind of memories it would bring,'' said <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, 67, now credit manager of a hospital in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The execution of the civilians `` affected me so profoundly that I could n't sleep for weeks after hearing about it. I thought it was a religious duty that I should come back.''

 You wo n't find <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, on any map. But you wo n't come across many in these parts who do n't know of <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> and its `` founder,'' <PERSON> Cloyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>. `` I guess everyone knows about me,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> says, hands thrust in the pockets of his worn overalls. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> is proprietor of a ramshackle general store on a dirt road 7 miles north of <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>. A sign outside reads: <PERSON> WEBSTER </PERSON> MICHIGAN OPEN 7. TO 10 P.M. CLOSED SUNDAYS He has no post office in his store, but he's so well-known locally that mail addressed to <LOCATION> Webster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, reaches him. Since first setting up shop here in 1932, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> has been collecting derelict automobiles and gadgets, pop bottles and hubcaps, batteries and milk jugs, toasters and sewing machines, all kinds of litter that together comprise something of a scrapbook of the 20th century. Indeed, a trip to <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> throws the visitor into a time warp, back to the days of <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> thermometers and 5-cent soda pop. <PERSON> Cloyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, a youthful-looking 70-year-old pack rat, storekeeper, cobbler, mechanic, storyteller, artist, husband and father. Surrounded by dairy farms that dot the rolling hills of west-central <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, some might call <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s 27 acres a junkyard. But among the rusting hulks of 1930s and'40s automobiles are some treasures. `` Sure, I know some of these things are worth a lot,'' he says. `` And I sell some of'em.'' He rummages through a box full of antique bottles. `` Here's one of them old Dr Pepper bottles. Betcha never seen one of them before.'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> will sell you anything you want. But if you ca n't pay, he's been known to make a deal. Cut him some wood, and he'll fix a battery free of charge. Batteries are his specialty. But, he says, he can fix just about anything `` if I can get the part.'' Chances are, he has it already. Even more remarkably, he knows where it is. `` Inventory? I keep it all up here,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> says, pointing to his soiled, green cap. Indeed, there is a touch of organization amid the apparent chaos. `` See that'36 <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> asks, pointing to the moss-covered automobile partially imbedded in the ground outside the back of his shop. `` It's filled with table-model radios. That'35 Chevy over there? Filled with gaskets. Only gaskets.'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> bought most of the old cars and bicycles, although some were abandoned after being dropped off for repairs. `` I used to buy everything that came along,'' he says. All are for sale. `` I can make any one of'em run,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> insists. Entangled in vines and weeds, are probably 500 bicycles and cars, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> estimates, not including all the ones in hundreds of pieces. About 2 -LCB- tons of hubcaps are piled up, reaching the branches of the trees. `` I'd clean it all out, but even if I took 10 tons a day out it would still take seven or eight years to get rid of it all,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> says. Inside the weathered building is a cluttered maze of spare parts and cases of soda bottles stacked to the ceiling, dark and narrow aisles leading to several rooms. There's a grocery section and a shoe repair section, where <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> uses car tires to make rubber soles _ `` guaranteed not to wear out.'' `` This is where I do my painting,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> says, indicating a cramped area by a window. There are enamel paints on a cluttered, flat surface, but no room to sit down. It is here that <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> gets away from it all, painting wildlife scenes on aluminum printing plates. `` Ten dollars apiece. I sell lots of'em,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> says, pointing to the hundreds of finished products piled in his `` art department.'' His subjects come from postcards, photographs, other paintings or from memory. `` I start about 30 of'em at a time,'' he says proudly, displaying his favorite nature scenes. `` I started drawing on little scraps of paper when I was in the Air Force so I'd remember what everything looked like,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> says, taking out a pile of the aging pencil drawings on a shelf. An 11th-grade dropout, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> spent four years in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, from 1942 to'46, closing the shop while he was gone. When he returned, he married, and he and his wife, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>, have been running the store ever since, living in a rickety house next door. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s 94-year-old father, a former farmer, lives down the road. The Websters have three grown children, one of whom lives nearby and sometimes helps out at the store, and eight grandchildren. Asked if any of his children might take over the business after he retires, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> hesitates, as though it was the first time he's thought about it `` I do n't know,'' he says. `` But I'm not retiring any time soon.'' That's good news to his regulars. `` I've been a regular for five or six years,'' says customer <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Christner </PERSON>, who was here this time for a battery part. `` Whenever I get a flat tire, <PERSON> Cloyce </PERSON> always fixes them _ he fixes everything.'' And though some days are slower than others, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> insists he does a hearty business, especially considering he does n't own a telephone. `` If someone wants something, they'd better see me directly,'' he says. On Sundays, shaven and spruced up, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> closes shop and heads for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hesperia </ORGANIZATION>, where he sings in the choir. `` I think I'm pretty good,'' he says, smiling, exposing his two teeth _ both on the bottom.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ At age 81 and at work on his memoirs, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLennan </PERSON> keeps a surprisingly low profile for a man the Reader's Guide to the Canadian novel calls `` a writer of unique stature. He's written only seven novels and one book of essays in half a century, but five of those novels won the country's highest literary prize, the Governor General's Award, and he may have helped shape <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s political system.

 <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLennan </PERSON> secured a place in Canadian letters, and the nation's political lexicon, when he explored the cultural schism between French and <LOCATION> English </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in his evocative 1945 novel, `` Two Solitudes.'' The title became a code word for the linguistic divide, and <PERSON> MacLennan </PERSON> was credited with almost single-handedly creating `` Can Lit,'' a new wave of writing set in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> that also spelled success for <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>. In a conversation at his makeshift office in an old <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> building, <PERSON> MacLennan </PERSON>, 81, said `` Two Solitudes'' is `` a book a French-Canadian could n't have written. They could n't even do it now. They're too close to it.'' Questions draw a stream of observations from a man hooked on history and the classics and has <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> on his shelves and praises <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> as `` the American <PERSON> Byron </PERSON>.'' In quick succession, he says <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is a nation founded by losers but that's no bad thing; cites <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON>'s maxim that `` drama depends on the familiar''; theorizes that the fall of the Roman Empire was due to currency devaluation, and praises <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s fluency in Latin. Now collecting thoughts for a book of memoirs, <PERSON> MacLennan </PERSON> keeps a surprisingly low profile for a man the Reader's Guide to the Canadian Novel calls `` a writer of unique stature.'' The <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION> native lives with his invalid wife, <PERSON> Tota </PERSON>, in a redbrick apartment building just below <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> and takes a cab most afternoons to the small office <ORGANIZATION> Concordia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> puts at his disposal. In a voice retaining the Gaelic lilt of his native <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Breton </LOCATION>, as well as the rasp of a chain-smoker, <PERSON> MacLennan </PERSON> says he never made much money from `` Two Solitudes'' after sacrificing royalties to get it published. `` I only got 40 percent _ still do.'' Seldom interviewed or mentioned on radio and TV, <PERSON> MacLennan </PERSON> has published only seven novels and one book of essays in half a century. `` I endlessly rewrite,'' he explains. But five of those novels won the country's highest literary prize, the Governor General's Award, and `` Two Solitudes'' has been translated into at least eight languages. Critics reserve their highest praise for later books such as `` Each Man's Son'' and `` The Watch That Ends The Night,'' but it is `` Two Solitudes'' that struck the strongest chord in both English and French and was made into a movie. Built around French-Canadian aristocrat <PERSON> Athanase </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallard </PERSON> and his son, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, the novel describes the clash between <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, with its almost medieval Catholicism, and the mercantile English who once ran the province. `` I remember my publisher thought it would be too gloomy a title, but I said no, leave it,'' said <PERSON> MacLennan </PERSON>, who recently reread the book for the first time in years and concluded, `` It's better than I thought. The title came from a letter written by the German poet <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Rilke </PERSON> who said that even in love, there were two solitudes. <PERSON> MacLennan </PERSON> met an icy critical reception when he returned to the subject of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> in his prophetic 1967 novel `` Return of the Sphinx,'' which predicted separatist violence in the province with fathers and sons on opposite sides. Three years later, he was vindicated when revolutionary violence erupted, changing <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> politics forever. `` I feel sympathy for these people,'' he says, referring to the one-in-four Canadians who speak French at home. `` This continent is never going to start speaking French.'' He did n't anticipate the dramatic advances French-Canadians would make by the 1980s, taking political and economic control of their province, embracing the entrepreneurial spirit and breaking the shackles of the priests. `` It was like lightning. They started going to college and became more prosperous,'' says <PERSON> MacLennan </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> in 1935 to teach Latin and Greek at <ORGANIZATION> Lower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> boy's school and has never left He credits an old <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> friend, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>, with keeping the country together during <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s separatist explosion and having the vision to build a more tolerant, bilingual nation `` <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> was the only man who could have handled that situation when it came. He's absolutely without peer,'' he says, adding with a chuckle that <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> is also a mysterious fellow who in his youth liked to drive around <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> on a motorcycle wearing a German helmet. The son of a Presbyterian doctor, the young <PERSON> MacLennan </PERSON> knew more about <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> than he did his own country after going to <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> as a <LOCATION> Rhodes </LOCATION> scholar and using the opportunity to travel across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` It was the best education I could ever have. For about a year I thought I was a Communist but it did n't last long,'' he says, echoing a theme explored with great understanding in his 1958 novel, `` The Watch That Ends The Night.'' He recalls disillusionment on a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> visit in the 1930s when commissars tried to claim that since the revolution, cows could be milked four times a day. <PERSON> MacLennan </PERSON> met his American first wife, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, on the ship back from <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> and credits her with shaping his career. `` She really woke me up to the fact that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> was a different country than the States.'' Her slow death from heart disease is also the heroine's fate in `` The Watch That Ends The Night,'' which <PERSON> MacLennan </PERSON> completed as she was dying. After his first two novels were rejected by publishers _ `` They said he does n't write like an American, and he does n't write like an Englishman'' _ <PERSON> MacLennan </PERSON> found his voice in 1941 with a story set in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` Barometer Rising'' is a World War I saga based on a harrowing moment in <PERSON> MacLennan </PERSON>'s childhood, the <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION> explosion of 1917. He narrowly escaped death when a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> munitions ship filled with explosives collided with a freighter in the harbor. It was the largest non-nuclear explosion in history and killed more than 1,600 people. `` I was this far away from being beheaded,'' said the author, cupping his hands 2 feet apart. It's eight years since the book <PERSON> MacLennan </PERSON> swears will be his last novel, `` Voices in Time,'' which links <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, separatist <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> and the world after a cataclysmic future conflict dubbed `` the Destructions.'' `` I spent 12 years writing it. I was lost in it. I finally came to the conclusion that the most lethal people in the world are politicians.''

 Game show veteran <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Trebek </PERSON>, host of both `` Jeopardy'' and `` Concentration,'' sees a big difference in the two television contests. `` Jeopardy'' contestants have to be smarter and the producers are more fussy about who gets to play. `` ` Jeopardy' harks back to the quiz shows of the 1950s when you had to have intelligence and skill,'' <PERSON> Trebek </PERSON> says. `` You need brains, knowledge and quick reflexes. `` ` Concentration' is more of a traditional game show. The contestants match numbers and then get a chance to solve a puzzle. The important part is solving the puzzle, but getting a match lets you see more of the puzzle.'' `` Jeopardy'' is a quiz in which answers are provided in six categories and the contestants must come up with the questions. Each category has five answers, and the higher the prize money the tougher the question. Seen on 191 stations around the country, `` Jeopardy'' is the second-highest rated show in syndication, topped only by `` Wheel of Fortune.'' It's tough to get on `` Jeopardy.'' Game shows merely pick contestants from the audience. Would-be contestants for `` Jeopardy'' must pass a battery of tests. After a written test, contenders are matched against each other in a mock game to see how they react to pressure and competition. <PERSON> Trebek </PERSON>, relaxing in the living room of his hillside bachelor home, is wearing a pair of well-worn blue jeans and an old blue jacket he got for participating in the Bill Cosby celebrity tennis tournament in 1975. His house, overlooking the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, has a high-tech look of stark white walls and shiny metal surfaces. But his collection of Chinese paintings and statuettes, religious icons, carvings of African animals, other antiques and comfortable furniture make it homey. <PERSON> Trebek </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, where he got a degree in philosophy from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ottawa </ORGANIZATION> and worked 12 years for the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He had no desire to be a game show host, but when <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thicke </PERSON>, a transplanted Canadian, offered him a job in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as host of `` The Wizard of Odds'' he took it. That job lasted a year and he went on to `` High Rollers.'' He's also been the host of `` The $ 128,000 Question,'' `` Double Dare'' and `` Battlestars. He's been with `` Jeopardy'' for four years and `` Concentration'' for a year. `` My real ambition,'' he says, `` is to get into production. Producing ` Jeopardy' for the last three years has whetted my appetite. I think I can do it. It's just a question of finding the right projects. I'll produce whatever. Movies for TV, series, game shows. `` I've done a little acting, but you get typecast doing game shows. Besides, I have a very tight schedule.'' <PERSON> Trebek </PERSON> says he has learned that a contestant's education and other background is no indication of how he or she will do on `` Jeopardy.'' `` You get people from both sexes, from all kinds of backgrounds,'' he says. `` Generally speaking, people who are bright and about 30 years old will do best. Young people have quicker reflexes and that counts on the show. People slow down as they grow older. I know I have.'' <PERSON> Trebek </PERSON> says he created a seniors tournament for people over 50 so that older people can compete against their peers. It will be seen in May. Also a teen tournament is scheduled for February. Although many people play along at home, <PERSON> Trebek </PERSON> says the viewers do n't do as well as the contestants. `` It's the only show where the contestants are ahead of the viewers,'' he says. `` With most game shows the people at home are ahead. Still, it hooks people. They want to play the game. It's best if there are a number of people watching What good is it if you know all the answers and there's nobody there to see you triumph?''

 <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> took on a Broadway musical right after he went into a prime-time television series, with the understanding that it would be goodbye <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> if the TV show turned into a hit. Instead, `` <ORGANIZATION> Eisenhower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>'' was canceled by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and `` Romance Romance,'' a modest little musical that uses only four actors and minimal scenery, has blossomed on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. `` The timing was incredible,'' <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> said the other day, sitting in his dressing room at the <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> Theater. `` We wrapped the series in mid-February and started rehearsals for ` Romance Romance' in March. `` I came into it saying, ` I've got a TV series and may have to go back in mid-June,''' he recalls. `` And the producers said, ` OK.''' `` Romance Romance,'' two separate one-act musicals, looks at love in two very different places: turn-of-the-century <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and trendy, modern-day <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> plays a rakish man about town in the first act and an anguished yuppie contemplating an affair with a friend's wife in the second. The show and <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> were nominated for 1988 Tony awards. Neither won, but the musical received national exposure on the Tony telecast and has found a growing audience. A recording by <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> Classics is scheduled for release in late summer. For <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON>, the recognition secured a stage reputation that sprouted before he first went off to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to do television. The 33-year-old <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> is one of those actors who looks at ease in both mediums, although he says he is more comfortable on stage than on television. `` I find the camera to be confining, but I've gotten over that,'' he says. `` I tend to like to be physical on stage _ to move and to do things.'' Television requires a certain precision, he says _ hitting your mark and then being still. `` How can you act?'' <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> asks. `` But that's the trick of it when you're coming from the theater. Now I'm used to it.'' <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON>, who hails from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, found performing a part of his life while growing up. `` I always sang and that led to doing theater,'' he says. He went to the Univerity of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> to study business but later switched to theater. `` I left school and came here to work in 1976, not study theater,'' <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> recalls. `` But I ended up studying my head off all over town for years.'' Still, <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> had a job in show business the third day he was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, although he had to leave town again to get it. The work was in a dinner theater in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> which was doing `` Shenandoah,'' a musical that supported him a lot during his first years in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Whenever times got lean, it seemed like a company of <ORGANIZATION> ` </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shenandoah </ORGANIZATION>' would come up,'' he says. The actor finally made it to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> in 1983, seven years after arriving in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He survived `` Marilyn: an American Fable,'' a short-lived and much-maligned musical based on the life of <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>. In it, he played <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> legend <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> DiMaggio </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>'s husbands. The troubled show, which had 13 producers listed above the title, went through weeks of previews after the first director, choreographer and leading lady were replaced. `` It was very frustrating,'' <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> says now, `` but it was my first Broadway show, so it also was very exciting.'' The experience led <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> almost immediately into a much happier effort, `` 3 Guys Naked from the Waist Down.'' The off-Broadway musical, written by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Colker </PERSON>, was a hip, offbeat look at the world of stand-up comedians, one job in show business <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> had never tried. `` Now I know why people are stand-up comics,'' he says. `` When you are really cooking, you feel like you can stay out there for two hours, and they'll laugh at anything you say. It's a real heady kind of feeling to be totally in control of an audience.'' <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> went west to appear in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> production of the off-Broadway musical `` <ORGANIZATION> Nite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confidential </ORGANIZATION>.'' He moved into television with an occasional role on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Designing Women'' as <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Potts </PERSON>' ex-husband and a major part in <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Gung Ho,'' which died quickly in a brutal time slot where it faced both `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and `` Miami Vice.'' <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> was cast as the fly-by-night lawyer in `` <ORGANIZATION> Eisenhower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>'' in July 1987 but the first episode was n't filmed until October. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> did n't require a pilot because of the sterling reputation of the show's producers, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION>. The 13 episodes that eventually were made did n't set the Nielsens afire, though the ratings had started to improve when the show was canceled. `` I ca n't really explain what <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> did to the show,'' he says. `` We did everything they asked of us. We even got the 18 - to 40-year-old audience that sponsors love `` The network only has six half-hour shows on the schedule for the fall,'' he adds. `` There were not that many slots to fill.'' Fortunately, while in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to publicize `` <ORGANIZATION> Eisenhower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> did an informal audition for <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harman </PERSON>, the composer and director-lyricist of `` Romance Romance.'' `` I had n't sung in a while and my voice was out of shape,'' he says. But he got the job. `` It's kind of like a storybook ending,'' <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> says `` We survived opening night, which is a rarity these days, and then got all those <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> nominations. And business has been getting better. I'm not going anywhere else for a while.''

 Forty years after its creation and 35 years after a devastating war, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is trying to end decades of authoritarian rule and build a stable democracy to match its colossal economic achievements. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, founded on Aug. 15, 1948, has become one of the most modern and rapidly expanding economic powers in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, but its politics have not changed as quickly. Despite liberal reforms in the last year, a powerful elite of government bureaucrats, military commanders and business leaders still dominates the nation, as it has for most of South Korean history. Political leaders, analysts, intellectuals and others agree the nation must build an enduring democratic system and stabilize its turbulent politics if it is to find domestic peace and continue to modernize and grow. The question is how. This nation of 41 million people also faces the challenge of more fairly sharing the benefits of economic expansion. The industrial workers who helped build and fuel the economy are clamoring for change. The 1988 Olympic Games being held here in September will be dramatic proof of how far <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has come since the Korean War ended in an armistice in 1953. The war, which began with an invasion by communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, left more than 1 million killed and injured. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> still has not given up its hopes of reuniting <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, divided by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops at the end of World War II. The two governments are locked in a bitter struggle for supremacy on the peninsula, and both sides claim to be the sole legitimate Korean government. Hundreds of thousands of troops face each other in constant tension along a 150-mile demilitarized zone, including 40,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops supporting the south. But signs of progress on the domestic political front and tentative moves to reduce tension with the north have stirred hope that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> can overcome its challenges. After decades of authoritarian rule by military and civilian strongmen a desire for change sent hundreds of thousands of people into the streets in the summer of 1987. The demonstrators ranged from students to middle-class businessmen and forced President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, who seized power in a 1980 military coup, to agree to elections and reforms. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, an ally of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> who had backed the call for reforms, won the presidential elections with a slender victory over a divided opposition. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general like <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, took office Feb. 25 in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s first peaceful transfer of power. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a mix of pragmatist and populist, promised to end decades of authoritarian rule and usher in full democracy. `` Now nobody will be able to reverse the current of democracy,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> declared. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has seen rapid liberal reforms during the past year. Political, intellectual and artistic freedom has flowered with the government no longer trying to regulate almost every aspect of life. Restrictions and controls on opposition groups, labor unions, dissidents, the press and other groups have been lifted or reduced. Most opposition groups operate freely after years of repression. Peaceful protests, strikes and political rallies have become commonplace in a nation where a year ago riot police suppressed almost all independent political activity. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, who cultivates a `` common man'' image, has gained growing support for his programs. A recent poll said 53 percent of Koreans approve of the president, but just 21 percent support his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> because of past abuses. Despite the recent changes, some observers fear the divisions and antagonisms that have plagued <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> politics for years have not been resolved and the nation could again face chaos. Opposition groups are determined to end the governing elite's power and insist they alone can build full democracy Hardline opposition, dissident and labor groups claim <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is a front for military rule and say they wo n't end their struggle to oust the administration. Radical students, a small but powerful minority on campuses, continue to stage violent protests. Factionalism continues to dominate Korean politics with cliques under autocratic leaders constantly struggling for power. Factions are seen as a barrier to democracy because they do not tolerate differing views and reject compromise as weakness. Some political leaders fear the political calm could end after the Olympics. The opposition intends to keep <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to his promise of letting voters evaluate his performance after the Games. Opposition leaders want a referendum and say <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> must step down if he loses. Government leaders say there can be no question of the president surrendering power. Some officials say government hardliners have tolerated moderate policies because they do n't want to offend international opinion when the Olympics focus world attention on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. But the hardliners may try to crack down on the opposition later, they say. While <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> seeks political stability, it faces a related challenge from workers, the poor and others for a much larger share in the rewards of the economic success they helped create. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> grew from being one of the poorest <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nations with a gross national product of $ 1.8 billion in 1955 to a GNP of $ 119 billion last year. Once almost dependent on foreign aid, <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> now has a $ 10 billion trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its exports flood markets around the world. Industrial workers who produce the cars, electronic goods and other items that have fueled the export boom want dramatic improvements after decades of poor pay, Spartan lifestyles and long work hours. The government, which in the past backed business and suppressed labor groups, agrees there must be major changes. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has encouraged business to work with workers and unions. `` High economic growth has been a national driving force, but now attention must also be given to greater distribution of wealth to help the needy,'' government <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Giel-joong </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Some labor leaders contend the concessions are token and many workers lead poor and bleak lives. They complain of cramped, squalid housing, poor food and long, exhausting work hours in dangerous and oppressive working conditions. The government rejects opposition claims that 25 percent of the populations of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities live in poverty. Officials say about 6 percent of city dwellers are below the official poverty line of about $ 300 a month. `` The government underestimates the number of the poor to give themselves legitimacy and to project <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as a prosperous nation,'' said Rev. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwang-soo </PERSON>, a dissident who helps the poor. Young Soo-gil, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said managers and workers must find a new relationship to increase living standards without hurting productivity and exports by driving up costs too much. `` It will take some doing,'' he said.

 `` Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' the <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> @ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> homage to the Saturday matinee serial, spawned a host of films in the same genre, ranging from the good -LRB- `` Romancing the Stone'' -RRB- to the poor -LRB- `` The Golden Child'' -RRB-. Now comes `` Vibes,'' which lands somewhere in between. The new <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> release most resembles `` Romancing the Stone'' in that an antagonistic couple are thrown into a fortune quest in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wilderness, falling in love along the way. `` Vibes'' has some other attributes as well, including stunning Ecuadorian scenery and the movie debut of rock superstar <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauper </PERSON>. The story begins promisingly in a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> psychic lab operated by <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sands </PERSON> -LRB- `` Room with a View'' -RRB-. Among his subjects is <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldblum </PERSON>, a museum worker who can reveal people's secrets by touching their personal possessions, and Miss <PERSON> Lauper </PERSON>, a blond bimbo who can foretell the future with the help of a spirit companion named <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON>. The pair take an instant dislike for each other, and their feelings intensify when they arrive in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. What are they doing in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>? Well, it seems that a shady character resembling the TV detective <PERSON> Columbo </PERSON> has enlisted them to help find his lost son. Why they would trust such a person is one of the many mysteries contained in the script. Expectably, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>'s ruse is exposed. What he is really after is Incan treasure hidden for centuries in the Andes. The search has already claimed two lives, but the lure of fortune has still attracted thugs and adventurers who will use any means to snatch it first. Such goings-on provide a reasonable basis for a high-tech, action-adventure. So what goes wrong? For one thing, the leading characters sound like vintage <PERSON> Damon </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON>, and the script writers, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Babaloo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandel </PERSON>, have supplied one-liners that only now and then zing. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwapis </PERSON> directed with a good eye for action, but his actors seldom shine. <PERSON> Goldblum </PERSON>, who has created a number of memorable characters, is strangely restrained. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> veers from the amusing to the annoying. That brings us to the celebrated Miss <PERSON> Lauper </PERSON>. She is typecast as the wise-cracking babe in search of a man, and her role seems to duplicate <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> in `` Born Yesterday.'' Yet there are no false notes in the singer's portrayal, and at times she can be quite touching. A film career could be assured if _ a big if _ she can slip into roles that depart from her music videos. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Blum </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganz </PERSON> produced `` Vibes,'' which is rated PG for language and excitement. Running time: 99 minutes.

 `` Walker'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> Home Video; VHS @ Beta, $ 79.95; Rated R -RRB- `` <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>,'' based on a true story about an early American incursion into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, is one of those movies that flopped at the box-office but sounds as if it might be an unappreciated gem just waiting to be rediscovered on ideo. Unfortunately, even on the home screen, `` Walker'' is still a flop _ though with its timely subject it can hardly fail to generate some interest. The film, directed by <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, retells the story of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a soldier of fortune who led a bloody invasion of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in the 1850s. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, as portrayed by <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, is a ruthless idealist, who as he orders mass slaughters of civilians, mouths platitudes about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s duty to `` protect our neighbors from oppression'' _ and apparently believes what he's saying. According to the filmmakers, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> sets out on his expedition at the urging of <ORGANIZATION> Cornelius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION>, played here by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> as a flatulent, foul-mouthed old tyrant who wants to protect his railroad line running through <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> from rival nationalist groups. The climax of the film is an impassioned speech <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> gives _ shortly before his one-man rule is toppled and he is executed _ in which he tells the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> people that `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will never leave you alone.'' Chilling words, but <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> runs the contemporary angle into the ground by littering the movie with deliberate anachronisms like helicopters, cigarette machines and personal computers. Much of the dialogue and direction seems sloppy and confused, and there has n't been so much blood spilled on screen since `` The Wild Bunch.'' Oscar-winner <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON> has about five good minutes early on as <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s deaf girlfriend. But once she dies of cholera, both he and the movie go downhill fast. _ By <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` The Lost Weekend,'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>; VHS @ Beta, $ 59.95; Not rated -RRB- It is fascinating and frightening to watch <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Milland </PERSON> as the literate, desperate alcoholic <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Birnam </PERSON> in `` The Lost Weekend.'' His performance earned him an Academy Award in <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s 1945 movie, which also was named best picture. <PERSON> Milland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> are the film's stars, but alcohol is the main character. Taken from the <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> novel of the same name, `` The Lost Weekend'' shows three days in <LOCATION> Birnam </LOCATION>'s life _ horrible drunken days when <PERSON> Birnam </PERSON> sinks to the depths of his soul, tormented by his failure as a writer. He rummages madly through his brother's apartment in search of a bottle of whiskey he himself hid but lost, trudges relentlessly through <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> in search of an open shop to pawn his typewriter. In one of the film's saddest moments, he chooses a sip from his tumbler of liquor over the kiss of <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> -RRB-, who loves him. Still, <PERSON> Birnam </PERSON>, who talks of writing a novel called `` The Bottle,'' is witty and eloquent. Drink, he tells a bartender, may shrink his liver and pickle his kidney. `` But what does it do to my mind? It tosses the sandbags overboard so the balloon can soar.'' It makes no difference that the movie is 43 years old, or that it's in black and white _ even today there could be no more persuasive advertisement against alcohol abuse. _ By <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> MacVean </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<HEAD>Helmets Urged To Protect Children In Bicycle-Mounted Child Seats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 Children who ride along in bicycle-mounted seats should wear approved, crash-tested safety helmets, experts say as a growing number of children are being seriously injured in cycling accidnts. In a study of injuries to bicycle passengers, Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON>, a pediatrician at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, found that 65 percent of the injuries to children in bicycle-mounted child seats are to the head and face. `` The reason for that preponderance of head injuries, we believe, is that these seats put children high off the ground, and that when the bicycle falls over, the child's head is the highest part of the whole bicycle. `` You combine that with the fact that toddlers do n't have much head control. Their heads are heavy in relation to their bodies, and they do n't have the muscle development an older child has,'' <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol records of bicycle-related injuries and deaths to children under age 6, from 1977 to 1986, showed that the number of injuries to cyclists remained relatively constant. But injuries to passengers jumped from 17 percent of the total in 1977 to 28 percent in 1986. `` This is a real problem, one whose magnitude has been insufficiently appreciated, and a pr0-71; Young toms 22-24 lb 71, 24-26 lb 66-68, 26-28 lb 68-70, 28-30 lb 70-73 cents.

 An optical telescope destined to float next year from a space shuttle orbiting beyond the haze of atmosphere will let scientists peer into the depths of the universe and 14 billion years intothe past. In orbit, the <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubble </PERSON> <PERSON> Space </PERSON> <PERSON> Telescope </PERSON> should see seven times as far as the 2 billion light years of the most powerful earth-bound telescopes. First scheduled for an August 1986 launch, it so far has n't looked at anything It sits in a windowless room, wrapped in silvery thermal blankets, running up bills. After the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger accident halted the shuttle program, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> official told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the telescope would be expensive to `` baby-sit.'' `` Baby-sit makes it sound like the telescope's sitting there, all ready to go,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulkin </PERSON>, director of scientific space programs here at <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missiles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` You put it in the cocoon, and just before flight take it out of the cocoon and fly it Well, that's not the case.'' Beyond $ 1.5 billion to build the telescope, the cost of continuing work during the first 30 months of delay will reach $ 400 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> project manager <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojtalik </PERSON>. Faulty devices installed originally have led to dozens of alerts and driven up costs by as much as $ 10 million a year. That's for a project approved in 1977 at $ 572 million. The telescope was built to work in the vacuum of space and must be protected from even minute amounts of dust, moisture and noise. Its 94.5-inch primary mirror has been kept virtually free of contamination. In the `` clean room,'' giant fans cleanse the air through filters that can screen particles 200 times thinner than a hair. The 350 scientists, engineers, computer experts and others attending the craft must wear uncomfortable white `` bunny suits,'' masks and rubber gloves; anyone entering must be covered completely and pass through an air shower. The 42-foot-tall, 25,000-pound, aluminum-framed spacecraft has been taken apart and almost put back together in preparation for shipping in November to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> via the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. The scientific instruments, designed to be serviced every three to five years in space, have been pulled out more than a dozen times for inspections, repairs and improvements. The Hubble got a clean bill of health two years ago after what <PERSON> Bulkin </PERSON> calls `` 57 nightmarish days'' of around-the-clock testing using extreme cold and heat to simulate space. The longer it sat on the ground, though, the more problems it developed. `` We had alerts coming out of the bazoo,'' <PERSON> Bulkin </PERSON> said. When a part fails, an alert is signaled and contractors of other devices using that part are notified. Reams of computer printouts have to be analyzed. `` If it's a problem like the thermostats, where six out of about 150 of them were bad, and you're sitting on the launch pad, you replace the bad ones and go,'' he said. `` If you have time, like we've had for the last two years, then you pull the boxes and fix them all.'' Defective thermostats and resistors were replaced and more efficient solar cells and batteries added. For its 17-day trip to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the telescope will be placed in a 27-by-19-by-60-foot, hermetically sealed, steel container, moved by barge to the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminal </ORGANIZATION> across <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> and be loaded on a ship. `` There is a lot of anxiety about the move. The canal is not the safest area,'' said <PERSON> Bulkin </PERSON>. `` Every time you lift it up, you're sitting there and your heart goes ` Boom Boom! Boom!' I'm not going to be happy until it's in orbit from the time it leaves here.'' In the future, such telescopes will be moved by a specially modified Army transport plane, but the plane wo n't be ready in time. Meanwhile, budget-minded officials are n't the only ones concerned about the delay. So are astronomers and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which paid 15 percent of the building costs and provided the sophisticated faint object camera. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> decided five years ago to hold its 1988 meeting in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, near the Goddard Space Flight Center in <LOCATION> Greenbelt </LOCATION>, which is managing the Hubble instruments, mission operations and data. `` It was to be the centerpiece of the meeting. They expected to have their first views ready by now,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which was host for the assembly last week. `` We're all frustrated by having to wait so long, but it's going to be fantastic fun when it's in orbit,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Westphal </PERSON>, professor of planetary science at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and a principal investigator on the telescope. `` I suspect we're going to find many amazing things that will thrill the public, not once a year but maybe once a week.'' The Hubble is named after an American astronomer who used the 100-inch Hooker Telescope in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> to examine stars in the Andromeda Galaxy, the first conclusive proof of galaxies other than our Milky Way. The space telescope is smaller than many land-based observatories, but should transmit much sharper images because it will be stationed more than 350 miles above the distorting effects of the atmosphere. It also will be able to make images in the ultraviolet or black spectra that ca n't be made on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Telescopes that follow the Hubble into orbit will study X-rays, gamma rays and infrared radiation. The new view of the universe scientists for, <PERSON> Westphal </PERSON> said, is similar in impact to the vision a very nearsighted person would get by putting on glasses for the first time. `` I'm prejudiced, but I think it is well worth the money because it will help solve some of the puzzles man has wondered about for thousands of years,'' he said. `` I'll let you know after it sends back some pictures,'' <PERSON> Bulkin </PERSON> said. Astronomers plan to look for evidence of planets in other solar systems, study planets in our solar system in greater detail, search for `` black holes'' in galaxies and measure the distance between stars more accurately. They will try, too, for a better understanding of the origins and possible fate of the universe as they gaze at light that took 14 billion years to get here _ close to the beginning of time in the universe. Scientists will be able to explore a region 350 times larger than they can, said Italian astrophysicist <PERSON> Duccio </PERSON> <PERSON> Macchetto </PERSON>. `` Looking far away means going back in time,'' <PERSON> Macchetto </PERSON> said. `` We hope to go back to those periods in which galaxies and quasars were formed.''

<HEAD>Ultrasound Can Serve As Baby's First Checkup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>

 Baby should have his first checkup, some experts believe, about five months before birth. `` All women should have careful ultrasound in the fourth month of pregnancy as though it is the baby's first physical exam,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most people think about prenatal diagnosis as preparatory to early termination'' of the pregnancy, said Hall. `` But really it's not It allows us to begin early treatment.'' Doctors may recommend abortion if ultrasound finds a severe defect, but this is n't always the case. Ultrasound, in which the echoes of sound waves make pictures of the fetus inside the womb, often is a routine part of prenatal care, but <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> believes it can be employed much more effectively to thoroughly examine a growing fetus. `` Some of us in the business of doing high-risk obstetrical ultrasound can probably pick up most of the major congenital abnormalities,'' agreed Dr. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benacerraf </PERSON>, a radiologist at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. About 5 percent of babies have significant congenital malformations, physical defects present at birth that require extensive treatment or change a child's life. While the newborn death rate has fallen dramatically over the years, the liklihood of serious birth defects has not changed. At a recent genetics conference at the Jackson Laboratory here, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> contended that at least half of all these birth defects could be spotted before birth through ultrasound exams. <PERSON> Benacerraf </PERSON> has shown that doctors can accurately identify fetuses with Down's syndrome by looking for thighbones that are slightly shorter than usual and an extra roll of skin on the back of the neck. Even though many women already have ultrasound during pregnancy, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said it is not ordinarily used to take a careful look at the unborn child's health. Instead, it is primarly intended to measure the size of the baby's head and the length of his arms so physicians can determine how old the fetus is. Among other things, she said, ultrasound can be used to check the severity of osteogenesis imperfecta, a birth defect in which the child suffers broken bones. The scan can help determine whether the child would benefit from Caesarean section to avoid fractures during birth. Ultrasound can also help spot fetal heart block, a condition in which the fetus's heart fails to beat strongly enough. This condition can be treated before birth by giving the mother digitalis. <PERSON> Benacerraf </PERSON> said she believes all pregnant women should have ultrasound, but she cautioned that many doctors are not trained to spot birth defects. Physicians who have so-called level one training, she said, `` are just getting a couple of measurements and counting heads,'' while those with more sophisticated skills look for the often subtle signs of abnormalities. <PERSON> Benacerraf </PERSON> said a major study, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, is trying to determine whether routinely doing the more sophisticated ultrasound is worth the expense, which is between $ 150 and $ 300. But even if it turns out to make economic and medical sense on a large scale, it will not immediately be available everywhere. `` There are not that many people trained in this field,'' she said. `` If, all of a sudden, we decided to scan everybody who's pregnant, we could n't possibly handle the volume.

 A mama bear is a crowd-pleaser, especially with a roly-poly cub romping at her side. But what's a zoo to do when baby grows up? Too often, surplus pen-reared black bears are sold, traded to dubious buyers or killed, and the mother bred again so zoo visitors wo n't be robbed of the baby bear experience, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelton </PERSON>, a wildlife science professor. <PERSON> Pelton </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> are tracking radio-collared bears released from zoo areas into the <ORGANIZATION> Cherokee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Pen-raised black bears have been used in research in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, but `` this is the first time we've made a concerted effort to keep track of them,'' <PERSON> Pelton </PERSON> said. `` We want to learn more about how they react to a new environment after having been born in captivity ...'' `` The main thrust of the study is to determine simply if these animals will make it in the wild and if they're suitable for release,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. `` That's the big question. Should we even take these bears off the hands of zoos, or should we just allow them to be bought and sold?'' Six bears, wearing radio collars, have been released, three each from the Ober <LOCATION> Gatlinburg </LOCATION> and Grandfather Mountain resort zoos. One bear grew dependent on area residents for ice cream and other food handouts. When the zoo that had housed it declined to take it back, the bear had to be killed. The resort later relented and took back another bear after similar problems arose, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. A third bear was found dead in the forest. Foul play is suspected and an autopsy is pending. Radio contact has been lost with a fourth bear. Despite the problems, neither <PERSON> Pelton </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> is ready to give up. About 20 pen-raised black bears have been released into the wild in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> over the last 10 to 15 years, but without radio collars there's no way of knowing their whereabouts, <PERSON> Pelton </PERSON> said. In the past, tattoos and ear tags were used on pen-raised bears. At least three have turned up dead as the result of legal hunts, which tells researchers they managed to adapt, at least to nature. The handling of bears in captivity has a lot to do with their odds of making it in the wild, <PERSON> Pelton </PERSON> said. Often, they're fed dried dog food rather than berries and acorns, and are given treats by zoo visitors. Neither practice boosts their chances of adapting. In addition, their cages are sometimes bereft of places to climb and hide, a more natural environment, and they're allowed too much contact with humans. Several years ago, the state prohibited the caging of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> black bears in areas other than bona fide zoos or zoological parks. The law does n't require special diets or cages to help the bears survive in the wild if the need arose. `` My hope is that the state game people say to the people who generate these animals, ` We need to do a, b, c and d. Otherwise, we ca n't work with you,''' <PERSON> Pelton </PERSON> said.

 Algae growing in ponds in the Israeli desert could lead to new products to bring agriculture to arid regions. `` We are seeding plants that would never grow in the desert,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> botanist <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramus </PERSON>. `` This project is in its infancy. What we are developing now will come to fruition in the year 2000 and later.'' <PERSON> Ramus </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gurion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researchers are growing algae in labs and transferring them to ponds in the Valley of Arava in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION>. The ponds, fed by fossil water from 3,000-foot wells, each hold a different type of algae. They also are growing Saint <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> fish in the ponds. The fish produce nitrogen to help the algae grow and bring a good price at market. `` Aquaculture of Saint <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> fish is becoming a big industry there. It's a real delicacy for them,'' <PERSON> Ramus </PERSON> said. `` One fish is enough for a meal. It's like the catfish or crawfish industry in the Southeast.'' The algae can be used to produce beta carotene, a source of Vitamin A; phycolloids, which are food thickeners; and biliproteins, which can be used in food colorings, he said.

<HEAD>Heating Young Chickens Can Make Them Heat-Resistant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chickens die during heat waves because they ca n't sweat, but heating chicks seems to make them more resistant as adults, says a researcher who does n't have `` the foggiest idea'' why. Chickens exposed to 95 to 100 degree temperatures when they are 5 days old, and again when they are 6 weeks old, seem to have a survival rate 70 percent to 95 percent better than unheated chickens, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Denbow </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> associate professor of poultry science. `` It's kind of neat.'' Asked how it works, he said, `` We do n't have the foggiest idea.'' Chickens cool off by panting, which evaporates water through their respiratory systems, said <PERSON> Denbow </PERSON>, who has spent three years testing the birds. Broilers are usually ready for market at about six to seven weeks.

 After last year's record growth, furniture industry analysts projected business would flatten out in 1988. So far, their projections are on the mark. But that does n't mean the furniture manufacturers, many of them in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, are sitting on their hands. Faced with the industry's first prolonged no-growth period since 1982, the manufacturers are developing innovative ways to attract retailers and consumers. Some are pushing new furniture lines to catch the eyes of potential customers. Others are working to improve services. Prices have been sharpened and new marketing strategies devised. `` The people who will be successful will do their homework, come out with some new lines and sharpen their pricing,'' said High Point designer <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Culler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Culler </PERSON>, who designs furniture for 10 different companies, feels it will take good business acumen rather than exotic designs if manufacturers are to entice consumers to buy as they did in 1987. `` I've always said 80 percent of what we do is merchandising and 20 percent -LRB- is -RRB- design,'' he said in an interview. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPaolo </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in High Point, said the business slowdown during the first few months of this year caused some difficulties for some factories. `` Their cash flow has become squeezed,'' he said in an interview. `` We might start seeing some shorter work weeks.'' <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddan </PERSON>, an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said shipments and orders from factories to retailers have been flat this year, when compared with the record levels of a year ago. First quarter shipments, measured by units, were up less than 1 percent over the same period in 1987, he said. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Epperson </PERSON>, a furniture industry analyst with Wheat, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, brokerage house, said the reductions could lead to shorter work weeks and smaller backlogs in orders. `` It's not that business is not clipping along at a good rate,'' he said. `` Retailers are not ordering as far in advance because the backlogs are n't as large. Business in the popular price points has been tough most of the year. But it's more complicated than to just say consumers are n't buying furniture.'' <PERSON> Epperson </PERSON> said many furniture retailers have been struggling to comply with the federal tax reforms of 1986. No longer can they pay their taxes on an installment basis and defer some payments, he said. `` Now they have to pre-pay the government before taking out of their inventories,'' he said. `` They are less generous in credit terms and stricter in inventories. `` We've seen a year of significant inventory liquidation,'' <PERSON> Epperson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reddan </PERSON> stressed that 1987 was a record year for shipments and orders. `` You must remember that employment is at an all-time high in the furniture industry,'' he said. `` Flat is very good _ a lot better than some people had feared.'' Until last October's stock market crash, optimism was strong in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the nation's leading producer of household goods. In 1987, manufacturers shipped nearly $ 15.8 billion worth of furniture, a 10 percent increase over 1986. Retail sales last year advanced 5 percent to $ 27.2 billion. Topping those figures is difficult when the growth in the national economy has slowed, especially when new home starts, housing resales and interest rates also reflect a slowdown over 1987. `` It will be a flat year at retail, down between 3 to 5 percent below last year in unit terms,'' <PERSON> Epperson </PERSON> said. Prior to last April's <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> in High Point, some analysts were predicting that manufacturers would bring out many new product lines to generate business. <PERSON> Epperson </PERSON> said that did n't turn out to be the case. `` If anything, many factories are cutting back on the number of items they offer,'' he said. `` When you produce 600 sofas at one time, the cost is less.'' Many manufacturers are working to strengthen their relationship with a smaller number of retailers by providing better services _ such as accelerated delivery, guaranteed delivery or better credit terms, <PERSON> Epperson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barentine </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Factories </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION>, said prospects are picking up for the fall furniture market. `` If interest rates remain stable as well as housing starts, and consumer demand is strong, we'll be OK,'' he said. <PERSON> Barentine </PERSON> said many manufacturers have decided to stay with successful lines rather than try to push new ones. They also follow consumer preference _ for example, in case goods. `` They're willing to pay and in return they demand high quality,'' Barentine said. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Cushman </PERSON>, of Furniture Today, a trade publication based in High Point, said she does n't anticipate that manufacturers will respond to sluggish sales by introducing more new lines of furniture than they usually do at the twice-yearly markets in High Point. `` I do n't think we can say across the board there will be a lot of innovation in order to boost sales,'' she said.

 One controversial furniture industry marketing tool has become the focus of a lawsuit filed by 13 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> retailers against <ORGANIZATION> Thomasville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, which implemented a policy in April restricting catalog and telephone sales. To continue as dealers of <LOCATION> Thomasville </LOCATION>'s high-end products, <LOCATION> Thomasville </LOCATION> said, its 51 retailers in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> must install a gallery. Like other manufacturers, <LOCATION> Thomasville </LOCATION> started a gallery program in 1982 in which its furniture is displayed in a room-like setting. `` It's a period of adjustment,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Cushman </PERSON>, of Furniture Today, a trade publication. `` The gallery alignment is a challenge facing the industry. It creates a strong relationship between the manufacturer and the retailer.'' Ms. <PERSON> Cushman </PERSON> said many smaller stores are reluctant to devote valuable floor space to one manufacture's furniture. The result is fewer dealers selling the products, she said. In <LOCATION> Thomasville </LOCATION>'s case, it was a profitable move. In 1982, <LOCATION> Thomasville </LOCATION> reported sales of $ 130 million through 4,000 retailers. Last year, the number of dealers stood at 555 _ with sales at $ 260 million. However, the 13 plaintiffs allege that restrictions on telephone and catalog sales violate antitrust laws. The 13 are among 40 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> retailers that have signed up for the program.

 Does it require a really experienced decorator to get the maximum decorating mileage out of a dollar? Not at all, say designers <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON>, who have come up with a few top-drawer ideas that would n't cost all that much. Although both ignored budgetary constraints this spring in rooms they decorated at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kips </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Showhouse </LOCATION>, they were able to suggest some low-cost, quick-fix ideas for imparting special style to your home. `` Cost is irrelevant,'' says <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> designer whose clients usually can afford not to pay much attention to the expense. It is the unexpected that makes for interest, not the dollars, she says. `` In my house in <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> -RRB-, I have a lot of junk furniture from second-hand stores that I've painted,'' she says. `` Put that junk in a room with one thing that's really good _ a rug, painting, chair, armoire, for example _ and it will still look terrific.'' She says you can find the money for the splurge item by saving in other places. `` I prefer to buy an old sofa and put a slipcover on it and then spend the difference on something with value and impact,'' she says. Another factor that distinguishes rooms created by good designers, she says, is attention to detail. `` Details make the difference between a room that look well-planned and one that does n't. People notice, but they do n't know that they do.'' An example is to upgrade the lampshades. `` You can turn ordinary lampshades into custom wonders with store-bought dye and commercial trims applied with glue,'' she says. For about $ 35, she created a shade by dyeing a plain white lampshade a very pale pink and then applying a fringe trim in pink and green at the base and a thinner braid trim with the same colors at the top. It took only a few minutes and less than a yard of trim, she says, to create something that would cost about $ 200 if custom-made. `` Many people are afraid to do things that are not formula,'' says <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>. `` That is what decorators do. Until they actually see it in place, they do n't know for sure if their choices will work together. I do n't care how good you are. The very best decorators try some things that wo n't work and they take them out.'' Designer <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON> advises dealing with bad walls by slipcovering them in inexpensive fabric. He seams fabric top and bottom and then installs it in ready-made hardware that fastens to the ceiling or wall. Or he uses Velcro fasteners on the wall and fabric, or simply staples the fabric to the wall. <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON> says that sheeting and remnants you can buy for 99 cents a yard work as well as more costly fabrics and the effect can completely change the room. If cost is a factor, he says, disguise the bad condition of wood and concrete floors with paint. When carpeting a stairway, paint stripes to the left and right of the carpeted tread to create the illusion of a costly border treatment. To create height and emphasize a mood of grandeur at windows, he suggests hanging curtains right at the ceiling line. If the preferred treatment is a shade, it, too, can be hung above the actual window. If you need substantially more storage room, do n't overlook the possibility of converting the unused space under a staircase, <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON> says. Remove the sheetrock surround and install shelves. Then cover the space with a hinged door and different sheetrock or pull-up panels. He suggests painting or wallpapering it to match the rest of the room.

 Nature provides the outdoor beauty of a landscape, but only you can improve your indoor view with an eye-catching wallscape or tablescape. Surround that single photo on the wall or the single vase on the table with complementary objects such as candles, flowers and souvenirs, suggests <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, home fashions director for <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION>, catalog marketer and merchandiser. `` The most important thing to remember when designing a ` scape' is to include the things you love,'' she says For a wallscape, she says, try to gather wall pieces of different sizes and shapes, such as paintings in round, square and rectangular frames. Keep the larger and heavier items at the bottom of the wallscape _ and visualize the result by arranging them on the floor before hanging them on the wall. When creating a tablescape, says <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, gather items such as small photographs, lace, candlesticks, dried flowers and silver trinkets and arrange them in alternating shapes and sizes. Drape lace over the table to soften the look. Tablescapes, she says, can change as often as a mood _ and the objects do n't have to be nailed down. Wallscapes and tablescapes can be complementary, if they are near each other, <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> says. `` If you coordinate the colors, you're halfway there. For a more complete picture, try repeating an object in a painting on the table. If there's a candle in the painting, put a candle on the table. `` Make sure objects on the wall do n't overwhelm objects on the table. All of the items should be in proportion to one another.''

 One picture may be worth a thousand words, but in today's decorating climate, the frame may be more valuable than the picture <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reports an increase of interest in elaborate frames as well as a trend toward framing everything from needlepoint and family heirlooms to mementoes and memorabilia. The <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> department store in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, recently opened a frame shop next to its stationery department to handle the increased interest in framed photographs as a decorative accessory. A new book, `` Displaying Pictures and Photographs,'' offers guidance on aesthetic and practical issues in framing, arranging and lighting art works. <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifton-Mogg </PERSON>, co-author of the book, with Piers Feethman, says selecting the right frame is not a simple matter; each instance is unique. Frames can not only show off the art work to best advantage, but can add luster to insignificant works. Until recently, it was considered most appropriate to hang pictures against a white wall. Now, pictures may hang against patterned wallpaper or a decorated and colored wall surface. Busy backgrounds, however, need strong pictures and frames. Choose pictures that complement the decorative period of the room, or introduce a color of the wallpaper in the mat or frame surrounding the artwork. For the best arrangement for framed artwork, says Miss Clifton-Mogg, consider the style and mood of the room or area in which the work will hang, as well as the relationship of the mat and frame to the rest of the decor. In a small room with low ceilings, for example, do n't hang several large pictures close together. Dark walls are good backdrops for monochrome works, line pen and ink drawings, or strong linear architectural prints. When hanging pictures over or near furniture, relate the frames and subject matter to the furniture, perhaps aligning them in a symmetrical arrangement by matching the two woods or by tying the mat to the upholstery color. If your double bed lacks a headboard, hang a large picture or group of pictures above the bed. Make sure the edges of the picture do n't extend beyond the edges of the furniture beneath it. When a picture is hung alone, it should be at eye level; when it is part of a group, choose a darker, broader or heavier-looking frame to give extra weight to one element. A group of framed artworks may be improved by exploiting an interplay of shapes, says Miss Clifton-Mogg. Introduce a circle, oval or lozenge shape among the squares and rectangles for a surprisingly dramatic effect. Framed family photographs often are displayed on a table or mantel in a mix of old and new frames. And, often, small knick-knacks are mixed in a style that is particularly appealing in country-style rooms. Photographs and small works also are hung in hallways and staircases. The Professional Picture Framers Association offers these tips to protect the artwork: _ Use acid-free matting and adhesives to prevent deterioration. _ If framing needlework, have it mounted so it can be removed without harming the needlework. Lacing is one such method. _ For three-dimensional objects, such as medals, use ultraviolet glass to protect art from the sun's rays.

 If you're thinking of updating your bathroom, you're among an estimated 7 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> households with similar plans. A survey in late 1987 for the trade magazine Kitchen and Bath Business indicated that between 5.2 million and 6.5 million baths would be remodeled during 1988. The 25,000 consumers surveyed showed the total dollar outlay for the remodeling would range from $ 8.9 billion to $ 11.6 billion, says <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, executive editor. Last year, consumers spent $ 8.3 billion on bath remodeling by professionals. About 70 percent remodeled a master bath; 41 percent remodeled another bath; 21 percent remodeled a half-bath, and 7 percent added a master bedroom bath. Thirteen percent added a full bath and 8 percent added a powder room. Nine percent enlarged an existing bath. `` For many years, almost no one paid any attention to the bath,'' says <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>. `` It was strictly a utility area and the focus was to get all the equipment into the smallest possible space.'' Now, he says, the bath has become a kind of focus of the two-person household. Typically, he says, between $ 3,000 and $ 6,000 is spent to redo a bath, although many jobs are on a much smaller scale. For $ 300, he says, consumers may put in a new sink or new faucets, a new vanity or mirrored medicine cabinet. In general, people want heaters, ventilation equipment, skylights _ especially in windowless baths and in baths with small windows _ and cabinetry for more storage The more expensive remodelings may substitute a whirlpool for a standard bath, or add exercise equipment, even a small refrigerator, cooktop and bar sink. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> interior designer <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> says some clients want a luxurious bath with a whirlpool or steam shower and amenities ranging from heated towel racks and extra heaters to bidets, piped-in music and lighting on dimmers. `` The transformation of the bath into a luxury room is partly a result of interest in fitness, partly a response to stressful times,'' she says. `` Some people have the disposable income to create a spa environment at home. It's less expensive than actually going to a spa and home hydrotherapy can be justified as a luxury because it has a health component.'' Her biggest problem as a designer, she says, is space. `` What people want in a bathroom today takes more than 5-by-7 feet,'' she says. She advises increasing space by invading another room or taking a closet. Among the more popular new bath additions, she says, is a steam shower with a folding seat. She may hide the steam generator and controls in a vanity so the unit looks like an ordinary stall shower. One company makes a prefabricated sauna that fits into a space just less than 4 feet square. According to Finnleo, which imports the dry-heat units from <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, no plumbing and little carpentry is required if the space is available. Cost is about $ 2,000. If the addition of all this equipment leads to a closed-in feeling, mirrors can expand visual space and recessing storage units can help alleviate the problem.

 Redecorating with wallcoverings has become a popular do-it-yourself project and manufacturers are encouraging the trend by offering more coordinated patterns and borders in wallpaper books. At the retail level, many shops offer guidance on how to hang the covering and what types of adhesives to use. Retailers suggest you order all the wallcoverings you need at the same time so they are all from the same color run. Before starting the job, check the lot numbers before unwrapping the rolls and inspect the full length of each roll before you cut it. If there are damaged rolls, return them. Consider what is on the walls in adjacent rooms before deciding on color and pattern. You can choose a covering in a similar color, with the same pattern scale or with the same `` feeling'' in mind, such as a small floral pattern that coordinates with a larger, bolder floral in the same colors. In general, light colors, textures and small overall prints are unobtrusive, while large, splashy prints, shiny and metallic papers dramatize space. To minimize bad walls, choose a low-gloss, textured covering or a large overall print as long as it is n't shiny Small and dark rooms will seem more spacious if you choose pale colors and small patterns. Lower a ceiling by covering it in a bright color or strong pattern. Limit the use of a bold print by papering a foyer or hall or small bath, since large, busy expanses of any pattern can become tiresome. When it's time to apply the wallcovering, cover the pasting table with plain brown wrapping paper or inexpensive tablecloths or dropcloths. Do n't use newspapers because the ink may come through to the new covering. If you're working on top of old wallpaper, it's best to strip it from the wall. Strippable or vinyl wallpaper peel off easily when you grasp a corner and pull. Wash the walls with warm water and scrape off the remaining glue with a putty knife after you've done the stripping. If the wallpaper to be covered is in good, tight condition, you can paper over it. At worst, rent a wallpaper steamer or apply wallpaper remover. They soften the paper so you can scrape it off with a wide putty knife. After scraping, wash the walls and allow them to dry before hanging the new wallcovering. For a better-looking job, work slowly and do n't try to finish the projct in one day. Wallcovering paste dries slowly enough so that you can adjust a strip and eliminate seam mismatches and bubbles, if necessary. Save extra wallpaper, which can be used to fix small tears and loose edges without repapering. For loose seams, apply the paste to both the wall and the wallpaper, press the paper in place, smooth it with a seam roller and then wipe away the extra paste. To patch a small damaged area, paste a new piece of wallcovering larger than the tear over the damaged areas, matching the patterns exactly. Allow the patch to set, but not to dry entirely. Then, cut through both areas, clean the empty area and repaste the top piece. Wait 15 minutes and roll the edges smooth. Other ways to use wallpaper: _ If there is a pattern, cut out some of the motifs and apply them to lampshades and accessories. _ Wallpaper a closet. _ Create custom waste receptacles, perhaps from large round ice cream cartons or plastic or metal wastepaper cans. _ Use wallpaper inserts on kitchen cabinets, bathroom counter tops. _ Use for picture frames. _ Wallpaper borders can update and enliven old furniture. Just glue them on.

 The difference between a room that looks right and one that looks all wrong may be a matter of scale. When <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>, decorating editor of <ORGANIZATION> Ladies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, surveyed eight common decorating mistakes, she found seven involved errors of scale, mainly combining furnishings in mismatched sizes. Scale, according to Glass, refers to the size of objects and their relationship to each other and the space around them. A room works better, she says, if the objects are on the same general level. For examples of good scale, check out model rooms in stores and in decorating magazines and books, noting the relative sizes of major pieces of furniture and accessories. Some typical errors of judgment include selecting armchairs that are too shallow and too high-backed for the sofa in the room; choosing end tables that are too narrow and too high for the seating; placing a coffee table that is too small in front of a sofa; using lamps that tower over the furniture and accessories. By keeping a set of general decorating guidelines on hand when you go shopping, you may be able to eliminate all or most of these errors. A sofa should measure a little less than half the length of the wall it is placed against. -LRB- If the room is large enough, try placing a love seat on one side of the sofa and an upholstered chair on the other. -RRB- For toss cushions to go with the upholstery, choose a 20 - or 24-inch square for a standard-depth upholstered piece Tables next to the sofa should be about a quarter to one-third the length of the sofa and their height no more than 4 inches taller than the top of the arms of the sofa. Instead of choosing two matched end tables, select different styles; for example, an antique chest or a skirted table for one and a standard rectangular table for the other. A coffee table should be about half the length of the sofa and at a comfortable height in relation to the sofa seat. An alternative to the single large coffee table is two matching smaller ones with a little space between them. An area rug should be large enough to generously border the coffee table. A painting above the sofa should be about the size of the coffee table top. To camouflage empty corners in a room, use an interesting panelled folding screen, one or more large plants or a large piece of furniture.

 A growing interest in traditional interiors has helped pave the way for the return of the grandfather clock to a place of honor in many American homes. Originally known as a tall or a long case clock -LRB- it is still so called in the antique circuit -RRB-, it became a `` grandfather clock'' because of the popularity of the song, `` My Grandfather's Clock,'' around 1875. According to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Snellenburg </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Christie </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and a specialist in clocks and watches, interest in buying grandfather clocks is high, though the clocks do n't get much publicity Sales figures indicate such clocks are highly desirable home accessories, he says. Those seeking a grandfather clock for the home have to compete with serious collectors of fine American furniture as well as clock fanciers who are interested in the development of horology. <PERSON> Snellenburg </PERSON> says there are plenty of grandfather clocks to go around, however. The most important consideration in selecting an antique clock is the condition of both the case and the works. Clocks are usually survivors, he says, and unless one has been especially abused, it probably can be put in good working order. A good quality English long case clock dating from the 18th century or early 19th century costs from $ 1,000 to $ 3,500 at an auction. The clock is likely to feature a painted white dial, often with an arch, and a case of mahogany or oak. The same clock might cost $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 in an antiques store, says <PERSON> Snellenburg </PERSON>. American clocks from the same era tend to be more expensive, especially if signed by a famous maker. It would not be uncommon to find prices of $ 40,000 to $ 100,000 for a signed <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> family clock, he says. American country clocks might range from $ 4,000 to $ 10,000. <PERSON> Snellenburg </PERSON> recommends considering grandfather clocks that are neither antique nor new. `` Some of the 80-year-old clocks are a very good buy now,'' he says. `` They have good movements and are usually copies of the traditional English style.'' When buying an old clock, choose a reputable dealer. If buying from a dealer who does n't normally deal in clocks, ask a specialist to look at it before you buy. Old clocks most likely have appreciated in value as they age and are likely to continue to appreciate if they are in good condition. But there are advantages to buying a new grandfather clock. Today's clocks offer more features, as well as sizes appropriate for today's interiors. They are dependable as timekeepers and offer such features as triple chimes, ornate pendulums and a beveled glass section to reveal the interior workings. Prices for new grandfather clocks range from $ 600 to $ 7,000, depending on complexity of design, size and expense of materials _ rare burls, carvings, beveled glass, gold-plated dials. Bigger movements cost more. Most contemporary grandfather clocks play as many as three different melodies or chimes, says <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Few of the old clocks are truly musical; they tell the time and strike the hour Contemporary clocks chime the whole tune on the hour and partial tune on the quarter, half and three-quarter hour. The melodies are based on church chimes. For example, the Westminster chimes are taken from a portion of the `` Messiah,'' by <PERSON> Handel </PERSON>, as rendered at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Big Ben; the <LOCATION> Whittinton </LOCATION> chimes are from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bow </ORGANIZATION>. In clocks that play three melodies, the chimes are like a music box, with a selection lever. You can set the tune you want to hear.

 There are almost as many prescriptions for choosing attractive color combinations as there are colors. Some suggest selecting color schemes by looking in your clothes closet and picking colors you enjoy wearing. One advises a trip to the supermarket to buy fruits and vegetables and taking them home to `` play'' with until you decide on a combination you like. Another idea is to use a favorite painting to identify colors you enjoy living with. Whatever method you choose, finding the colors you like is only the first hurdle. There are problems that come up no matter what colors you decide on, says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pile </PERSON>, author of `` Interior Design.'' Pile says many people select too many colors for one room; their `` rainbow coalition'' becomes too chaotic and random. Or they choose an intense color _ like fire engine red _ for large areas. Others, he says, eschew bright colors altogether and choose safe neutrals, resulting in dull, uninviting rooms. The answer, says Pile, is to learn which color schemes work and then adapt them to your own environment and color preferences. Color harmony is a key to color schemes. The easiest color schemes to duplicate are harmonious schemes that includes monochromatic and analogous combinations. Monochromatic schemes use a single color in a variety of hues; neutrals like white, beige and gray predominate. An example would be a room in which various shades of blue or red were combined. Any possible monotony could be relieved by colorful artwork, accessories or even the costumes of the occupants, Pile says. Analogous color schemes use hues closer together on the color wheel. Examples are blue with blue-green, or blue-violet or green with blue-green and yellow-green. Complementary schemes use hues from opposite ends of the color wheel: red with green, orange with blue, yellow with violet. But safeguard against over-brightness by choosing a quiet hue for one of the color and covering large areas with it. Texture, pattern and shine affect the appearance of colors, as does the placement of one color in relation to the others. Light colors appear lighter when seen against a darker background; dark colors become darker against a light background. A medium tone can be made to seem either light or dark by its contrast with its surroundings. Warm colors advance and appear closer; cool colors appear to recede. Placing sharply contrasting colors together can cause a sense of vibration. These optical illusions can be used to make small spaces seem larger and to render oddly shaped rooms less noticeable. A long, narrow room, for example, will seem shaped more normally if end walls are painted a strong, warm color, while side walls are painted a light, cool color. A dark ceiling will seem lower than the same ceiling in a light tone. Painting a door and wall the same color will cause it to blend into the room. Painting them different colors will make them stand out. Knowing how colors appear and react with other colors can help you choose a color scheme that not only appeals to your senses but also minimizes flaws and creates an atmosphere that can be calm, restful, stimulating, exciting or dignified. In general, it is suggested you select the dominant colors first. These are the hues that will occupy the largest spaces, whether floors, walls or ceilings. Then consider the secondary areas, such as furniture, window treatments and accessories. Add small streams of color in strong values as accents in the form of throw cushions and artwork.

 There's an unusually wide choice these days with upholstered furniture, as the fashionable style variations range from the formality of 19th-century parlors through the simplicity of country kitchen or porch to the ageless look of fine leather. A fashionable interest in novelty conjures an image of an adventurous hostess entertaining in a room made to look like the inside of an Indian wigwam, a Parisian sewer or a 1950s American diner. The 19th-century style appears to be the way to go. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON>, editor of 1,001 Home Ideas magazine, says that at the recent furniture market in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, there was a return to dressmaker details reminiscent of the Victorian era, with contrast welting, bows, beautifully detailed skirts, a slipcover look on furniture that is actually upholstered, and pleats and double ruffles. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Herring </PERSON>, vice president of <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON>, a fabric supplier to high end furniture companies, also endorsed the 19th century as a treasure trove of ideas for today. His company is preparing a `` Natchez'' collection dominated by high-style Victorian _ watermark silks, damasks, brocades, moires and velvets with embossed effects. According to <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, more formality in fabrics is the watchword. Besides the damasks and brocades of traditional luxury, needlepoint and tapestry fabrics are growing popular _ at the expense of casual stripes, plaids and textured fabrics that have been a mainstay over the past several years. Among the most popular fabrications in the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> showroom this spring were upholstered pieces covered in medium green moire velvet and ruby red figured damask. Extensive multicolored fringe and braid trim were applied to the pieces. For the future, <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> is betting on the ethnic look. `` By and large,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Herring </ORGANIZATION>, `` American consumers have become more sophisticated and are often influenced by museum exhibitions such as the <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON> exhibition at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON>'s ethnic collection will be based on Peruvian and Inca documents in the American Museum of Natural History. Its introduction this fall will coincide with the opening of a new museum wing devoted to those cultures. According to <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON>, leather remains very popular. She advises care, however, in choosing leather furniture. Try to make sure the leather will keep its good looks over the year and not crack, she says. What's out? Mauve apparently is being recolored to look like rose in many fabric lines. And there is an increase in green at the expense of blue. Should you care what's in and what's not? Not necessarily. But if you are redecorating over several years, it will be easier to find coordinating accessories if you choose something that is beginning its time rather than at its end.

 Furniture bargains are out there, somewhere, says a prominent furniture restorer _ `` They're just hiding where you'd least expect to find them.'' One way to find them, says <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Formby </PERSON>, is to run an ad in the local newspaper announcing, `` I Buy Used Furniture.'' It's better to say `` used'' furniture rather than `` antique,'' he says, to keep prices reasonable. Then make appointments with callers and go out on weekend `` treasure hunts.'' `` You'd be surprised at the number of people who have $ 20,000 worth of old furniture stuck in a dusty attic or musty basement,'' says <PERSON> Formby </PERSON>. Other places to look: `` Flea markets, junk shops and auctions... real estate sales and garage sales Often, people have lived with this furniture all their lives, and they're eager to get rid of it. `` Take your time looking, and be thorough. Look in all the nooks and crannies _ even behind doors.'' <PERSON> Formby </PERSON> says furniture does n't have to be 100 years old to be worth restoring. `` I've come across a lot of 50 - and 60-year-old reproductions worth as much, or more, than some 100-year-old antiques,'' he says `` So think twice before passing over any piece that's made of solid wood.''

 You can save money and still have custom touches when remodeling your kitchen, says <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Krengel </PERSON>, a kitchen designer. Some tips from <PERSON> Krengel </PERSON>, who is design director of the <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kitchen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ideas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>: _ Instead of buying a ready-made floor-to-ceiling pantry, combine two ready-made base cabinets by stacking one on top of the other. Use the base cabinet with drawers right side up on the bottom, then top it with a two-door base cabinet turned upside down with its toe kick space removed. Base cabinets are deeped than top cabinets, so you can get more canned goods and staples into the door cabinet than you could with an above-counter cabinet. If there's still room, use the cabinet top to hold an attractive, but seldom used serving dish or salad bowl. If the cabinet top is close to the ceiling, install molding to hide the edges and give a built-in look. _ Attach wall cabinets to the sides or back of a work island or dining island in the kitchen. The cabinets can provide foot-deep storage and if you use 42-inch high units behind a 35-inch high island, the work area is hidden from view. _ For a decorative way of storing staples, buy a 15-by-30-inch or 18-by-30-inch glass door cabinet and turn it on its side. The glass door will then open out and down and can be fitted with tilt-out bins for staples such as beans, peas, rice, macaroni, snacks _ even dog biscuits. _ For more storage space for narrow items, re-cover the wasted space between the wall studs. The space, about 3 -LCB- inches deep, is behind the sheetrock walls. It can be exposed and then painted or lined with patterned adhesive-backed plastic to house spices, canned goods, glasses and other skinny items. _ If you do n't want to eliminate a window, but it is keeping you from installing a needed storage cabinet, consider installing a cabinet with glass sides in front of the window. Then place items like glasses in the cabinet so that the light and view are diffused but not altogether removed. _ If a window is too low and you want to put a counter in front of it, cut out the counter in front of the window so that a narrow well is created. You can use the well to hold plants, or herbs and spices.

 An attractive table setting, it is said, enhances a meal.

Or it can make a statement all its own. It offers great flexibility when mixing and matching patterns.'' As for crystal, the `` crowning jewel of your table,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kolator </PERSON> advises: `` A more heavily cut crystal is best when joined with simple dinnerware.

 Toothpaste and credit cards are among the `` tools'' a furniture restorer says can use to clean up water spots, cigarette burns or gashes on wood finishes. Toothpaste, says <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Formby </PERSON>, is a gentle abrasive and can be used to remove water spots and rings on wood furniture. Just squeeze toothpaste on to a wet cotton rag and buff the spotted area, he says. For stubborn rings, combine the toothpaste with equal parts of baking soda. For cigarette burns, dip a cotton swab into nail polish remover and rub it lightly across the burned area. If any discoloration remains, scrape it gently with a pen knife. If a slight hollow is left, mix equal parts nail polish remover with clear nail polish and apply the mixture with the nail polish brush. Allow each coat to dry for several minutes until the hollow is filled; it may take seven or eight coats. For scratches, melt a crayon the color of your wood finish and let the colored wax drip into the gash until it overflows, says <PERSON> Formby </PERSON>. Let the melted crayon dry 30 minutes and use a credit card to gently shave off the residue.

 More than 11 million women are currently working from home, either full time or part time, according to a 1987 survey by Link Resources, a New York-based consulting firm. As a result, finding room for a work-at-home office has become a common remodeling goal. To ensure that work at home is satisfying rather than frustrating, it is important to set up a special place dedicated to the work, says <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, author of `` Women and Home-Based Work: The Unspoken Contract.'' If there's no space for a separate office, use part of another room _ but redo the space so it functions as a real work space. Interior designer <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> suggests using a corner of a room that is large enough for a small desk and two chairs. Create visual separation by removing personal items such as knickknacks and family photographs. Instead, hang your diplomas, certificates and other documents on the wall near the desk. Paint or wallpaper the office area in a slightly different shade from the rest of the room. For example, if your walls are white, cover the office wall with a striped wallpaper with an off-white background. Conceal the space for privacy, or when not in use, by enclosing it with one or two three-paneled screens in a neutral color. If your work does not require client visits, consider converting a closet into an office work space. Remove the door and use the closet space for shelving, file cabinets and other supplies. Few closets are roomy enough to accommodate a desk as well, but you can place a desk next to the closet at right angles to it. Cabinets or shelving used to create an L-shape or small separate work area can also serve the same purpose, while adding work storage space at the same time. Home office designers say that storage and other needs vary, depending on the tools you will use. In general, plan for a telephone and a typewriter or personal computer and printer. All need electrical outlets. The most comfortable height for typing at a typewriter or computer keyboard is 3 to 4 inches lower than standard desk height. If it is impossible to provide a surface for that, use a desk chair with an adjustable height. If you're working with computers, you're likely to find that computer desks and storage components -LRB- either custom-made or ready-made -RRB- work best. If you plan to place computer equipment on a desk, be sure to measure first and take into account the depth needed for installation. Do n't forget to allow for the bulky wires and plugs at the back of the components. When planning the location of the printer, allow space for continuous feed paper. Good lighting is essential for any task, including desk work. Choices of light sources vary from floor and table lamps to adjustable desk lamps with goosenecks and spotlights. But most important is to have the light fall on the work, not on the worker. Avoid glare by proper placement of the light. For a desk chair, choose seating that is adjustable in several ways, especially if more than one person will be using the desk. Look for a chair that has an adjustable seat and back height, a tilting back and a contoured seat and casters for added mobility.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher in Europe, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was higher in late-morning European trading today, though dealers said its rise had been temporarily halted by West German central bank intervention. The <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> started selling dollars for West German marks early in the session to stem the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's rise and dealers said the market was not fazed initially. But by late morning, the intervention had at least temporarily halted the dollar's advance. `` It has put the dollar under control,'' said one trader in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. The dollar was boosted late Friday by good <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment data for July, which fueled market speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will raise interest rates soon. Higher interest rates make the dollar a more attractive investment. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.85 Japanese yen to a closing 133.97. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted slightly lower at 133.93 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.9004 West German marks, up from 1.8890; 1.5887 Swiss francs, up from 1.5757; 6.4085 French francs, up from 6.3675; 2.14575 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1315; 1,400.75 Italian lire, up from 1,393.00; 1.2078 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2050 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6915 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.6977 late Friday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 431.60 a troy ounce and at mid-morning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 431.85. Both prices were down from Friday's late bid of $ 432.10 In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 431.90, down from $ 433.00 late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid $ 434.00, up a penny from Saturday's $ 433.99. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today at a bid price of $ 6.80 a troy ounce, down from Friday's $ 6.89.

<HEAD>To Maintain Growth, Condom Companies Targeting Women Buyers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New for PMs.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LITTLE FALLS, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The condom market is leveling off after heavy growth spurred by fear of AIDS, and the nation's two biggest manufacturers hope to maintain consumer interest by targeting female buyers, according to industry officials. <ORGANIZATION> Carter-Wallace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Schmid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> plan soon to release products in feminine-style packaging that they hope will encourage more women to buy the prophylactics. Women account for an estimated 40 percent of condom purchases, industry experts say. <ORGANIZATION> Schmid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-biggest condom seller with 35 percent of the market, wants to shore up declining sales by appealing to them Last month, the company laid off 150 temporary workers at its <LOCATION> Anderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, manufacturing plant because of a drop in demand. One reason for the slower sales was the higher prices condom manufacturers recently began paying for <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> latex used to make most of the products. Officials also say new regulations by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> have trimmed profit margins by mandating a tenfold increase in condom testing. <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON> president <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> said sales remain strong, but are not near the lofty numbers that followed Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s advice last year to use condoms to avoid transmitting acquired immune deficiency syndrome. `` People realized the initial impact was not going to continue forever,'' <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> said of the sales surge. `` But we are at a higher production level now than pre-AIDS.'' <ORGANIZATION> Diana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> analyst who follows <ORGANIZATION> Carter-Wallace </ORGANIZATION>, says women can be important to the market if more begin relying on condoms for contraception, as recent studies show they are. `` I think -LRB- sales -RRB- are moderating,'' Ms. <PERSON> Temple </PERSON> said. `` People appear to be buying them. The key is if they are using them.'' Condom company officials would not estimate the dollar amount of their sales but said the industry estimates it will sell about $ 404 million worth of condoms in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year, which Ms. <PERSON> Temple </PERSON> said would represent a 20 percent rise in sales. To maintain consumer interest, <ORGANIZATION> Carter-Wallace </ORGANIZATION>, which controls half of the market, soon will be marketing <ORGANIZATION> Trojans </ORGANIZATION> for Women, spokeswoman <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Stecher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON> soon will introduce <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> for Her and She's Sheik condoms, variations on two of the company's top-selling lines. Among the added feminine touches in the new products are a carrying case for each condom and disposable envelopes. `` The emphasis now is on educating young people to use condoms if they are sexually active and non-monogomous. We think young women are more likely to respond to this than young men,'' <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Dollar Rebounds In Tokyo, Stocks Continue Slide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar regained lost ground against the Japanese yen today in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, while stock prices accumulated further losses. The dollar closed the day at 133.97 yen, up a strong 0.85 yen from its close Friday at 133.12 yen. It traded briefly today at a high of 134.05 yen. `` The dollar moved up mainly because of the activity around the West German mark,'' said a dealer at a major Japanese securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity. The dollar rose to a 19-month high against the deutsche mark in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Friday, propped up in part by strong earnings and payroll figures in the July <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment report released last week. According to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's jobless rate rose to 5.4 percent in July from a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in June. In a separate report, the department said the number of non-farm payrolls in June was revised upward, showing much stronger job creation than preliminary figures indicated. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, the Nikkei average of 225 selected issues, a 60.20-point loser during Saturday's half-day session, slid a further 109.60 points, or 0.38 percent, to close the day at 28,253.12 points. Dealers said the market was plagued by interest rate concerns continuing from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment report. Volume on the first section of the exchange was estimated at 600 million shares, down from 800 million shares Friday, the most recent full day of trade.

<HEAD>Farm Sales to Asia Expected to Rise $2 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm sales to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> are expected to rise by $ 2 billion this fiscal year, according to the latest forecast from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. The increase, which should bring agricultural sales to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> to $ 10 billion or $ 11 billion a year, will come during an overall expansion of farm exports to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> says. It says farm exports to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> also are likely to increase and cites the lower dollar as one major reason. <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> sales probably will account for nearly one-third of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports this fiscal year, according to a department report. Farm production declined in most of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> last year, the report said. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, it said, rice consumption is down, in part because of urban growth and a stronger economy. But at the same time, wheat consumption is on the upswing, both because of changed eating habits and increased use of wheat as feed for livestock. Similarly, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s coarse grain consumption is expected to increase 6 percent because of large livestock inventories, strong industrial use and eased South Korean quotas. Drought plaguing the Farm Belt remains an uncertainty, the report said. It said the heat and lack of grain should reduce soybean production, but it also said long-term prospects for soybean exports to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> appear promising. Fast-food restaurants and higher incomes are expected to increase East Asian consumption of meat over the long term but higher livestock feed costs and lower meat product prices mean growth of production should be slow this year, the report said. It said the key to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to the market depends on East Asian access to the American textile and clothing markets. Easing of Japanese restrictions on beef imports also is expected to spur consumer demand, according to the analysis.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is continuing to open emergency programs to additional farmers as drought spreads. <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> are the latest states declared eligible for <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> emergency loans because of drought-related crop losses. The order from Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> applied to all 23 counties in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and all 55 counties in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. To be eligible farmers must have crop insurance if available to offset crop losses, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said. They also must be able to repay the loan and any other loans they have outstanding and be unable to obtain credit elsewhere, the statement said. It said adequate security would be required. Designation of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> brought the number of entire states eligible to eight. The others are <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. `` This disaster designation only makes FmHA emergency loans available in the affected counties and does not ensure family farmers eligibility for such loans,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said in letters to governors of the states. Thus far, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has approved hay cutting and grazing on <ORGANIZATION> Acreage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and Conservation Use Acreage as well as hay cutting on sound-alike but separate Conservation Reserve Program land in 2,184 counties in 42 states, the department said Friday. It said hay cutting on <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> lands has been approved in 191 counties in 11 states. Livestock feed aid programs have been approved for 1,600 counties in 37 states, the department said. It said a program under which farmers get 92 percent of their payments while producing no crop have been authorized for 107 counties in 21 states.

 Rock' n' rollers have <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>, sports fans have <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> and investors have the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. Now, there's RFD-TV for farmers _ an idea its developers hope will reap a bountiful harvest of profits `` We're a whole new concept and we're delivering stories that no one else is delivering,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottsch </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the satellite network scheduled to go on the air Aug. 15. `` It seems like there's always something going on with agriculture,'' he said. `` But one problem is farmers are not getting accurate or timely information on a daily basis or even an hourly basis.'' RFD-TV hopes to change that with 24-hour, seven-day a week programming available to households with a satellite dish, <PERSON> Gottsch </PERSON> said in a recent interview, as workers scrambled to build sets and uncrate equipment in time for the network premiere. He said plans call for RFD-TV, named after the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service's old acronym for rural free delivery, to grow like the crops that will be its subject matter, expanding to cable and low-power television systems. <PERSON> Gottsch </PERSON>, who was raised on a farm near <LOCATION> Elkhorn </LOCATION> and later worked as a commodity broker and satellite dish dealer, said he came up with the idea for RFD-TV about three years ago. There are 2.8 million home satellite dishes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 250,000 in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. About 60 percent are in rural areas, <PERSON> Gottsch </PERSON> said. `` It's just a common sense project,'' he said. `` If you take a drive in the country you see a lot of dishes and they're going to be watching us.'' The programming wo n't be reruns of `` Hee-Haw,'' `` The Real McCoys'' or `` <LOCATION> Mayberry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> R.F.D. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gottsch </PERSON> said. He described the network as a cross between the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, but geared toward rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Universities in all 50 states will produce shows for RFD-TV and a live prime-time interview show in which viewers may phone in questions is planned. RFD-TV also will have its own barnyard take-off on home shopping _ video livestock auctions to give farmers a chance to expand their herds without leaving their living rooms, <PERSON> Gottsch </PERSON> said. `` We're very confident people are going to like what they see on our air _ we're not doing things half-cocked,'' <PERSON> Gottsch </PERSON> said. `` They're going to see a very shiny farm network that they're going to want to watch.'' The fledgling Omaha-based network has a 21-member news staff, with bureaus in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gottsch </PERSON> said. The staff will produce seven hours of live news, weather and markets coverage every week day, and several half-hour summaries daily. `` Currently, agricultural programming is scattered throughout the television system,'' <PERSON> Gottsch </PERSON> said. `` There is hit-and-miss coverage on local stations and some largely irrelevant feature material on the major networks.'' Advertisers and home satellite dish dealers are excited about the network. `` There is a definite ` What do we have to lose?' attitude among major advertisers,'' <PERSON> Gottsch </PERSON> said. `` Because of satellite communications, our ad rates are lower than a local TV station.'' Agricultural advertisers also have been supportive because `` there's a need for a rifle shot approach to the farmer instead of the shotgun approach,'' he said. Because RFD-TV is a free, unscrambled service, the network could spur lagging satellite dish sales, <PERSON> Gottsch </PERSON> said. `` We're the first free and clear channel on satellite in the last two years. We're good news for the home satellite dealer. We are definitely a reason for someone to buy home dish,'' he said. Despite high start-up costs of more than $ 3 million, <PERSON> Gottsch </PERSON> predicted the channel will turn a profit in its first year. `` We have built-in shows with built-in audiences with built-in advertisers,'' said <PERSON> Gottsch </PERSON>, who is among the network's investors. `` We only have to sell 13 percent of our available ad time to turn a profit.''

<HEAD>It's Not `Junk Mail' to Everyone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It may be `` junk mail'' to some people, but more than one American in four would like to receive more advertising mail, according to a survey done by the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Thirty-one percent of the people surveyed said they found the information in mailed advertising useful, and 27 percent said they would like to receive more, reports <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wargo </PERSON>, assistant postmaster general for marketing. In contrast, 15 percent said they wish they received less advertising in the mail. Third-class has been the fastest-growing category of mail in recent years, raising the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service to the status of the nation's third largest advertising medium, trailing only newspapers and television, said <PERSON> Wargo </PERSON>. `` The reason that we're in business is because of the receivers, and we need to find out what they want and we need to tell the senders,'' <PERSON> Wargo </PERSON> said of the survey covering 5,300 homes across the nation. The study, done last year, was disclosed to business mailers at a meeting in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and later discussed by <PERSON> Wargo </PERSON> in an interview. He said the study found that the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> handles 17 percent of advertising, compared to 27 percent for newspapers and 22 percent for television. `` We believe that we've got a better opportunity to grow if our receivers are satisfied, they react favorably, and they read it. What were trying to do is help the sender improve their ability to get a favorable reaction and more business. And that's going to keep us in business. It's a straight business proposition.'' Third-class advertising mail increased 173 percent between 1972 and 1987, while other categories increased by only 44 percent. For the average household, third class mail went from three items a week in 1972 to 8.7 last year. Over the same period the volume of first-class mail per household went up from 7.4 to 8.6 items a week, while newspapers and magazines dropped from 2.3 to 1.6, according to <PERSON> Wargo </PERSON>'s study. But while Americans are getting more advertising mail, do they read it? As volume increased, readership has declined, <PERSON> Wargo </PERSON> found. Last year 51 percent of third-class mail was read, according to the study, down from 83 percent in 1972. The higher the household income, the more advertising mail received, but the less that was read, the study found. And yet the higher income households were more likely to order something, and ordered more often via mail. The most important factor in getting someone to open the ad, read it and perhaps buy something, <PERSON> Wargo </PERSON> found, was familiarity with the advertiser. `` The highest open-and-read rate is a result of the person knowing who the company is and having done business with them,'' said <PERSON> Wargo </PERSON>. The increase in mail advertising places conflicting demands on the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, he said, including a need to see that those receiving the mail are not offended or bothered by it. `` I think there are going to be some senders who say, ` Your job is only to take what we give you.' I do n't think we're going to accept that. On the other hand the receivers are going to say, ` You should screen everything' and I do n't think were going to do that,'' <PERSON> Wargo </PERSON> said. `` We're very, very concerned that if this audience does not continue to have a high level of satisfaction we wo n't have anything to sell to'' other advertisers, he said.

<HEAD>Filmmaking More Dangerous Now, Says Stunt Accident Attorney</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A lawyer seeking legislation to promote safety on movie sets says filmmaking is more dangerous now than when three people were killed on the set of `` Twilight Zone: The Movie.'' With pressure for bigger and more spectacular special effects in movies, attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON> says stuntmen and women are risking injury and death daily. `` First they were jumping out of cars. Then it was jumping off buildings, then out of airplanes. Next it will be the Concorde,'' said <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON>. `` I think <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> is more dangerous today than ever.'' <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON>, who is handling six lawsuits resulting from movie and TV set accidents, says the situation is unlikely to change without legislation. `` The ` Twilight Zone' focused public attention on safety,'' <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON> said of the 1987 trial that ended with the acquittal of director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> and four co-defendants on involuntary manslaughter charges. `` But the public got to watch <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> being acquitted, and the question is was that an acquittal of the industry? I say he was on trial and not the industry. `` If we learned anything from ` Twilight Zone,' it's that the criminal justice system is n't going to make the industry safer,'' said <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON>. `` We have to do it some other way.'' He is pushing for passage of a bill that would require licensing of stunt coordinators and special effects coordinators and would forbid moviemakers to use film footage of any stunt that resulted in injury or death. One of <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON>'s clients, stuntman <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, was injured in a special effects explosion during filming of a 1985 action movie. `` The film contains footage of my client getting blown up,'' said <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON>. `` It's just not right.'' `` If filmmakers know they ca n't use that kind of footage,'' said <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON>, `` they will have a financial motivation to make sure the scene is safe when they shoot it.''

<TEXT>
 Six years after <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s deadliest movie accident and a year after a celebrated trial, the `` Twilight Zone'' remains a nagging dilemma for the movie industry. Scrutiny of the helicopter crash that killed veteran actor <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> and two child actors has resumed with the publication of a book about the trial of the director, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Landis </PERSON>, and four co-defendants. Another book on the subject is due next month. Participants still debate details of the crash that occurred July 23, 1982, during filming of a Vietnam War scene for `` Twilight Zone: The Movie.'' The helicopter crashed during special effects explosions, also killing 6-year-old <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Myca </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON>, 7. Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, who successfully defended <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> against manslaughter charges in <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, says the case should be `` over and done with.'' `` The reason it wo n't go away,'' says attorney <PERSON> Harland </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON>, `` is because the system never assessed moral responsibility and no one accepted moral responsibility. `` <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> has never said, ` I did the wrong thing,''' said <PERSON> Braun </PERSON>, who represented associate producer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Folsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> at the trial. Despite a jury's acquittal of <PERSON> Landis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Folsey </PERSON> and the co-defendants of involuntary manslaughter, <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> and two other defense attorneys _ <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, representing special effects coordinator <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Trope </PERSON>, representing pilot <PERSON> Dorcey </PERSON> <PERSON> Wingo </PERSON> _ believe an acknowledgment of responsibility was called for. `` I do n't think much of <PERSON> Landis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>. `` He had a cowardly defense where he blamed everyone else. He never came out and said he was deeply sorry for that which he was responsible for.'' Author <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Labrecque </PERSON>, whose book `` Special Effects'' is due next month, said <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> fuels controversy with his own actions. For example: _ In early summer, <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> gave a dinner party at a trendy <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> restaurant on the first anniversary of his acquittal Attorney <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a guest, said it was a `` nice'' gesture by <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> to thank those who stood by him. _ In June, <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> invited the trial jurors to a private screening of `` Coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> film he directed The jurors accepted, and <PERSON> Landis </PERSON>' action drew more criticism. In their newly published book, `` Outrageous Conduct: Art, Ego and the Twilight Zone Case,'' authors <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Farber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> sharply criticize <PERSON> Landis </PERSON>, the prosecutor who lost the case and the movie industry that failed to penalize <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> for the deaths. `` There are elements of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> that are morally bankrupt,'' said <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. `` They believe only in the bottom line, and as long as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Landis </PERSON>' name is above the title of a movie that is the highest grossing non-sequel in history -LRB- `` Coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' -RRB-, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> will be welcome in those quarters.'' `` No one asks questions,'' said <PERSON> Farber </PERSON>. <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> refused to be comment on the matter. His <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> lawyer, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Behr </PERSON>, said the director was in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and would not comment even if he were here. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> acknowledged his role in the accident when he testified at the trial and should be allowed to `` get on with his life.'' `` They did wrong, and certainly it can be argued they were guilty of violating child labor laws. But it should be over and it should be done with,'' he said. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, his associate, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, who represented production manager <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allingham </PERSON> in the manslaughter trial, have cameo roles in `` Coming To <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Another key player in the `` Twilight Zone'' drama continues to make news. <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> <PERSON> Purwin </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Agostino </PERSON>, the deputy district attorney who spent 10 months prosecuting the case, ran for District Attorney against her boss, <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON>, in June. She lost and has been transferred to a lesser job. She calls the reassignment retaliation. `` No one is letting me forget it,'' she said. `` Probably, because it's <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. But there's also the enormity of the horror, the absolutely needless loss of life for a lousy movie.'' But Chief Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcetti </PERSON> denied the reassigment was vindictive. He said plans to move Mrs. <PERSON> D'Agostino </PERSON> to the other job were made several months ago and were not related to the `` Twilight Zone'' verdict.

 From his farm in the <LOCATION> Berkshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> wages war on small-town autocrats, wresting from them the minutes of meetings that even he admits can make pretty boring reading in his Bulletin. So boring, in fact, that <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> recently cut back publication of his newsletter from twice monthly to once a month. `` I got an inkling that too much was too much,'' he said. But the tree farmer has vowed to keep publishing the recorded gatherings of selectmen, assessors, school and health boards for his 250 readers as long as the money holds out. `` We've been operating in the red and I guess we will always be,'' he said. The not-for-profit newsletter celebrates its first anniversary next month. It has grown to six editions, one for each of the six towns that hand over their minutes, and contains as many minutes as <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> can get. They include such mundane revelations as this, from the May 5 meeting of the <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> board of selectmen: `` Mr. <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> appeared before the board with 104 lbs. of rocks, stating that they had been picked up on 1,000 ft. of road frontage on his property.'' And this, from the May 8 meeting of the <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> health board: `` <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came to request rent for the landfill. She says she was not paid for 1987. We will check.'' About 100 copies are sent free to libraries, post offices and other town offices, but <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> has managed to talk the rest of the subscribers into donations ranging from $ 5 to $ 100. Without such gifts, he said, the paper would not survive. He applies the same persuasive logic to advertisers. Recalling a restaurant that recently pulled a $ 50 ad the size of a business card, <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said: `` I could n't convince them that this is a civic thing. No one is going to come to their restaurant to eat because of that ad. It costs $ 100 to eat there anyway.'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said he founded the newsletter to keep busy in his retirement. He is a former purchasing agent for an electric company who now runs a Christmas tree farm with his wife, <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON>, 72, who heads the board of selectmen in their town. `` I'm 71 and at my age, if you do n't take up something new, your mind begins to fall into pieces,'' he said. The newsletter proudly lists among its supporters two newspapers, a retired publisher and Pulitzer Prize-winning historian <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> MacGregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, who called <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> `` a local friend doing what I think are good things.'' But some apparently disagree. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said officials in a few towns balked at releasing their minutes and complied only after the state attorney general's office told them they were obligated to make the minutes public In at least one case, <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said, his request prompted town officials to take minutes of their meetings for the first time. He said he is still trying to get minutes from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ashford </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> but is loathe to ask the state for help again. `` I'm afraid to stir them up,'' he said of the town officials. `` Then they'll never give them to me.'' The head of the board of selectmen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ashford </LOCATION>, one of the state's smallest towns, with a population of 150 people, said he has refused to mail the minutes to <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>'s home because of the expense. `` The records are there. All he's got to do is come and get them,'' said head selectman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawson </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> board, said she has n't sent minutes to <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> because she has no time to edit them for publication by the time they are typed up, usually several weeks after the meeting `` If he wants, he can sit down at our meetings and take notes,'' she said. `` But I do n't have time to play around with his newsletter. ... It's a sticky situation. I'm not trying to keep anything from him, but I'm a busy woman. I work days and do this -LRB- board business -RRB- at night.'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said he's lost $ 2,500 so far on the newsletter, but he plans to get it up to 20 editions before calling it quits. `` If I can do it here, by <PERSON> George </PERSON>, I can do it anywhere,'' he said.

 Though murder is not one of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s selling points, people are paying for the privilege of reliving some of the city's macabre moments. A tour company with the innocuous name of Sidewalks of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is offering walking tours of murder sites to curiosity seekers who want to know where some of the city's better-known victims took their last breath, according to a report in today's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` I love a good murder,'' publicity agent <PERSON> Marnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said while on her tour last Saturday. The sites in the $ 10 two-hour tour include the Omni Park Hotel on 56th Street and Seventh Avenue, formerly the Park Sheraton, where organized crime figure <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Anastasia </PERSON> was riddled with bullets while getting a shave in a barber shop in 1957. Also featured are the tree in Central Park under which the body of <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> was found two years ago and the <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> building on 72nd Street and Central Park West, where Beatle <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> was murdered.

<HEAD>London Shares Higher; Fall From Peaks On Interest Rate Hike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices were higher early Monday afternoon, but below their best levels as market makers responded to a hike in British interest rates with widespread markdowns. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 2.6 points, or 0.1 percent, at 1,878.5, at about 12:30 p.m., after reaching as much as 9.3 points higher in early trading. The index was up 8.5 points moments before the rate hike flashed across traders' computer screens. Prices rose to their best levels in early business on the back of an early round of buying by institutional investors. Also boosting shares was widespread positive sentiment, reinforced by favorable weekend press comment about <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> equities. But the signal by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> at about midday for a rise in the commercial banks' base lending rate to 11 percent from 10.5 percent pulled shares sharply lower. The rate move, which took the market by surprise, sparked a bit of selling, but markdowns took the biggest toll on shares, a dealer said. Trading activity, after the early morning spurt in buying, tapered off sharply by late morning. Activity was concentrated in a few, selected shares that were the subject of market speculation or brokerage recommendations. Stock exchange volume by midday was a modest 189.3 million shares compared with 252.5 million shares at the same time Friday.

<HEAD>Farmer Aims To Reduce Production Costs, Protect Soil</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Holsapple </PERSON>'s rather unconventional approach to farming began with a simple observation _ one crop can help another crop grow. `` When we plowed down a crop of alfalfa, we had the best corn ever,'' said <PERSON> Holsapple </PERSON>. `` I had been taught to use all these chemicals. That really gets you to thinking.'' So, <PERSON> Holsapple </PERSON> decided five years ago to abandon chemically intensive agriculture and experiment with plants like hairy vetch and rye. They control weeds, add nutrients and organic matter to the soil, and protect the land from erosion _ the natural way, he said. `` The yields have not suffered, in fact they might have picked up a hair,'' said <PERSON> Holsapple </PERSON>, who now raises corn and soybeans with fewer commercial fertilizers and pesticides. `` That's money in your pocket.'' <PERSON> Holsapple </PERSON>, 33, recently showed other interested farmers some of the techniques _ successful and unsuccessful _ that he uses on his 400-acre farm in <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. It is one of 14 farms across the nation cooperating in experiments sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Rodale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Emmanus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, a nonprofit group doing research on regenerative agriculture. `` We need to diversify crops and methods, stop soil erosion and rely less on fossil fuels,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Rodale </ORGANIZATION>'s midwest research coordinator. `` The systems we develop here will be around for our children and our grandchildren.'' During a wagon tour of his farm, <PERSON> Holsapple </PERSON> offered some pointers: _ Fall-planted hairy vetch can be turned under the soil in the spring to supply nitrogen for corn, eliminating the need for that fertilizer in commercial form `` These cover crops do n't let weeds get started in the spring,'' said <PERSON> Holsapple </PERSON>. `` That vetch will even smother out horseweed.'' _ A field of tall, lush corn was cultivated to kill weeds and grasses before they got a good start Herbicides are a last resort. `` You've got to have a rotary hoe or you might as well throw up your hands and go to town,'' said <PERSON> Holsapple </PERSON>, who paid $ 15 for a small used one at a sale. `` If that does n't work, you can always come back and spray later.'' _ A field of dead vetch and little corn demonstrated the problem of planting the grain into the vetch without plowing during a dry year The vetch sucked all the moisture out and the corn did n't germinate <PERSON> Holsapple </PERSON> also experiments with spring peas as a cover crop to provide nitrogen for corn. He raises melons and other produce in small irrigated fields to sell locally. He produces his own seed for vetch, rye and soybeans, buying only commercial hybrid corn seed. And, he adds fertilizers only when a soil test indicates it will be cost effective. `` We just keep trying things,'' said <PERSON> Holsapple </PERSON>. `` The more I do this, the more enthused I get.'' <PERSON> Holsapple </PERSON> said the trial-and-error and the work involved in this kind of farming operation are worthwhile, from a social and economic standpoint. `` There's more profit _ no doubt about it.''

<HEAD>Chubb Offers Farmers Double-Premium Refund</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 3,300 of the 8,717 applicants for insurance by the <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and nine other Midwestern states have accepted the company's offer to refund double their premiums. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> made the offer last month after agents sold $ 400 million in drought insurance coverage to farmers. The underwriter had authorized only $ 30 million worth of the coverage to be sold. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> contends that a flood of applications in the last days the insurance was available caused it to be oversold. The company operated a 125-person telephone bank during the weekend to call 3,500 other applicants, even though the deadline for the double-premium refund expired Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that 852 farmers had accepted the drought insurance policies originally offered and 106 farmers who were offered policies decided instead to take the double-premium offer. Another 359 farmers were ruled ineligible for the insurance because their applications were too late. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> offered up to $ 40 million of insurance nationwide in July to the applicants on a first-come, first-served basis. Other farmers who met the deadline were offered double their premiums back. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> regulators investigating the drought insurance issue will subpoena more people next week to explain how the insurance was marketed. `` More questions have been triggered by some of the testimony we've heard'' during the first week of public meetings, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabe </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>. The department next week will try to sort out which questions remain and who should be called in to answer them, <PERSON> Fabe </PERSON> said. Public meetings will probably resume the following week. The drought insurance was structured to pay farmers for the lack of rain between June 1 and Aug. 31, based on a sliding scale. About 600 <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> farmers applied for the insurance.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s leading commercial banks, heeding a signal from the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>, announced on Monday a half-point increase in their base lending rate to 11 percent. The central bank, seeking to control inflation, has signaled seven half-point increases in the benchmark lending rate since early June, when the rate stood at 7.5 percent. The last increase was announced on July 18. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s annual inflation rate stood at 4.6 percent in June. A spokesman for the central bank, who was n't identified in accordance with British practice, said the latest increase was made to `` assert the counter-inflation strategy.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> said it was the government's view that the economy was growing `` at an unsustainable rate and needed to be slowed down a bit.'' The Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> signaled the rate rise at about midday by announcing that it was raising its own money market rates. <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> quickly raised their base rate. Corporate borrowers can obtain loans at one percentage point above the commercial banks' base lending rate. The pound rose after the announcement, which dealers said took the market by surprise. The pound was selling for $ 1.6960 after the bank's signal, up from $ 1.6915 in late-morning trading.

<HEAD>Hospital Administrators Blame Technology for Rising Health Care
Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many hospital administrators list new technology as a major cause of escalating health-care costs, according to a new poll. The poll appears in the Monday issue of <ORGANIZATION> HealthWeek </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. It was released in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Sunday, the day before the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> was to open its three-day convention here. According to the poll, 32 percent of hospital administrators see technology as the most important contributor to rising health-care costs. In addition to blaming technology for boosting costs, the administrators cited labor costs and salaries -LRB- 20 percent -RRB-, government regulations -LRB- 10 percent -RRB-, personnel shortages, and lack of reimbursement as other leading causes the study reprots. The SRI Gallup poll, conducted by phone among 100 administrators at 27 rural, 38 urban and 35 suburban hospitals across the country, examines issues affecting the delivery of health care services. The poll, which has an error range of plus or minus 9.8 percent, said that 78 percent of the hospital administrators believe the federal government's cost-containment errors are hurting the quality of hospital patient care. Seven in 10 of the respondents said their hospitals make a profit on overall patient revenues, one-third said they did not. Asked if their hospitals make a profit on Medicare patients, 64 percent said they did not. Although 51 percent of the administrators said there has been no substantial change in the difficulty of getting malpractice insurance in the past five years, and 11 percent feel it is easier to get now, 33 percent said it is more difficult to obtain malpractice insurance today. Utilization review, a highly publicized cost-containment practice, has improved the quality of care for 50 percent of the hospitals, but 32 percent of the administrators said the practice had no effect and 17 percent said it had actually hurt the quality of care. Nearly one in four administrators, the largest percentage of respondents to the question, believes the number of AIDS patients will increase by 26 percent or more in the next five years. Four in five believe it is unacceptable for a medical professional to refuse to treat an AIDS patient, the study indicates. Commenting on the nursing shortage, seven in 10 administrators believe it presents a moderate to serious problem. Most administrators, 78 percent, are convinced that substantial pay boosts would have no impact on the nursing shortage according to the poll. <ORGANIZATION> HealthWeek </ORGANIZATION> is a newspaper serving the health industry. SRI Gallup, based in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, is a health-care marketing research firm and is a sister group to the Gallup Organization.

 Grain and soybean futures opened sharply lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to heavier-than-expected weekend showers on the northern and western edges of the Corn Belt. The thunderstorms were expected to roll into the central Midwest today, bringing badly-needed moisture and cooler temperatures to drought-stressed corn and soybean fields. `` The weather over the weekend and the next couple of days looks to be much better than expected,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>.

Traders are anxiously awaiting Thursday's crop progress report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to reveal a worsening of crop conditions during July. In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 5 cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.74 a bushel; corn was 6 -LCB- cents to 10 cents lower with September at $ 2.99 a bushel; soybeans were 21 cents to 31 -LCB- cents lower with the limitless August contract at $ 8.45 a bushel; oats were 4 -LCB- cents to 9 cents lower with September at $ 2.78 -LCB- a bushel.

 Cash-rich <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, announcing its first television station purchase since <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> took over as president nearly two years ago, said today it has agreed to buy WCIX-TV in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for $ 59 million. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said it also agreed to assume certain program obligations valued at about $ 13 million as part of the deal for the station, which operates on Channel 6 in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and is owned by <ORGANIZATION> TVX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. Completion of the deal is subject to regulatory approval. <ORGANIZATION> WCIX </ORGANIZATION> is an independent station, and its acquisition would increase the number of TV stations that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> owns and operates to five, reaching about 20.8 percent of the country. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> also operates the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television network. CBS has faced criticism from its affiliates for failing to expand its station holdings, particularly in light of the $ 3 billion in cash that the company has built up as it sold non-broadcast assets, such as its records and magazines divisions, over the past two years. The companies that own the other two major networks each own more stations. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s parent owns eight stations and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s parent owns seven. <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> has responded by saying that while he wanted to make a station purchase, the prices being asked were too high. CBS currently owns stations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> that reach about 19.4 percent of the country's viewers Federal regulations limit a network to owning no more than 12 stations reaching a maximum 25 percent of the country. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> already has an affiliate in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, but the station, <ORGANIZATION> WTVJ </ORGANIZATION>, was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> last year for about $ 270 million. That station has continued to carry CBS programs, however, under an affiliation agreement that ends in January. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> is the nation's 16th largest television market. `` The exciting and fast-growing <LOCATION> Maimi </LOCATION> market offers a terrific expansion opportunity for us,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Ober </PERSON>, president of the CBS-owned television station division. <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> was quoted in a statement as saying the purchase `` reflects the commitment of the board and senior management to make sound investments in good broadcast properties in attractive local markets.'' `` We are continuing to evaluate other potential properties with an eye toward further acquisitions,'' he said. Ths acquisition would be the second major purchase by <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> in the past four months. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> bought the broadcast rights for 1992 winter Olympics for $ 243 million in May.

 Bond prices were little changed today in quiet dealings as traders geared up for the government's quarterly refunding. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year issue, which fell -RCB- point or $ 7.50 per $ 1,000 in face amount on Friday, was off 1-32 point at midday. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, held at 9.12 percent, unchanged from late Friday. Analysts said they expect traders to snap up the $ 11 billion in three-year notes the government is scheduled to sell on Tuesday. Another $ 11 billion in 10-year issues will be sold the following day. `` While the economy is clearly stronger than people anticipated, and that should knock the bond market down, good buying interest in the refunding is supporting'' the credit markets, said <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Held </ORGANIZATION>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Bondholders worry that a strong economy will bring about higher inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income securities and causes interest rates to rise. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments fell 3-32 point to 1-16 point, intermediate maturities were 1-32 point to 1-16 point lower, and long-term issues were off 5-32 point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. Corporate bonds were slightly higher. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.15 to 283.86. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills slipped to 7.08 percent as the discount rate fell 1 basis point to 6.88 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 7.61 as the discount rose 2 basis points to 7.25. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.03 percent as the discount rose 2 basis points to 7.48 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded at 7 -RCB- percent, up from 7 11-16 percent late Friday.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices were little changed on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Monday after the market stumbled on news of an unexpected hike in British interest rates. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index settled up 0.1 point, or 0.01 percent, at 1,876.0. Trading volume was a light 369.2 million shares, sharply lower than Friday's volume of 416.4 million shares. Most of Monday's trading volume came within the first three hours of business. Prices rose to their best levels in early trading on the back of buying by institutional investors and on widespread positive sentiment, reinforced by favorable weekend press comment about <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> equities. But a signal by the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> for a rise in bank base lending rates to 11 percent from 10.5 percent pulled prices sharply lower after midday. Market watchers said the rate rise caught them completely off guard. `` It was a bolt of lightning from out of the blue,'' one analyst said. Grand Metropolitan PLC, a British liquor and restaurants group, was the largest gainer on the day, jumping 26 pence, or 44 cents, to 522 pence a share after the company said it was considering selling its Inter-Continental Hotels unit.

<HEAD>Drilling To See If City of Culture Sits on Crude Oil</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The City of Light is a treasure trove of cultural, archeological and historical gems. Oil companies hope it also holds black gold. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION> plans to begin drilling an exploratory oil well on the southern doorstep of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Ivry-sur-Seine </LOCATION> _ the first of several wells in a program that also envisions exploring within the city itself. `` I do n't think <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> will ever be <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrot </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elf </PERSON>'s assistant director of exploration in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` But there is still oil to be found in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>.'' The basin is a 50,000-square-mile expanse stretching eastward from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to the West German frontier. Exploration surged in the basin after the discovery in April 1983 of considerable oil deposits at the <LOCATION> Chaunoy </LOCATION> field, which is in a rural region about 50 miles south of the capital best known for its tender white Brie cheese. The Ivry site, barely a mile outside the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> city limits, is being explored under a permit awarded in December 1985 to <LOCATION> Elf </LOCATION>, Total <PERSON> Compagnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Francaise </PERSON> <PERSON> des </PERSON> <PERSON> Petroles </PERSON> and British Petroleum. The 587 square miles covered by the permit includes the city of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where limited seismic tests already have been carried out. It will take as much as four weeks to determine whether <PERSON> Ivry </PERSON> contains marketable reserves, and whether they might extend inside the city. But, <PERSON> Perrot </PERSON> said, `` it is quasi-certain that even with a total failure in <LOCATION> Ivry </LOCATION>, there will be other exploratory wells.'' Total said it definitely will drill an exploratory well, likely before the end of the year. In their exploration campaign, the companies say they have already spent more than the 70 million francs _ about $ 11.6 million _ required under the five-year permit, mostly for seismic tests. There are more than 1,000 exploratory wells in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, which produces nearly two-thirds of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s modest oil output. Some oil also is being pumped from the <LOCATION> Aquitaine </LOCATION> region of southwestern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and, minimally, from <LOCATION> Alsace </LOCATION> on the eastern frontier. All the regions together produce less than 5 percent of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s needs. The <PERSON> Ivry </PERSON> well is the first to be drilled so close to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` If we are encouraged by <PERSON> Ivry </PERSON>, we will be encouraged to do more studies of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON> <PERSON> Poutchkovsky </PERSON>, a spokesman for Elf. `` We could easily find locations'' for derricks within the city, he said. `` Look at the number of wells in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.'' Oil derricks would not rival the Eiffel Tower for attention, though. Experts say stadiums, disused factories or even a discretely moored boat on the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> could serve as sites for horizontal drilling, by which oil is extracted sideways. `` We are looking at all solutions,'' <PERSON> Poutchkovsky </PERSON> said. Limited seismic readings of the capital were carried out in 1986 when specially equipped trucks sounding out the city depths rolled down the Champs Elysees while <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> slept. More extensive seismic readings showed favorable structures in <LOCATION> Ivry </LOCATION>, nearby <LOCATION> Orly </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chenevieres </LOCATION> to the east, and <LOCATION> Roissy </LOCATION> to the north, according to <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> and Total, the two operators on the permit, which gives <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> a 50 percent share, Total 35 percent and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> 15 percent. To the uninitiated, exploring for oil in the highly urbanized <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> region may be akin to searching for water in a desert. But specialists say about one in five exploratory wells in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Basis are successful, or about twice the industry's standard ratio. Still, `` you will never find a giant -LRB- oil field -RRB- in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Poutchkovsky </PERSON>, nothing the basin has proven reserves of only about 280 million barrels. By contrast, the biggest oil basin in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, has 8 billion barrels of known reserves _ and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has 167 billion barrels. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> knew it had oil centuries ago when miners in <LOCATION> Alsace </LOCATION> caught drippings in buckets. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>'s first well was discovered in 1958, but it was not until the Chaunoy find by <ORGANIZATION> Esso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SAF </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, that the industry took serious notice. About 15 companies were operating in the region at the time of the Chaunoy discovery. Today there are as many as 90, many of them foreign. <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, has been established in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> since 1980. The first foreign company to operate in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, it now ranks No. 4 overall with a production rate of 10,000 barrels a day, said <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousset </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION>'s director of exploration. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had a record year in 1987, producing 22.4 million barrels of oil. But that was dwarfed by the 464.7 million barrels it imported. Industry executives say costs of extracting the crude are higher than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and benefits remain marginal. `` Exploration is a long affair. To recover investments is a long process and we are now beginning to recover ours,'' said <PERSON> Mousset </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Triton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mousset </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION>, which is associated with Total in 80 percent of its operations, was disappointed not to have a slice of the exploration permit for the area around the capital. `` They have as much chance of finding oil there as anywhere else,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The dollar closed higher against all the major currencies except the British pound in European trading Monday. Gold prices were mixed. The pound rose after British commercial banks raised their base lending rate by half a percentage point to 11 percent, the second increase in less than a month. Traders said the dollar gained after the news late last Friday of a higher-than-expected rise in the number of Americans at work. That would pump more money into the American economy and started speculation that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates will be raised soon to control inflation. The West German central bank and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> made concerted sales of dollars Monday to stem the dollar's rise and pulled the dollar back from its highest levels of the day, dealers said. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.7022 late Monday, more expensive for buyers than Friday's late $ 1.6977. Other late rates Monday, compared with Friday's late rates, included: 1.9000 West German marks, up from 1.8890; 1.5857 Swiss francs, up from 1.5757; 6.3950 French francs, up from 6.3675; 2.1435 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1315; 1,399.50 Italian lire, up from 1,393.00; 1.2097 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2050. Earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> the dollar exchanged at 133.97 Japanese yen at the close, up from 133.12 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> later the dollar traded at 133.60 yen. Gold bullion prices were higher in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the major market, and lower in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>. Swiss traders said trading was dull and low in volume. Gold closed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid $ 432.25 a troy ounce, up from $ 432.10 late Friday, and in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> at $ 432 bid, down from $ 433. Gold in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> closed at $ 434 bid, up from Saturday's $ 433.99. Silver bullion traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid $ 6.78 a troy ounce, down from $ 6.89.

<HEAD>Bondholders File Suit Against American Brands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of 19 institutional investors filed suit Monday charging that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> violated securities laws by misstating facts when it offered to buy $ 1.5 billion in debt as part of its acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The complaint, filed against both companies in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, seeks $ 350 million in damages. Holders of <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION>'s long-term debt passed up an opportunity to sell out in late February. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> offered to buy two issues of debt at 103 percent and 104 percent of face value plus accrued interest, but the offer expired without the company receiving anywhere near the 51 percent response needed to trigger the purchases. The bonds currently are trading below the price offered by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>. The bondholders, led by <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Forstmann-Leff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, claim they based their decision not to sell on <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>' assertion that it would retain <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> as a wholly owned subsidiary. The plaintiffs, who hold about $ 600 million of <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1.5 billion in outstanding debt, had expected <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> to sell only a `` few segments of <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION>'s businesses that did not fit into the core business strategy.'' Four months later, however, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> announced it would sell most of <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> _ including its debt _ to <ORGANIZATION> Riklis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> paid <PERSON> Riklis </PERSON> to retain five E-II businesses <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding debt is now the obligation of <PERSON> Riklis </PERSON>. In their lawsuit, the bondholders allege <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> `` pursued a secret strategy completely inconsistent with the statements made in the tender offer document'' when it was acquiring <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> shares in February for $ 17.05 a share, or about $ 2.7 billion including debt. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Conforti </PERSON> said the company had been advised that `` the suits are without merit.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> `` made it clear at the outset that we would not assume the indebtedness.'' American Brands disclaimed any legal responsibility for the bonds before the merger with <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> was completed, saying the debt would remain <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION>'s responsibility once it became a subsidiary. The suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages. The two bond issues in question come due in March 1997 and March 1999. Interest payments on the debt total about $ 194 million, according to published estimates.

 Corn, oat and soybean futures plunged their permitted daily limits on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> Monday in reaction to unexpectedly heavy showers sweeping slowly across the Corn Belt. Wheat futures also closed lower. A storm system that brought up to an inch of rain to much of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> on Sunday was expected to pour water Monday night and Tuesday on drought-stressed crops in the central Midwest. `` There's rain around and there's more rain coming,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` That's what broke the back of the bulls today.'' Cooler temperatures were expected in the storm system's wake. The crops were badly in need of both moisture and cooler conditions, especially the soybean crop, which is in the middle of its most vulnerable growth phase. <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> called the sell-off `` very gradual, very orderly.'' Prices opened sharply below Friday's closing levels, then gradually fell their limits _ 10 cents a bushel for corn and oats, and 30 cents a bushel for all soybean contracts except the August contract, on which limits has been removed pending its expiration on Aug. 22. At the close, wheat was 2 \ cents to 5 cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.76 a bushel; corn was 6 -LCB- cents to 10 cents lower with September at $ 2.96 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 8 -LCB- cents to 10 cents lower with September at $ 2.73 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 15 cents to 34 -LCB- cents lower with August at $ 8.42 a bushel

 The stock market lost ground today, still mired in uncertainty about the outlook for inflation and interest rates. Analysts said traders remained concerned about a possible increase in inflationary pressures and rising interest rates.

 The dollar finished higher against most major currencies Monday despite concerted central bank intervention to stem its rise. Gold prices were mixed. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 430.20 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 432 an ounce late Friday. The dollar gained ground at home and in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as traders continued to react favorably to last week's better-than-expected employment report for July and revised data for June. `` The dollar continues to advance on the strength or perceived strength of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McGroarty </PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` People are feeling optimistic that the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- might move further in terms of raising interest rates'' to hold down inflation, he said. Higher interest rates make dollar-denominated investments more attractive. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> intervened sporadically throughout the session to keep the dollar from rising too sharply against the West German mark. But while the action slowed the dollar's rise, `` it's not stopping it,'' noted <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sapiro </PERSON>, chief dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The dollar pierced through 1.90 marks, a level not seen since January 1987, forcing traders have had to revamp their outlook for the dollar. Some now speculate that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency could top 1.95 marks in the near-term. `` It seems the authorities are trying to send signals that they are sincere in keeping the dollar from moving much higher, but the market is choosing to ignore them,'' <PERSON> McGroarty </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar traded 133.97 Japanese yen at the close, up from 133.12 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar traded at 133.60 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 133.73 yen, down from 133.88 yen on Friday. The dollar fell against the pound after British commercial banks raised their base lending rate by half a percentage point to 11 percent, the second increase in less than a month. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound rose to $ 1.7022 late Monday, from Friday's late $ 1.6977. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it cost $ 1.7005 to buy one pound, more expensive than $ 1.6878 on Friday. But the dollar moved higher against most other currencies. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Friday, included: 1.9001 West German marks, up from 1.8948; 1.5883 Swiss francs, up from 1.5826; 6.4115 French francs, up from 6.3865; 1,402.00 Italian lire, up from 1,396.50, and 1.2110 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2069. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Friday, included: 1.9000 West German marks, up from 1.8890; 1.5857 Swiss francs, up from 1.5757; 6.3950 French francs, up from 6.3675; 2.1435 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1315; 1,399.50 Italian lire, up from 1,393.00; and 1.2097 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2050. Gold rose in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to close at $ 434 a troy ounce from Saturday's $ 433.99. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid of $ 432.25 a troy ounce, up from $ 432.10 late Friday. But it fell in light trading in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> to $ 432 an ounce from $ 433 Friday. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for August delivery fell to $ 430.40 a troy ounce from $ 432.30 late Friday. Silver bullion traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid $ 6.78 a troy ounce, down from $ 6.89. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for August delivery slipped to $ 6.675 an ounce, from $ 6.855 late Friday.

 Labor Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> announced a $ 14.8 million plan Monday to meet the emergency survival needs of thousands of migrant and seasonal farm workers left without money or jobs because of the drought. But Rep. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s package is not enough to help migrant workers stranded across the drought-parched <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> without a job or enough money to finance the return trip home `` When you're looking at the amount of money big farmers, agri-conglomerates are getting, they really are not providing for the bottom-rung people who do the harvesting and stoop labor,'' <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said. `` They should have been more fair in trying to bring relief to these people,'' said <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, himself a former migrant worker. <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said he had sought $ 20 million to $ 25 million, which would have come closer to `` meeting short-term survival needs.'' A $ 3.9 billion package of drought assistance for farmers, ranchers and dairy producers passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Monday and could receive final legislative approval as early as Tuesday in the House. <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said he was working with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> to free up more money for the migrant workers Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> promised the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would marshal funds quickly. She said she also was writing to state governors and agencies to recommend `` special employment services and unemployment insurance consideration for migrant farm workers.'' `` The severe drought in some parts of the nation has had a devastating effect on migrant farm workers and their families,'' Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Some are stranded without work or money to return home, while others face extreme hardship at their home base.'' Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said she has authorized existing migrant worker programs operating under <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> grants to use up to 15 percent of their current funding for emergency services such as health care, transportation and temporary shelter. The agency said that could mean up to $ 9.5 million may be spent. She said another $ 5 million has been set aside from a Job Partnership Training Act reserve account for displaced workers to be used specifically for migrant farm workers hurt by the drought. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also said portions of some states may be declared disaster areas, triggering a disaster unemployment insurance program. Twenty-two states have asked the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> to be designated drought-disaster areas. These states have an estimated 200,000 migrant and seasonal farm workers, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. They are <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>.

 The stock market posted its third straight loss Monday, still mired in uncertainty about the outlook for inflation and interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 14.94 points last Thursday and Friday, fell another 11.73 to 2,107.40. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 585 up, 781 down and 578 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 148.80 million shares, up from 113.40 million in the previous session.

 <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will sell its oil and gas holdings in the <LOCATION> Williston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Conoco </ORGANIZATION> for an undisclosed sum, company officials announced Monday.

Since 1985, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> has sold gas plants at <LOCATION> Williston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tioga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Conoco </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, will obtain <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' interest in about 175 oil and gas wells that produce about 4,000 barrels of oil and 2.8 million cubic feet of natural gas a day Also included in the sale are 234,000 undeveloped acres in eastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' interest in the <LOCATION> Williston </LOCATION> property amounted to about 2,000 barrels of oil and 1 million cubic feet of gas a day. He said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production last year was 113,000 barrels of oil and 772 million cubic feet of natural gas a day. Industry analysts say the amount of domestic oil and gas reserves up for sale has about doubled in the past year because of the market created by high exploration costs. The transactions usually reflect the seller's need to reduce debt and the buyer's desire for proven production at a cost lower than that of exploring for new reserves, the analysts said.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Plunge On Rain Prospects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Corn, oat and soybean futures plunged their permitted daily limits Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> following unexpectedly heavy showers on the Corn Belt's northwestern edge and forecasts for rain in the central <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mixed; energy futures advanced; precious metals fell; and stock-index futures retreated. Wheat futures also closed lower in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. But with rain in the forecasts, the selling pressure in the grain pits was focused on corn and soybeans _ the crops that still stand to gain or lose, depending on the weather. A storm system that brought up to an inch of rain to much of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> on Sunday was expected to pour water on drought-stressed crops in the central <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> on Monday night and Tuesday. `` There's rain around and there's more rain coming,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` That's what broke the back of the bulls today. Cooler temperatures were expected in the storm system's wake. The crops were badly in need of both moisture and cooler conditions, especially the soybean crop, which is in the middle of its most vulnerable growth phase, analysts said. <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said the sell-off was `` very gradual, very orderly.'' Prices opened sharply below Friday's closing levels, then gradually fell their limits _ 10 cents a bushel for corn and oats, and 30 cents a bushel for all soybean contracts except the August contract, on which limits has been removed pending its expiration on Aug. 22. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued a 6-to-10-day outlook predicting above-normal temperatures and normal rainfall in most of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> during the first five days of next week. In addition to watching the weather, grain traders are eagerly awaiting Thursday's crop report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The report will contain the government's first grain and soybean production estimates based on field surveys and is expected to show a deterioration of crop conditions during July. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s last crop report was believed to have reflected most of the drought damage done to the corn crop, with a predicted production of 5.2 billion bushels, about 30 percent less than last year. But intense speculation surrounds the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s soybean production figure, which is expected to come out sharply lower than 1.65 billion bushels, the last official estimate. Soybean production estimates released by private grain analysts over the last few days have ranged from 1.4 billion to 1.54 billion bushels. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grain specialist in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report `` will put to rest, to a certain extent, the magnitude of ranges as far as crop damage estimates are concerned.'' Wheat settled 2 \ cents to 6 cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.76 \ a bushel; corn was 3 -LCB- cents to 10 cents lower with September at $ 2.96 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 10 cents lower across the board with September at $ 2.73 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 13 -LCB- cents to 36 -LCB- cents lower with August at $ 8.40 a Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in response to lower feed grain prices and stronger cash markets, analysts said. Live cattle were .58 cent lower to .10 cent higher with August at 68.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .55 cent lower to .17 cent higher with August at 79.37 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .97 cents lower with August at 45.82 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .87 cent lower to .53 cent higher with August at 32.95 cents a pound. Energy futures on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> leaped higher in late trading and closed on the day's highs in reaction to news that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had agreed to a cease-fire date of Aug. 20, said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 56 cents to 61 cents higher with September at $ 15.87 a barrel; heating oil was 1.34 cents to 1.48 cents higher with September at 44.50 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.39 cents to 1.44 cents higher with September at 46.65 cents a gallon Precious metals moved lower in mostly technically inspired trading on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled $ 1.80 to $ 1.90 lower with August at $ 430.40 a pound; silver was 17.2 cents to 17.5 cents lower with September at $ 6.715 a troy ounce Stock-index futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 2.40 points lower at 269.80.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> will be allowed to merge their business and production operations because the smaller <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> was in danger of financial failure stemming from years of steady and apparently irreversible losses, Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Monday. In approving the application for a joint operating agreement, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> rejected the recommendation of a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> administrative law judge who said the two newspapers' pricing policies were unrealistic. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, however, said there was little prospect for the Free Press to return to profitability in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s highly competitive market. `` For me, the continuing and persistent operating losses suffered by the Free Press over the course of nearly a decade, with no prospect of unilaterally reversing that economic condition in the foreseeable future, describes a newspaper ` in danger of financial failure','' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said in his opinion. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told reporters that the Free Press' losses were not manipulated but came `` from intense competition.'' The <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> joint operating agreement was the fifth approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> under the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970, which allows limited antitrust exemption to preserve independent editorial voices in a community where one newspaper is in danger of failing. Previous partial mergers were approved for newspapers in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, in 1974, <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> in 1979, <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, in 1980 and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> in 1982. The Free Press, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and the News, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, had asked permission in May 1986 to merge their advertising, circulation and production operations under a law designed to preserve newspaper competition The newspapers, which rank among the nation's 10 largest, said the Free Press was in danger of going out of business without the joint operating agreement. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>'s directors had voted to shut down the Free Press if the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had rejected the application for a joint operating agreement. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> said in January that the Free Press' operating losses had totaled $ 100 million since 1979, and that the News had lost about $ 75 million in the same period. The Free Press lost $ 18 million on revenues of $ 172 million in 1987. `` This decision reaffirms the will of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that two independent editorial voices should be preserved wherever possible in the cities of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Alvah </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Free Press Publisher <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said: `` This is the best single day of my years at the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. It leads the way to the next century of service for the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, which already has been part of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> for more than a century and a half.'' <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON> and president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> also expressed gratification. `` We said all along that the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> was the only way to preserve two independent news and editorial voices,'' they said in a statement issued from <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in suburban <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` The attorney general's decision is in the best interest of the community, the readers, the advertisers and the employees.'' Said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedheim </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>: `` While the administrative law judge in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> case misapplied the statute in some important ways, we are pleased that the attorney general appears to have taken a view more consistent with the intent of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> administrative law judge, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Needelman </PERSON>, recommended in December 1987 that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> deny the request on grounds that the newspapers' losses were due to unrealistic circulation and advertising discounts aimed at forcing each other out of business. The newspapers denied <PERSON> Needelman </PERSON>'s assertion, saying he lacked an understanding of the newspaper business. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, one of several suburban <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> papers that had criticized the joint operating agreement request, said he was `` quite surprised'' that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had ignore the advice of the judge who had heard all the evidence in the case `` and made a very studious decision.'' While <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was still considering the case, Free Press Editor <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON> rejected three cartoons about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> by staff cartoonist <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>. Another Knight-Ridder paper, the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, also decided not to publish editorial cartoons about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> while the case was pending. Newspaper employee unions and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> initially opposed the partial merger, but most dropped their opposition after <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> directors voted to shut down the Free Press if they failed to win approval of a joint operating agreement. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said the owner's threat to close the Free Press was noted in the record of the case, but was not the deciding factor in his decision. The <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, the last employee union to oppose the joint operating agreement, dropped its opposition July 25. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> and most of the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> congressional delegation supported the agreement. The Free Press had circulation in March of 647,763 daily and 721,676 on Sundays, the 10th largest circulation in the nation, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circulation </ORGANIZATION>. The circulation of the News was 688,211 daily and 836,331 on Sundays, the eighth largest nationally, the bureau said. The Free Press was founded in 1831 and purchased by a predecessor of <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> in 1940. The News was founded in 1873 and purchased by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> in 1986.

 The nation's biggest airline company, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, reported Monday that its second-quarter net loss widened sharply, while <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its profit after taxes nearly doubled. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said its net loss widened to $ 255.9 million from a loss of $ 27 million in the second quarter of 1987. The company blamed a significant part of the loss on government investigations of alleged safety problems at its two main subsidiaries, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s second-quarter revenue slipped 1.4 percent, to $ 2.13 billion from $ 2.16 billion a year earlier. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> launched investigations of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> in mid-April that were unprecedented in their scope. The probes, which continued for most of the second quarter, concluded that both airlines were being run safely. However, a federal report concluded that labor turmoil at Miami-based Eastern must be defused before it creates risks to passengers. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the investigations cost <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> a total of more than $ 60 million in lost revenue and $ 14 million in expenses such as overtime, advertising and legal and accounting fees. `` Both airlines have implemented various marketing and service programs to counter the effects of these investigations on consumer confidence, but the companies have continued to experience some revenue losses beyond the second quarter due to them,'' <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said in a press statement. At <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, the second-quarter net loss was $ 89.8 million, compared with net income of $ 27.1 million a year earlier. Eastern's revenue in the most recent quarter declined to $ 1 billion from $ 1.2 billion <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> posted a $ 19.9 million loss before a $ 131 million adjustment associated with a re-estimation of its air traffic liability. The adjustment had been announced earlier and had no impact on <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s cash position, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said. Including the adjustment, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 150.9 million on revenue of $ 1.1 billion in the second quarter. In the same period a year earlier, the airline lost $ 71.1 million on revenue of $ 1 billion. The results in the latest quarter brought <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s net loss for the first half of the year to $ 380.1 million, widened from a loss of $ 127.7 million in the first six months of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s first-half revenue rose 1.4 percent, to $ 4.26 billion from $ 4.20 billion. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> said its net profit almost doubled in the second quarter from a year earlier, largely due to a cash payment it received from a lawsuit against its former owner, the late <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. The nation's seventh-largest airline said its net income jumped to $ 97.2 million, or $ 2.70 a share, from $ 52.8 million, or $ 1.28 a share, in the second quarter of 1987. In addition to a $ 49.9 million gain from the Hughes lawsuit, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings also benefitted in the quarter from cost controls, a rebound in international passenger traffic which had been hurt by fears of terrorism, and the long-term advantages of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s merger with <ORGANIZATION> Ozark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s second-quarter revenue rose 8.6 percent, to $ 1.14 billion from $ 1.05 billion a year earlier. Profit in the latest quarter includes the $ 49.9 million gain from a cash judgment awarded to <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 in its long-standing lawsuit against <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> management's suit, originally filed in 1962, alleged that the eccentric multimillionaire failed to provide the carrier with adequate aircraft. Although a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court decided in <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s favor last year, the payment was not made until the second quarter. In the first half of the year, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 44.7 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $ 2 million in the first six months of 1987. First-half revenue increased 9.6 percent, to $ 2.06 billion from $ 1.88 billion.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Close Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices were mixed Monday, with long-term issues rising and shorter maturities slipping. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year issue rose 7-32 point, or about $ 2.20 per $ 1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, slipped to 9.10 percent from 9.12 percent late Friday. Short-term governments, meanwhile, fell about 1-16 point. Intermediate maturities were unchanged to 1-16 point higher and 20-year bonds fell 5-16 point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, a money market economist with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the long bond rose on the strength of the dollar and a drop in commodities prices, which lessen the possibility of inflation. `` Long bond people are basically thinking that inflation should be under control,'' <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said. Credit markets are concerned that increased inflation would erode the value of fixed-income securities such as bonds. Traders also bought long bonds on optimism about Tuesday's planned <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> auction, in which three-year notes will be auctioned, <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said On Wednesday, 10-year notes will be auctioned in the second day of the government's quarterly refunding sale. The $ 22 billion sale will not include 30-year issues because the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> has practically exhausted its authority to issue them without congressional action. <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said the price of shorter-term issues fell because traders expect the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to tighten credit. He said the market expected the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to allow the federal funds rate, the interest charges for overnight loans between banks, to rise. The fed funds rate traded at 7 11-16 percent late Monday, unchanged from late Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.51 to 1,138.19. Corporate bonds also rose. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, advanced 0.38 to 284.09. In the tax-exempt market, general obligation and revenue bonds rose 1-32 point from Friday, with the average yield unchanged at 8.02 percent, according to the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose to 7.04 percent as the discount rate fell 5 basis points to 6.84 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 7.60 percent as the discount rate rose 1 basis point to 7.24 percent. Yields on one-year bills were unchanged at 8.00 percent as the discount rate was also unchanged at 7.46 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. In an auction Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 6.8 billion in new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.94 percent, up from 6.89 percent last week. Another $ 6.8 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.26 percent, up from 7.15 percent last week. The rates were the highest since Oct. 13, when three-month bills sold for 6.96 percent and six-month bills averaged 7.34 percent.

 <ORGANIZATION> Hershey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, deciding to jettison its nine-year venture into the restaurant industry, said Monday it is selling its <ORGANIZATION> Friendly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restaurant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 375 million. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hershey </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said the company felt it could better use its resources concentrating on its primary business _ consumer food products. `` Although Friendly has been a significant part of <ORGANIZATION> Hershey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, our decision to sell Friendly is based upon our continuing review of our strategic plan and evaluation of our business portfolio,'' <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said declining income and other difficult conditions in the restaurant industry figured in <ORGANIZATION> Hershey </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. Income from the restaurant chain fell to $ 45.6 million in 1986 from $ 50.4 million in 1986. In its 1986 annual report, <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> noted heightened competition, lack of real sales growth, a decrease in customers and difficulty finding workers. Two-thirds of the company's sales gain in the restaurant division from 1985 to 1986 came from new and acquired restaurants rather than from higher volume at existing restaurants. Besides its chocolate and confectionery products, <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> also produces several brands of pasta, including <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Giorgio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and American Beauty. Friendly, based in <LOCATION> Wilbraham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, owns and operates a chain of about 850 restaurants, which feature moderately priced menu items and ice cream specialities. Friendly's 1987 sales were $ 572 million. <ORGANIZATION> Hershey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> said the transaction, which will give it an after-tax gain, should be completed within three months, subject to government approval. <ORGANIZATION> TRC </ORGANIZATION>, a private restaurant holding company based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, owns about 51 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Perkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restaurants </ORGANIZATION>, a publicly traded limited partnership, and 100 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Perkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc.. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> owns and franchices more than 330 restaurants, primarily in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and `` We are pleased to enter phase two of <ORGANIZATION> TRC </ORGANIZATION>'s development with a company boasting the high-quality reputation of Friendly,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> TRC </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer. He said Friendly has strong name recognition andd excellent market penetration in the Northeast. Friendly will provide a solid foundation for future growth, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> and Friendly will be operated as separate companies, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON>'s move comes shortly after it announced plans to purchase the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> confectionery operations of <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury-Schweppess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> for $ 270 million plus the assumption of $ 30 million in debt. The purchase, still in progress, will give <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> a wide array of candy lines, stretching from its own well-known products, including Reeses peanut butter candies, to <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION>'s Peter-Paul and York products and <PERSON> Luden </PERSON>'s 5th Avenue bar and cough drops. `` What we're finding is our area of strength is manufacturing, with a primary focus on snacks and confectionery products,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. `` We do think that puts us in a leadership position of the total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> confectionery market,'' he added.

<HEAD>Interco Rejects $70 A Share Offer From City Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday rejected as inadequate a sweetened $ 2.68 billion buyout offer from a Washington-based investor group, and took moves to strengthen its defenses against an unwanted takeover. The manufacturer and retailer of apparel and furniture stated that in addition to rejecting the $ 70 a share merger proposal offered earlier Monday by <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, its board of directors approved a plan to sell the company's apparel division, which accounts for nearly a fourth of its sales. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> board concluded that the interests of the company's shareholders were better served by the company's continued pursuit of the restructuring of the company, which is presently under consideration,'' the company said <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> stock, which rose by more than $ 13 a share when the group's initial offer of $ 64 a share was announced July 28, rose $ 4.12 -LCB- to $ 72.50 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> board also amended its `` poison pill'' defense against hostile takeover, so that it takes effect if a suitor acquires 15 percent or more of <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s 38.4 million outstanding common shares. The company said the change was aimed at preventing an open-market stock accumulation program following the announcement of a proposal to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> or a `` street sweep'' that could accompany or follow a tender offer for the company, in which all <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would not participate equally and at a fair price. <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> owns 8.7 percent, or 3.14 million, of <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding common shares When it made its initial $ 64 a share offer, valued at about $ 2.46 billion, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> said it might increase its bid based on further review of information about <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>. The company had sales of $ 3.34 billion last year, with the apparel group contributing about 24 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> manufactures men's and women's apparel, footwear, furniture and home furnishings. Some of its brand names are among the best known in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Fog clothing, <ORGANIZATION> Florsheim </ORGANIZATION> and Converse shoes, and <PERSON> Broyhill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> furniture.

 Newspaper employees and executives by turns praised and criticized Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s approval Monday of a partial merger of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> with the Detroit News. Champagne flowed in the newsroom at the Free Press, where the decision brought relief after months of uncertainty over whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> would approve the joint operating agreement between the newspaper, the nation's 10th-largest, and the rival News. `` It was like a rush. Waiting for the decision is like living on death row,'' said senior managing editor <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Shine </PERSON>, who had been assigned to write the newspaper's obituary if the joint operating agreement with the News was denied. But critics labeled the deal a blow to competition in the newspaper business. `` This is a travesty of the Newspaper Preservation Act,'' said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Mleczko </PERSON>, a News reporter who is president of <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 22. `` The two largest media companies in the world can take two newspapers that are in a dead heat and get a monopoly.'' <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> had said it would close the 157-year-old Free Press if the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> with the News, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was denied In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, top <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> executives praised <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> employees for persevering under difficult conditions and praised <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> for approving the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is good news for the loyal readers and advertisers of the Free Press, for our hard-working and dedicated employees in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and for our shareholders who have shared the burden of enormous operating losses in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> since 1979,'' <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Alvah </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON> and president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> also praised the decision. `` We said all along that the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> was the only way to preserve two independent news and editorial voices,'' they said in a statement issued from <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` The attorney general's decision is in the best interest of the community, the readers, the advertisers and the employees.'' Newspaper Guild Local 22, the last of the newspapers' unions to drop its opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>, nevertheless was critical of the decision. The Guild, which has 1,100 members in the two newsrooms, held out for better economic terms before agreeing to withdraw its opposition. `` The losers in this are going to be the readers and advertisers in southeastern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and it could set a precedent where you'll see the elimination of competitive journalism in cities throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Mleczko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapids </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, the state's third-largest paper, said he was pleased as a journalist that the merger was approved `` The loss of any daily newspaper would be considered a bad day in journalism by even those of us who think of the Free Press as serious competition,'' said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>, publisher of the <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> -RRB- Press, said he was surprised <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> would disregard the recommendation of the administrative law judge who presided over hearings on the proposed <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>. `` Judge -LRB- <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Needelman </PERSON> sat and listened to these things and made a very studious decision on it, and it's hard to believe the attorney general would so easily overturn what his own administrative law judge recommended,'' <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> said. Reactions from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> politicians also varied. State Senator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, who unsuccessfully sought a new law blocking the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>, said `` What has really happened is the annihilation of the Free Press. It will be ` Gannettized' and the quality staff will be reduced because there will be no incentive without any real competition.'' But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> critic, complemented the attorney general. `` Today's announcement shows what a united community can do and what a united <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> congressional delegation can do. Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s response to that united community is very gratifying indeed,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge ruled Monday that the tiny <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island Republic of <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> must pay an international consortium of banks more than $ 44 million on defaulted loans. The republic, a 200-island archipelago in the south central <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> about 600 miles east of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, borrowed more than $ 30 million to build an electric power generating station in the early 1980s. The nation, once a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trust territory, in March defaulted on the loans and the consortium that had guaranteed the loans had to pay them off. The banks sued the country _ population 14,200 _ for repayment. Under the decision, the banks _ <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scotland </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> _ are entitled to collect some $ 44.3 million in unpaid loans, capitalized interest, insurance premiums, fees and expenses In his 57-page opinion, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweet </PERSON> said the case presented `` an involved factual matrix and complicated issues of sovereignty and commercial law arising out of the struggle of the unsophisticated island people of <LOCATION> Palau </LOCATION> to achieve independence, both economic and political.'' But the judge concluded the banks were entitled to collect the amounts they had guaranteed. Sweet's ruling was the latest round in a three-year legal battle between the banks, some of the largest in the world, and <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>, whose main industry is fishing. `` This decision is but one step along what may turn out to be a long road, but at least this phase has been completed,'' said Sweet. After a week-long trial in April and final arguments in June, Sweet ruled that <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> willingly waived its right to sovereign immunity, and thus protection from lawsuits, when it signed the loan agreements. Sweet also ruled that <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> failed to prove its contention that the banks had misrepresented how the power plant would pay for itself or that <LOCATION> Palauan </LOCATION> officials signed documents they did not understand.
