<HEAD>15 Vincennes Sailors Disciplined for Drug Use</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday that 15 crew members of the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION>, the cruiser that shot down an Iranian jetliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last summer, will be disciplined for drug abuse. `` There is no connection now to the July 3 incident in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to what has happened on board the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surface </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, meanwhile, will be shifted to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shipyard </LOCATION> within five weeks for modifications to correct deficiencies in the Aegis electronic combat control system, The -LRB- <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. Aegis, which would enable a ship like the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> to make computer-recommended battle decisions for entire fleets, was found flawed in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> confrontation. According to Pentagon analysts, split-second decisions were affected by the inability of radar-scope interpreters to immediately match the plane's `` blip'' with digital direction, altitude and speed information displayed on another screen. Those problems are one reason the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> will undergo modernization, an unidentified source told The <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. None of the sailors involved in the drug sweep were in positions that may have influenced the decision by Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to fire two anti-aircraft missiles at the jetliner, <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> said. All 290 aboard the plane died. Of the 15 sailors, six are being processed for discharge from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, while six others have been given warnings, <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> said. `` Three are petty officers who are being investigated for possible court-martial in connection with drug sales,'' he said. <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> noted that the 15 sailors represent 3.9 percent of the 384 sailors on board. `` That is less than the 5.4 percent average for the entire <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. The announcement came as preparations were under way at the <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> for Saturday's change of command aboard the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> will be rotated to a new assignment at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> The new <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> commander is Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, who had been stationed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and is assuming his fifth sea command. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, have been under guard by the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> since a pipe bomb exploded under the family van Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was driving to her teaching job March 10 in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>. She escaped injury. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the attack as possible terrorist retaliation for the airliner's destruction.

 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> plans to announce his resignation from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday, Democratic sources said Friday, throwing the party's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership into even more turmoil with the expected resignation next week of Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, his career in shambles as a result of ethics charges, disappeared for a long holiday weekend _ after first handing out roses from his garden to television reporters camped outside his door. Hours later, sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity said <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the Californian who was third-ranking Democrat in the party's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership, also plans to quit because some of his business dealings are under scrutiny. Popular Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is likely to be elevated to speaker without a hint of discord, but <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> had expected to be a contender for <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s current job in what was expected to be a nasty battle. But <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> he plans to resign his leadership position as soon as a successor is picked and will quit the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on June 15, his 47th birthday. `` I do n't intend to put this institution through more turmoil. And more importantly, I do n't intend to put my family through more turmoil,'' the Times quoted him as saying. `` If I ca n't be leader and if I ca n't be whip, it's time to try a new and different challenge. Therefore, June 15, which is my 47th birthday, will be my last day in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> told the Times. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s decision will be announced Saturday at the Capitol, said one source, who explained. `` he does n't want his attention or abilities distracted in this fashion.'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> `` has been told by his attorneys that he has no legal difficulties. But he just thinks enough is enough,'' the source said. `` He does not want to put his party through it.'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> was facing questions about a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> bank executive's purchase of a high-yield junk bond for <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> in 1986, when <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> found himself unable to finance the transaction The bond was sold to <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> by the executive a month later at the initial offering price, saving <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> about $ 4,000 compared to the bond's market price at the time. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported this week that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was opening a criminal investigation of whether <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> received favored treatment from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said the story was wrong. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> was expected to face other contenders for the majority leader's spot, including <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Likely candidates for the whip position, the post now held by <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, include <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, Chief Deputy Whip <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and perhaps <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> _ though <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> let it be known he wo n't try for the No. 2 majority leader's position against <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, who helped in his unsuccessful presidential campaign. Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Democrat who made an impression as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, might also jump into the majority leader's race. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> said he has been urged by colleagues to run but has made no decision. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> faced a difficult fight to move up to the no. 2 spot as Democrats were leery of perpetuating the image problems they have had to deal with as <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has fought ethics committee charges of financial impropriety. One lawmaker, a <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> ally, said, `` there are a good many of us'' trying to persuade <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> to step aside, thus freeing <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> to run. Common Cause, the private group that joined in the complaint that brought the ethics commission investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, said Friday it was asking the panel to open a formal inquiry of <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>. A source close to <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Democrat `` will be a candidate for the position when the speaker resigns.'' And <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> apparently will have support from the powerful chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowsk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The sources, aware of the sensitive nature of the situation with <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> still in his job, commented only on condition they not be named. While the succession struggle swirled about him, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> went on a weekend getaway with his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, to an undisclosed location, his aides said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> awoke Friday morning to find television crews encamped in his front yard. He came outside, cut a bouquet of roses from his garden, and handed them to a network news producer, but declined to answer questions. `` I'll have a statement to make at some time, and when I do, I'll welcome you,'' he said. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyers and representatives of the ethics panel talked over a possible arrangement under which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would give up his position _ which makes him the nation's highest elected Democrat _ in exchange for the dropping of at least one of the major charges against him. In particular, he is said to be interested in wiping out an allegation that his wife <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> was given a no-work job by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s friend and business partner, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> House rules prohibit gifts from people with a diret interest in legislation, a description the committee says applies to <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, meanwhile, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> that `` there is no vacancy'' for the speaker's job and `` I have no knowledge on his part of plans to resign.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had not asked him to schedule time for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to address the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to defend himself against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee charges he committed 69 rules violations.

<HEAD>Police: 6th Graders Steal $10,100 In Bank Field Trip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JAY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two sixth-graders have been charged with helping themselves to more than $ 10,000 in cash during a class tour of a bank vault. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Elementary </PERSON> <PERSON> School </PERSON> <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowling </PERSON> said he dropped about 30 students off at <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> Thursday morning and returned to pick them up about an hour later. Hours later, the bank manager called to report $ 10,100 was missing. <PERSON> Nowling </PERSON> said he called <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON>, a resource officer at <ORGANIZATION> Jay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, to ask students about the reported theft. <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON> and another deputy questioned the students who went on the field trip one at a time. <PERSON> Nowling </PERSON> said the boys did n't try to hide the theft but apparently did n't say why they helped themselves to the cash. The two allegedly stuffed their clothes with $ 100 bills. Deputies recovered all of the missing money. Sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said the boys were picked up by the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. They were charged with grand theft and taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nowling </PERSON> said the two, who had recently transferred to his school, are n't representative of its students. `` Our kids are good kids, basically. We normally do n't have problems,'' he said. Later, <PERSON> Nowling </PERSON> gathered all the sixth-graders for a lecture on `` finance.'' `` I think -LRB- the incident -RRB- may have seemed kind of funny to start out with, but when I got there it ceased being funny,'' he said. The principal said he had not had a chance to apologize to the bank manager, `` but I do n't think this will affect our ability to tour the bank as in years past.'' <PERSON> Nowling </PERSON> said the boys have been suspended from school for the remainder of the year. Bank officials refused to discuss the incident Friday.

<HEAD>Time-Warner Merger Now Needs Only Shareholder Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Shareholders meetings next month are the last big hurdle to the $ 18 billion merger of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> following action by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> on Friday granted a temporary waiver of its cross-ownership restrictions, which was the final regulatory approval needed in the creation of the world's largest entertainment and media conglomerate. The commission had to review the transaction because a <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary _ <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ operates cable television systems in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, areas, which overlap with the viewership of television stations owned by <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a company that controls a 15.5 percent block of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock and would hold about 12 percent of the combined conglomerate. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s waiver gave the companies 18 months to comply with federal cross-ownership rules that generally prohibit one company from owning multiple media outlets in one area. There are at least four ways the companies can comply: <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> could sell the affected cable systems; <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> could sell its TV subsidiary; or it could reduce its stake in the combined <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> to below 5 percent; or <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> could apply and receive a permanent waiver from the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>. `` We perceive no public interest benefit in removing cable service to the many communities involved in this matter until a buyer or buyers can be found,'' the commission wrote in its opinion. `` The alternative would be to hold up a major transaction of which the cable systems constitute but a very small part.'' The chairmen of both companies, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> of Time and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, said in a joint statement: `` We are delighted to have successfully completed the federal review process necessary for our merger. ... We are confident that the nation's policy makers will not be disappointed in the pro-competitive, pro-American and pro-consumer impact of the merger. Seven weeks ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the merger would not violate antitrust laws. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> approved proxy materials for separate Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shareholders meetings scheduled June 23 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A majority of shareholders of record on May 1 must approve the merger, which was announced on March 3. The transaction also must be approved by several local cable franchising authorities. Time owns systems with about 4 million subscribers while <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> has about 1.5 million cable subscribers. The proposed conglomerate, <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, would surpass <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as the world's biggest media and entertainment concern. Time publishes Time, People and Sports Illustrated magazines and owns <ORGANIZATION> Time-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> and the Book-of-the-Month Club. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> operates the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> movie and television studios as well as <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recording </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> owns cable systems or has a stake in cable systems serving Canyon Country, <PERSON> Orange </PERSON>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gardena </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, who as a young lawyer became a target of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> but whose boss' spirited defense of him helped turn the tables on the senator, has died of a heart attack. He was 68. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> died Thursday while attending a lecture sponsored by the Israeli bar in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. He was a senior partner in the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> firm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Dorr </PERSON>, which he joined shortly after his graduation from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. He recently had moved to <LOCATION> Sagamore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> played an inadvertant part in the dramatic 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings that grew out of a dispute between the senator and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials, whom <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> had accused of `` coddling Fifth Amendment communists.'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Republican, accused a number of public officials, military officers and prominent private citizens in the early 1950s of having Communist affiliations.

I fear he shall always bear a scar, needlessly inflicted by you.'' `` Have you no decency, sir?'' he said to <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. The exchange on national television was considered a pivotal point in turning public opinion against the senator, who subsequently was censured by his colleagues. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> later became a partner at the firm in 1958 and organized its commercial law department. He also served as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and as chairman of many committees of the American and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> bar associations.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has been hit by a series of strikes in recent months recalling the pre-Thatcher days of national walkouts that helped bring down a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government. But experts say the scenario is very different from the `` Winter of Discontent'' of 1978-79 when public service workers paralyzed much of the country. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ousted the socialists in May 1979 on a wave of anti-union sentiment Experts predict the strikes will eventually subside after a current round of wage negotiations. Although there are concerns the walkouts could lead to higher wages and prices, their impact will be limited by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s union-curbing laws, they say. Repeated one-day walkouts by subway workers and bus drivers have forced millions of Londoners to walk to work. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has canceled or cut live television and radio programs because of brief strikes by employees for higher pay. Dockworkers are voting on whether to strike at <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 40 ports over the government's plans to abolish a job-guarantee plan. Engineers and university and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> workers are also restive. `` When times were very hard in the 1980s, we took a back seat,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mowat </PERSON>, an official with the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest union. `` We negotiated wage decreases. Now Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is telling us that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s economy is booming so we think ... we should be partial beneficiaries of that boom.'' The strikes have been spurred by high wage demands stemming from resurging inflation and interest rates. Changes in work practices sought by new managers to control costs and raise efficiency are also a factor, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a lecturer at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Gavyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said the economic effect of the renewed industrial strife `` is much less because the economy has moved to be more service-oriented, more small firm-oriented and more female labor, and in each of those areas there is less incidence of union membership.'' <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, an official with the employers' Confederation of British Industry said: `` Our view is that it is a short-lived period of industrial disputes ... There is no widespead fear of an upswing in union militancy.'' Workers are demanding raises as high as 15 percent, pointing to the rising inflation, which largely is blamed on a credit-fueled consumer spending boom. April's 8 percent annual inflation rate was more than double the 3.9 percent rate a year earlier. The government has tried to curb inflation by raising interest rates 10 times in the past year _ from 7.5 percent to 14 percent. But the subsequent higher mortgage rates have boosted pay requests. Employees of the soon-to-be-privatized electricity industry recently won a 9.2 percent pay raise, higher than the inflation rate. The settlement averted a walkout. It has been difficult for companies to reject wage demands as their profits have soared _ they were up 12 percent in 1988 and are expected to be healthy this year. In addition, many employers have difficulty recruiting labor. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s national unemployment rate has nearly halved to 6.5 percent. And lower birth rates of the 1970s are going to translate into fewer workers in the 1990s. `` Unions are in quite a strong bargaining position,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. However, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has curbed union power with laws banning sympathy strikes and mass picketing and forcing secret ballots on whether to strike. Union membership has declined to 8.8 million from a peak of 12.2 million in 1979. Last year, 3.02 million work days were lost to strikes, compared with 30 million in 1979.

 An engine room fire forced an attack submarine to surface off the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast, and the diesel-powered sub was towed to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> on Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said. None of the 73 crew members aboard the USS Blueback were injured in the Thursday afternoon fire, the second accident in two days involving a San Diego-based submarine. Another ship was towing the <LOCATION> Blueback </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, said Lt. <PERSON> Sonya </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedley </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Naval Submarine Base here. Officers initially had hoped the sub could make the trip under its own power. `` They experienced a minor electrical fire in their propulsion system,'' <PERSON> Hedley </PERSON> said. The sub, which carries a crew of 65 enlisted and eight officers, was on general training operations, she said. In the other incident, the attack submarine Gurnard was freed after being stuck on a reef for about four hours. The ship was submerged when it hit the reef, Ms. <PERSON> Hedley </PERSON> said, correcting earlier reports it was on the surface.

 Teachers and students returned to peaceful campuses Friday after settlement of a nearly two-week strike, but the atmosphere was more social than academic, some said. `` People have n't seen each other in two weeks and they want to talk to each other and welcome each other back,'' said 10th Street Elementary School Assistant Principal <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>. Throughout the 700-square-mile district, teachers at nearly 600 schools were greeted with flowers, balloons and hugs from students. But numerous absences indicated the Memorial Day weekend may have tempted many students to stay away. Students who reported to class during the strike were subjected to auditorium assemblies, educational films and lengthy study periods overseen by substitute teachers. Thousands of others stayed away from school. `` I do n't think we knew how much our teachers provided us with motivation to learn,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everything is back to normal now,'' said a smiling <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, a 10th grader at <ORGANIZATION> Belmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have our teachers back and now we can get back to our studies.'' Special education teacher <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ung </PERSON> said the mood among the teachers was upbeat at Belmont High. `` It seems to be getting back to normal. From everyone I've talked to, the mood is good, the attitude is excellent,'' he said. But he noticed that classes seemed thin. `` Some may be taking advantage of the long weekend,'' he said. There were 365,137 students in class in the nation's second largest school district, hardly a dramatic lift from the 305,650 attending Thursday, the last day of the strike that began May 15. Teachers did return nearly in force, with 24,569 regularly assigned teachers out of a possible 26,250 returning Friday, with 1,447 substitutes bringing the number to 26,016, `` pretty close to full strength,'' said school district spokeswoman <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Hain </PERSON>. On Thursday, members of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers-Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> approved by voice vote a $ 600 million, three-year contract giving them a 24 percent raise over three years and a bigger voice in the control of their schools. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>'s seven-member board approved the pact during a closed door meeting the same day, with arguments centering on the $ 120 million in cuts the school board staff says will have to be made elsewhere to provide the teacher salary increases. The contract, 16 months in the making, is retroactive to July. The union represents 22,000 of the district's 32,000 teachers, counselors, nurses and librarians.

<TEXT>
 For nearly 20 years, space buffs have wondered who composed the words `` That's one small step for a man'' which <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said when he stepped on the moon. Now, with the one-score anniversary coming up July 20, <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> says that not only were those words his own, but that he composed them on the spot. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, commander of the Apollo 11 moon mission, was reunited with his two crew mates for a news conference Friday to satisfy requests for interviews in connection with celebrations planned across the world to mark the event. He was asked when exactly he decided on the words `` That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,'' which he said after climbing down the ladder on the lunar lander. `` It was a statement that was natural in the sense of the time,'' <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said. `` I thought about it after we got there.'' With that he destroyed longstanding rumors in space circles that some anonymous public relations genius, not <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, created those words for history. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, along with lunar module pilot <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> `` Buzz'' <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> and command module pilot <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, fielded questions from reporters with humor and self-deprecation for the niche they carved in the annals of exploration. Here are some <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> comments: _ On the use of robots to explore space _ a technique favored by many scientists: `` Man can be amused and amazed, and a robot can be neither. _ On leaving footprints on the moon that will remain undisturbed for millennia: `` I had hoped that somebody goes up there some day and cleans them up. _ On how their lives were changed by their adventure: `` Before 1969, press conferences were much smaller. _ On whether the Apollo moon program was a stunt of little value: `` Even if it was a bad idea, I'm glad we did it. All three were asked what moment of their mission they would choose to relive. <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON>, who just published a book on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s space program, answered it would be the last 10 seconds before they touched down on the lunar surface and the first 10 seconds afterward. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said, `` I would pick a moment when I could look out the window and see a full Earth.'' And <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said it would be the moment when he saw the lunar module returning from the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>'s surface against the background of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> floating in the black of space. In his view, he said, were both the Earth with three billion people and the moon ship with only two.

 They ca n't play rock music, and they have to use a parking lot, instead of a ballfield. But a pro-marijuana group has won a judge's permission to hold a rally over the Memorial Day weekend. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> on Friday ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cannabis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to refrain from selling T-shirts or playing amplified music at the rally Sunday in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Adams </LOCATION>, a small industrial city in the <LOCATION> Berkshires </LOCATION>. A rock concert would not be in keeping with the `` solemnity of Memorial Day, when we acknowledge those who died representing their country,'' the judge said. He also pointed out that `` the Constitution protects expressions of thought, not profit-making activities.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, an attorney for the group, said it was willing to use the parking lot, rather than a ballfield as it had originally hoped. `` It's a disappointment, but we'll have speeches, acoustic music and distribute literature,'' said <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>, one of the organizers, after the hearing in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, the judge told both sides to find a suitable place for the rally. Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who opposes legalization, suggested the city landfill. `` This group has a right to express its feelings whether we agree with them or not,'' <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> said Friday, noting that the coalition's request had been before the city Recreation Commission for four months. <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> said the group initially wanted to march in the city's Memorial Day Parade, but a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans group opposed the idea `` They wanted no part of it,'' he said. `` So we came up the idea of having a gathering in the park.'' Said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>: `` We recognize that reform of the marijuana laws is a very controversial subject. And we were hesitant to inject it into the Memorial Day Parade because of the solemnity of the observance.''

<HEAD>Seabrook Operators Prepare for First Atomic Reaction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Engineer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was part of the team overseeing the startup of a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> reactor that 30 years ago helped usher in the age of commercial nuclear power. Today, he is preparing to lead the start of atomic fission at the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, a symbol for the anti-nuclear movement and bellwether for utility industry officials worldwide who hope to promote a new, safer generation of nuclear reactors. The $ 6 billion Seabrook reactor, which was originally planned for commercial operation in 1979 and completed but idle for three years because of evacuation-planning and financial problems, won a low-power testing license Friday. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted the license a day after a federal appeals court declined to delay the tests. The testing process is expected to start this weekend, leading to the first fission reaction in <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>'s fuel core in seven to 10 days, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the plant, recalled his days as a `` dark-haired young engineer'' conducting environmental monitoring at <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rowe </ORGANIZATION> when the reactor started its atomic tests in 1960. It was the nation's second commercial nuclear power plant. `` It's a different ball game now,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in an interview in his office. In contrast to <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s tumultuous history, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> plant was built in three years for $ 45 million. It produces only 189 megawatts of electricity. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> is supposed to produce six times as much. `` A lot more is at stake with this one,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, arguing that <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> is vital for meeting the region's energy needs. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s opponents agree that much is at stake, but for different reasons. They say stopping the plant is crucial for the health and safety of tens of thousands of people who live nearby. The low-power license does not settle disputes over evacuation planning for crowded beaches and coastal communities within 10 miles of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> _ the key issue blocking commercial operation. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> officials hope to receive a commercial license in the fall, but <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and other foes have promised to fight it even if it means going to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Nuclear industry officials around the world also see high stakes involved with the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> plant, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` We're aware the rest of the industry is watching us, but we're not out there fighting the industry's battles,'' he said Two weeks ago, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> attended a conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> of nuclear plant operators from 31 countries, and he said there was `` tremendous interest'' in <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>'s progress. `` When I came back I told the folks here that it really dawned on me for the first time _ there are people who perceive <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> as the bellwether,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` But I do n't. My objective is to get it running.'' When <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s tests start, valves will be opened and water will be pumped through the reactor coolant system. Friction from the rapid circulation would heat the reactor from 150 degrees to its operating temperature of 557 degrees. Then, operators would set the stage for a nuclear chain reaction by withdrawing neutron-absorbing control rods from the reactor fuel core and reducing the amount of neutron-absorbing boron in the coolant water, eventually letting uranium atoms start the fission process. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> estimated the plant would achieve initial `` criticality'' _ its first self-sustained fission reaction _ within seven to 10 days.

 A mission from the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> has failed to make any progress toward a solution of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political crisis, an opposition leader said Friday. `` Unfortunately there has been no progress for the good of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the talks,'' said opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> after meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation. The mission, made up of the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> and </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>, also met Friday with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto leader, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and first vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said the sticking point had been <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s refusal to negotiate with the opposition. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said he would not take power if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remained as commander of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> called questions about his possible retirement `` stupid.'' Earlier Friday, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told reporters that the military would not be drawn into negotiations and that a solution to the political crisis should come from talks between the opposition and pro-government parties. `` They both claim they won,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told reporters. Ecuadoran Foreign Minister <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mission had succeeded in giving <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the opposition each other's point of view, but that a solution `` will require an enormous effort from the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation seeks to end the impasse created when the government nullified the May 7 presidential election. The opposition, led by <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, won the elections over pro-government candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> by a 3-1 margin, according to international observers. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s troops seized the vote tallies and the election was nullified three days later. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said Friday: `` The key to the problem lies with the contending political parties. The opposition has declined to talk to Duque. `` If the opposition remains intransigent, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> are not going to slip on a banana peel'' and be drawn into the dispute. `` The two sides have to start talking.'' Opposition leaders say they will not negotiate with civilians because the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> commands, hold the real power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` Nothing positive can come out of a negotiation between <LOCATION> Duque </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> because <ORGANIZATION> Duque </ORGANIZATION> does n't have a single drop of power,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said Friday in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are willing to talk to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> about an institutional solution, but for this it is vital that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> retire.'' When asked to say who had won, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said, `` That's up to the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION>,'' which nullified the vote. `` I'm just another Panamanian among 2,394,000.'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> noted that, in a resolution passed before the mission was sent, the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> called for `` a transfer of power as soon as possible.'' `` They did n't talk about the presidency, but about power,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said. `` That power that is now in military hands.'' The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mission came to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s offices at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and waited 15 minutes before the general came strolling down the street with a half-dozen staff officers, munching on a mango. `` Panamanian mango,'' he remarked, taking a bite. `` You should try it.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s offices back onto a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval station and are cater-corner from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>'s logistics and personnel offices. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who also spent 2 -LCB- hours with the delegation Wednesday, said he repeated that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s problems were caused by the `` interfering hands'' of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent 1,900 more troops to augment security at <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> installations, he said, `` Panamanian troops have been instructed not to get trapped into a provocation. We also ask Panamanian citizens not to do anything provocative.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted on drug trafficking charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which he describes as part of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plot to renege on treaties that cede the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of 1999. He said the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> had made some proposals, but he would not reveal them. `` There are 100,000 formulas,'' he said. When asked if he would step down, he replied: `` Do n't ask stupid questions.'' At Wednesday's meeting, the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> was told <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s retirement was a matter for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> to consider, not the opposition or the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>. On Friday, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> called the international press `` disinformers'' and agents of imperialism. `` You are the ones who have made me out to be a dictator,'' he said to an unruly crowd of reporters, photographers and television cameramen. `` You say it's a dictatorship, but right here we have anarchy.''

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tobacco ads will be banned from public billboards in this city of 450,000 in a bid to combat tobacco-related diseases, a municipal official said. `` We think tobacco is such a threat to public health that steps should be taken quickly,'' spokesman <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellm </PERSON> said Friday. Under a city plan, the ads will be banned from The Hague's 250 advertising billboards after renewal of their annual lease contracts, he said. <PERSON> Bellm </PERSON> said the tobacco ads, on about two-thirds of the public advertising space, bring in $ 90,000 a year. He noted that in 1986, about 800 people in the city of 450,000 succumbed to tobacco-related diseases such as lung cancer, heart attacks and respiratory problems. That was the latest year for which figures are available. The Dutch government is considering extending a nationwide ban on tobacco promotion on radio and television to a more comprehensive one.

 Although <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> has been <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s supreme ruler for more than a decade, his differing approaches to economic and political change have not met with universal approval. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s market-oriented economic reforms have achieved remarkable results since 1978 and received a resounding vote of confidence at the 13th <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. Under his policies, millions of Chinese have seen their living standards increase dramatically. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who was named <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief at the <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION>, was considered <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s top protege and heir apparent because of his enthusiastic support for economic liberalism and opening up to the outside world. But <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s sympathy with student demands for free government and democratic reform apparently proved unacceptable to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, an 84-year-old revolutionary with little tolerance for dissent. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s moderate attitude toward the students resulted in his loss of power this week to conservative Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, an engineer trained in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, opposed the rapid pace of economic decentralization that was the result of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s policies He instead prefered the status quo. But <PERSON> Li </PERSON> apparently was acting on <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s behalf May 20 when he decreed martial law for <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, where students and more than 1 million supporters have been demonstrating for political liberalization. At least temporarily, supporters of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s conservative views on political change have won out over supporters of his far-reaching economic reforms. Among other leaders: President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> _ The former general has close ties to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> and has been viewed as a supporter of economic reform. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> apparently shares <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s aversion to political pluralism, however, and announced May 19 that troops were being sent to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to restore order. <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON> _ The head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is a firm supporter of the market-oriented economic reform, but may not approve <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s crackdown. During a recent trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he praised the students as leading a patriotic movement and urged a peaceful resolution to the uprising. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> _ The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> long has been viewed as a staunch conservative opposed to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s economic reform. But he made clear in a speech Friday he supports the hard-line stance against the pro-democracy movement. Joining <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> on the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> are <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>. Their support of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s economic and political policies is difficult to gauge, particularly because all of their meetings are in private.

<TEXT>
 The passions of the 16th century, burning fiercely in the Highlands of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, have driven the Lord High Chancellor from his church. Lord <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> of Clashfern, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s chief legal officer, said Friday that he would leave the Free Presbyterian Church of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> rather than promise not to attend Roman Catholic funeral Mass, as he had done twice in honor of fellow peers. `` I have no intention of giving any such undertaking as that for which the synod has asked,'' <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> said in a statement issued from his office in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Like a 16th century chancellor, Sir <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> More </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> was forced to choose between private conscience and public duty in a land where the church as well as the state derives its authority from the crown. More, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, was beheaded in 1535 after refusing to recognize <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>'s supremacy over the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>, and the rhetoric of the Reformation echoed in the church at <LOCATION> Inverness </LOCATION> where the `` Wee Frees'' held their annual synod this week. `` I find it very difficult to believe that the lord chancellor of a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> country, with a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> queen on a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> throne, has any obligation by reason of state to go to a Popish Mass,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>, clerk of the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Presbytery </LOCATION>. Lord <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawsley </PERSON>, a prominent Roman Catholic and former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> officer, put the issue this way: `` What is the lord chancellor of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, who is the head of the judiciary, doing belonging to such an intolerant organization?'' The struggle for the lord chancellor's soul was waged amid scenes of stout women weeping, solemn men stomping their feet in protest and the church's moderator, the Rev. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ndebele </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bulawayo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, banging his fist on the table for order. <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON>, an elder of his church in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, had been suspended last year following a complaint about his attendance at the funeral of Lord <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Killowan </LOCATION> at Westminster Cathedral in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He had attended another Catholic funeral in 1986. Speaking to the Lord Chancellor's opponents, the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> of <PERSON> Tain </PERSON> warned the synod that it `` will make the name of this church stink in the <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> and wherever it is known.'' `` May God have mercy upon us as a church,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> of <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, at 90 the oldest clergyman in the church. `` Lord <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> is a man whose conscience is clear before God.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> of Laide, convenor of the church's committee on religion and morals, noted that the synod had easily mustered a unanimous vote some years ago to rebuke Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> for attending a Mass. `` Yet when one of our own goes to Mass there is a big hullabaloo when he is disciplined for it,'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. The vote upholding <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON>'s suspension, by 33-27, signaled a new schism in a 6,000-member denomination born in protest in 1893. The Rev. <PERSON> Calum </PERSON> <PERSON> MacInnes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, who had once been threatened with discipline for refusing to wear a clerical collar, filed a formal protest and walked out. Besides the <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> case, <PERSON> MacInnes </PERSON> complained of a 1987 decision to refuse membership to a man whose golf club was open on Sundays, and another last year to suspend a minister who had invited a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest to pray at an education committee meeting. Appointed lord chancellor by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in 1987, the 61-year-old <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> presides over the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION>, the unelected upper house of Parliament. His tenure has been controversial because of his proposals for sweeping reform of the ancient privileges and powers of the English bar, proposals which some lawyers have resented as coming from an outsider. <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON>, with his twinkling eyes and soft smile, appears an unlikely object of controversy. The son of a railway porter, he attended <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Heriot </PERSON>'s School -LRB- `` for the improvement of the children of poor but deserving folk'' -RRB- in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> and then took a degree in mathematics and natural philosophy in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>. After lecturing for a time at <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, he turned to law in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and eventually became Lord Advocate, the top law officer in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. In an interview with author <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON>, published in The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> in February, <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> had defended his church from accusations of intolerance. `` It depends what you mean by intolerance,'' he said. `` If you believe something strongly, if that is your faith, the testimony you have received, you seek change in others by way of persuasion.''

 The trial of a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent in the Iran-Contra arms and money affair is being delayed for two weeks over allegations the prosecution is using the defendant's testimony to a congressional panel. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> on Friday moved the starting date to July 24 after ex-CIA agent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said the prosecution's case has been tainted by his immunized congressional testimony. In a related case, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> on Friday rejected a motion by former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> for a post-trial hearing. North, convicted May 4 of three felonies stemming from the Iran-Contra affair, had contended that the evidence against him was prejudiced by his testimony before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during televised hearings in 1987. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers raised no new issues to warrant another hearing or dismissal of the charges. The judge concluded in a June 16, 1988, ruling that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s congressional testimony `` was not submitted to the grand jury in any form.'' In the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case, <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> denied a motion to dismiss the case, but the judge said he will look further into what steps the prosecution took to insulate itself from <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>' testimony. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s former station chief in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, is accused of obstructing and lying to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's office and the presidential Tower commission He allegedly told investigators that a secret airstrip in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> built as part of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s secret resupply network for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels was an initiative of the Costa Rican government. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> allegedly told the Tower panel he did not know for a fact that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was assisting the resupply effort, which was prohibited by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Under immunity from prosecution, <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> later told congressional investigators the airstrip was tied into the resupply effort and that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was part of it. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said two <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> employees, <ORGANIZATION> Cole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupart </PERSON>, were familiar with <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>' immunized testimony, yet were questioned extensively by prosecutors. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Black </PERSON> maintained he was unable to `` ferret out'' what he learned from <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>' immunized testimony and what he learned from non-immunized testimony. Prosecutor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Longstreth </PERSON> disputed <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s contention, saying prosecutors' questions to <PERSON> Black </PERSON> were framed narrowly and that none of his answers was based on <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>' immunized testimony. A <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling bars prosecutors from making any use of someone's immunized testimony in prosecuting the person. The office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, which is prosecuting <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, has gone to extreme lengths to wall itself off from such testimony, <PERSON> Longstreth </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office will supply the court with information on the steps it has taken to remain free from the taint of immunized testimony, the judge said at the end of a hearing. The trial is expected to last about three weeks. Prosecutor <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Shtasel </PERSON> said the government will call 15 to 18 witnesses and take five to seven days to present its case. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the defense will take a `` similar amount of time.''

 Supermarkets in at least four cities were looted and one was set afire in unrest prompted by high inflation. No injuries were reported, but more than 90 people were arrested. Police in central <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s second-biggest city, were deployed at public buildings and radio and TV stations as well as supermarkets to ward off incidents, police and Argentine media reported. They said authorities seized firebombs. In <LOCATION> Mendoza </LOCATION>, 620 miles west of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, a supermarket was set ablaze Friday by firebombs, the news agencies <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> y </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argentinas </ORGANIZATION> reported. In the working class towns of Quilmes to the south and <LOCATION> Mataderos </LOCATION> to the west, food stores and delivery trucks were robbed, the news agencies said. Police and the news agencies reported 60 arrests in <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION>, about 25 in <LOCATION> Mataderos </LOCATION> and six in Quilmes. In <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> on Friday night, about 300 women demanding wage increases and an end to recent price rises banged pots and pans outside Government House. Inflation is projected to top 70 percent this month, wages have shrunk by more than 30 percent this year and people are hungry across this country that exports huge quantities of grain and beef. `` What I spent to buy five bottles of cooking oil last month wo n't buy even one now,'' said <PERSON> Elsa </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, a housewife at the rally in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. `` My husband works two jobs and earns about 5,000 australs'' a month, or about $ 25, she said. `` It's humiliating. It makes me sick.'' President <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lost elections May 14 to the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in large part because of the deteriorating economy. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> offered to step down before scheduled on Dec. 10; President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> declined to take office early. The Argentine currency has been devalued by 90 percent against the dollar since February. Bus and commuter train, gas, electricity, telephone and other public utility rates were increased sharply last week. Exchange houses were closed since Monday in an effort to reduce speculation against the austral. Banks, which fear a run on deposits, were closed Monday and Tuesday but resumed some transactions Wednesday. The limit for withdrawals is 20,000 australs every two days, or about $ 100. Looting of supermarkets, butcher shops, food stores and delivery trucks _ and clashes with police, who have fired tear gas and rubber bullets _ began Tuesday. Some hungry looters have eaten food on the spot. The government attributes the incidents to agitators that so far it has refused to identify. `` There is no doubt'' that the looters are organized, said <PERSON> Facundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, chief of the state intelligence agency. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> reportedly was set to address the nation Sunday to announce details of a new anti-inflation program.

 About 300 radical students went on a hunger strike outside a Roman Catholic cathedral on Friday in a protest they said was inspired by the student-led demonstrations in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The students gathered at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s Myongdong Cathedral to call for the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government and an investigation into the death of student leader <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol-gyu </PERSON>. `` Overthrow the murder regime!'' and `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' protesters chanted as riot police watched but made no move to intervene. The peaceful protest strike was called amid growing pressure on students to end their violent protests. South Korean newspapers have praised the Chinese student protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for their peaceful tactics in calling for freedom and democracy. About 3,000 students went on a hunger strike in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on May 13 to dramatize their demands. That hunger strike was lifted a week later. South Korean student leaders said Friday they were using the same tactics as Chinese students. Some students claimed they would fast to the death if their demands were not met. `` We are more determined than the students fasting in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' one student said. About 100 students chanted slogans at the cathedral's main gate. Others rested in the cathedral compound or took part in discussion groups, taking water but no food. Students stayed out of the cathedral itself and administration buildings. The Korean students are pro-leftist and anti-Western, rejecting Western democracy as unsuitable for Korean conditions and calling for an ill-defined `` workers and farmers state.'' The Chinese students are demonstrating for a freer society and an end to official corruption, but are not calling for an overthrow of the communist system. Radical students in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> lack popular support because of their extreme views and violent tactics. Some student groups have been trying to switch tactics after six riot police officers were killed May 3 in a clash in the southern city of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>. A seventh trooper injured in the clash died Thursday night, police said. Radical students and dissidents claim <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was tortured and killed by police and are demanding the government admit there has been a cover up. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s body was found May 10 in a reservoir near the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. Dissident groups called for a major demonstration in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Saturday to protest <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s death, but police banned the rally. Officials deny involvement in <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s death, although police tried to detain him at a roadblock just before he disappeared. The government says an autopsy proves <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was not tortured and officials speculate he fell into the reservoir. Posters with color pictures of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s bloated body were put up Friday by students in the cathedral compound. Crowds of up to 100,000 people marched in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> last week to demand the government admit police killed <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. The demonstrations also called for <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s fall for the bloody suppression of a 1980 uprising in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. The hunger strikers in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said Friday they also were demanding <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s ouster for the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> uprising. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was a senior general during the uprising. Protesters also chanted anti-U.S. slogans Friday. They claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was involved in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> and are demanding expulsion of the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Saturday editions that <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said in an interview he would give up his leadership post as soon as a replacement is picked and would resign his <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat on June 15, his 47th birthday. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> declined comment through a spokesman Friday night. The congressman did not return messages left at his home. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said, `` In the current environment, realistically, there might be a long period of inquiry which he feels would be damaging to the party or to the House for which he has deep affection.'' `` He just said he could n't be an effective majority leader with these charges out there,'' a top Democratic leadership source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The source, who insisted on anonymity, said <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> felt he could not remain as an effective whip and thus saw no reason to remain in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 3 Democrat, told the Times he was taking the actions to avoid a protracted investigation of his personal finances. `` I want to give my party a chance to move on,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. `` I do n't intend to put my party through more turmoil,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> told the Times. `` I do n't intend to put this institution through more turmoil. And more importantly, I do n't intend to put my family through more turmoil.'' `` If I ca n't be leader and if I ca n't be whip, it's time to try a new and different challenge. Therefore, June 15, which is my 47th birthday, will be my last day in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' the paper quoted him as saying. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> acknowledged that a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings and loan executive set him up in a junk bond investment that netted him a $ 6,882 profit without him having to put up any of his own money. However, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> had said that except for some reporting errors the 1986 deal was `` totally above board'' and he did nothing wrong. A source close to <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said Friday night that `` He basically said he's devoted 25 years to public life, he has worked for social change, and he has spent too much time trying to build the party up. He does n't want his attention or abilities distracted in this fashion. `` He has been told by his attorneys that he has no legal difficulties,'' the source said. `` But he just thinks enough is enough. He does not want to put his party through it.'' The source said the resignation is expected to be announced in a statement to be released Saturday. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> has been a rising star in the Democratic firmament in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and his aides were busily spreading the word earlier in the day that he intended to try and move up to majority leader if <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigns, as expected next week, and Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> becomes speaker. At the same time, some Democrats expressed concern privately over the possible political damage to the party if <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> took on a more prominent role at a time when his business dealings were coming under close scrutiny on the heels of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s apparently unsuccessful campaign to fend off multiple ethics allegations. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said, `` I think this is a loss for the House of Representatives ... He's had a brilliant record as chairman of the campaign committee and as the party whip, and I think he'll be deeply missed by his colleagues and by the constituents he served so well.'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s reported decision could result in a political free-for-all when <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats meet to select new leaders. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> is widely expected to be the next speaker, assuming that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigns next week as expected, and the jockeying already had begun to fill the other rungs on the leadership ladder. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s reported decision would bring an end to a successful career in the House. The Californian was widely respected and liked by other Democrats for his work as chairman of the party's campaign committee, which raised funds and provided campaign services for the party's candidates. A report released by <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> on May 14 showed that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assn </ORGANIZATION>. of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, purchased $ 100,000 in bonds for <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> and held them until <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> could raise money to pay for them. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> also provided half of the money to finance the bonds. The bond was sold to <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> by the executive a month later at the initial offering price, saving <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> about $ 4,000 compared to the bond's market price at the time. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported this week that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was opening a criminal investigation of whether <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> received favored treatment, but <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said the story was wrong. However, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> acknowledged that he regretted the deal. He put his personal funds into a blind trust last year, and he said he wished he had done it earlier. According to <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s report, he first considered investing his 1986 campaign funds in 12 -LCB- percent bonds, based on a suggestion by <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> ruled out that type of investment for his campaign, but <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> suggested the congressman himself could make an investment in the bonds. In the report earlier this month, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, concluded that <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>'s role in the transaction could not be considered a `` gift'' which would violate <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, because <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> paid him interest.

 The voracious Japanese appetite for sea urchins has created a booming market for the spiny creatures, and <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> researchers want to develop an even better version. `` Presently, if you take 100, you might get 50 or 60 in a load that are grade A color,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, extension marine program coordinator. `` We're trying to get it up to 80 or better. In the Japanese market, which is very fussy, if you can produce a reliable product, that is worth more.'' Sea urchin gourmets consume the eggs, or roe. Researchers hope they will get greater quantities of roe and give it the colors considered most desirable by Japanese diners if they keep urchins in pens and feed them kelp and fish byproducts, <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> said. The new, improved urchins could double or triple a seller's income A state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> official does n't believe the project will make anybody rich because `` ranching'' the urchins will probably not be economically feasible. `` That's one of their pipe dreams,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Averill </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` The price is n't there. They are n't going to get any more for that urchin than the wild harvester is.'' <PERSON> Averill </PERSON> said the industry has been around for 25 or 30 years in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, but it really took off in the last three years because of the yen's high value in relation to the dollar. `` We are estimating that 10 million pounds were shipped last season,'' he said. `` That's up from like 6 million a year before that, and there was like 1 million the year before that. You can estimate 35 cents a pound. On 10 million pounds, that's $ 3.5 million.'' When the value of the yen drops in relation to the dollar, the Japanese are likely to start shopping elsewhere for their urchins, <PERSON> Averill </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s urchins are not much different from other urchins, and people harvesting them here do n't always know how to pick the best ones, he said. `` There's been a tremendous amount of urchins rejected for quality reasons,'' <PERSON> Averill </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> has a so-so reputation.'' <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> maintains the research could lead to superior sea urchins of a bright yellow color favored by many Japanese. `` They can range from a muddy brown to a rain-slicker yellow, with several cream colors at the other end of the spectrum,'' <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> said. `` If they have a bright yellow color, it gives them a sweetish flavor. It can almost be a honey flavor.'' <PERSON> Averill </PERSON> said the state and the university have developed a color chart that the Japanese can use in ordering urchins that will be pleasing to the eye. The roe color preferred by the diners varies from city to city in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and the chart gave <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> urchin sellers a better idea of what to send. `` After you've been looking at sea urchins all day, they start to look alike,'' <PERSON> Averill </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> tries to discourage the notion that someone can easily start making money in the sea urchin business, pointing out that someone needs the proper equipment and needs to know how to harvest the creatures. `` Neither the roe improvement nor the wild harvesting are gold-rush industries,'' <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> said. `` They're not get-rich-quick schemes. It's damn hard work and a very fussy market.''

<TEXT>
 Citing concerns of residents fearful of crime and addicts in their neighborhoods, former first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> just said no to plans for a drug rehabilitation center that would bear her name. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cited local concerns for her decision to abandon the $ 10 million <ORGANIZATION> Nancy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION>, a spokesman said Friday. `` There is a God. I'm on the verge of tears,'' said <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> View </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terrace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeowners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the group opposing the center. `` I think it shows you can beat city hall. `` Despite all the pressures that people with money and power can put on a mixed community of all races and incomes, they can still pull together to defend themselves and win.'' Residents of the rustic <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Terrace </LOCATION> neighborhood 20 miles northwest of downtown had objected to the drug treatment center, claiming it could bring crime to the neighborhood and traffic jams when Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visited it. <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which operates 10 drug treatment centers nationwide, said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to withdraw ended its efforts to take over the closed <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> View </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terrace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, but indicated another <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> location would be sought to bear Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s name. The former first lady `` has been deeply impressed by many treatment programs, especially <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which enjoys a well-deserved reputation for excellence,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> family spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said. `` But Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> respects the concerns of those in the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Terrace </LOCATION> neighborhood. She regrets that this situation has upset members of the community.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has continued her `` Just Say No'' anti-drug crusade since moving back to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earlier this year. `` <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> understands Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desire to change the proposed site of the <ORGANIZATION> Nancy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>. `` Accordingly we will terminate our agreement to purchase the former <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> View </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in Lake View Terrace.'' <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said the organization remained `` committed to meeting the treatment needs of young drug abusers in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>.'' Another location in the area would be sought, she said. Snow said he learned of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to withdraw during a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Nancy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> chief of staff <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON>, the lobbyist hired by the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> View </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terrace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeowners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were dumbfounded,'' Snow said. `` Of the 500 things on my list of things to come up in the meeting, that was not one of them.'' On March 8, the proposed drug center had won a conditional use permit from the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which placed strict security requirements on the site, and a two-year limit to the operating permit. Associate Zoning Administrator <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said then that <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would have to erect a seven-foot wrought-iron fence around the center, maintain a 24-hour guard at the front gate, and place video surveillance cameras inside the center. <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was to have 210 beds, a residential high school and treatment center for as many as 150 teen-agers and 60 young adults. Snow said a planned June 4 demonstration in front of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> home had been canceled. `` We'll probably have some kind of neighborhood rally instead,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> is trying to decide whether <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s ban on capital punishment can be used to block the extradition of a juvenile facing a possible death sentence in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, an attorney for the 17-year-old boy identified only by the initials <PERSON> O.M. </PERSON>, urged a three-judge panel of the court Friday to overturn a lower court ruling that <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s extradition bid must be honored. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said the district government's death penalty prohibition must override its obligation under the Interstate Compact on Juveniles, the agreement which requires states to honor each other's extradition requests for juveniles. But <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON>, assistant corporation counsel for the district government, said the interstate compact does not give the district the discretion to impose its anti-death penalty policy on <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> or any other state. The three-judge panel court did not indicate when it would rule, although it agreed in March to handle the case on an expedited basis. O.M. was arrested by district police last December on juvenile charges of arson and murder stemming from a May 1988 firebombing in <LOCATION> Gadsden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, which killed 14-month-old <PERSON> Tamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. His uncle, <PERSON> Yul </PERSON> <PERSON> Devoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Guice </PERSON>, 31, also has been charged with arson and murder in the case. O.M.'s lawyers contend the youth, who is black, will not be treated fairly the all-white judicial system in <LOCATION> Gadsden </LOCATION>. District City Councilwoman <PERSON> Wilhelmina </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolark </PERSON>, chairman of the council's judiciary committee, has introduced emergency legislation to prohibit the district from extraditing any juvenile facing a potential death sentence unless the state involved certifies that it will not seek the death penalty. A hearing on her bill is set for Tuesday. During Friday's hearing, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, another attorney for <LOCATION> O.M. </LOCATION>, argued that the interstate compact is not valid in the district because its ratification papers never were published in city regulations, as required by a 1984 district law. One judge indicated that <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s argument might provide sufficient grounds to overturn the order that O.M. be returned to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is expected to rule in July whether imposing the death sentence on murderers who commit their crimes before age 18 violates the Constitution's ban on `` cruel and unusual punishment.''

 A former rebel leader returned home after more than two years in exile and became the first to sign a document saying she did not support armed struggle against the leftist government. `` I have been forced to fulfill a requirement in order to be allowed back into my own country,'' <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>, a former member of the Nicaraguan Resistance directorate, said upon her return Friday. `` But the struggle of the Nicaraguan people is well worth bending one's pride.'' About 40 cheering supporters, most of them from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, greeted Ms. <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>'s flight from <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. `` At this time the battlefield is on the political field,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON> said when asked if her return meant she had cut ties to the rebels, known as Contras. The U.S.-backed rebels have fought the leftist Sandinista government since 1981.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced it has readjusted a key supplemental housing allowance and more than 800,000 people in the military services will see a small increase in that part of their paycheck. The change in the variable housing allowance, set to begin June 1, will be the second increase this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> declined to estimate the average increase on a percentage basis, saying all the geographic factors had n't been computed. But figures released by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suggest the increase will exceed this year's first hike of 3.4 percent, and will range from an average $ 4.80 a month extra for a private to $ 13.01 a month extra for a colonel. Military officials boosted the allowance in January, deliberately holding down the size of that hike to make sure the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> did n't exceed a congressional limit of $ 1.22 billion for the entire program.

<HEAD>No Answers In What Caused Office Workers To Become Ill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Even after tests on air, food and water, and blood samples from the victims, authorities have yet to find a cause for 62 office workers becoming so ill that they had to be treated at hospitals. `` We may never find out,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, acting director of the city and county health department's environmental health division. `` We've done everything possible in the analytical viewpoint. We went from roof to basement and we did n't find anything.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and others investigating the phenomenon are considering such causes as lingering airborne pesticides and Sick Building Syndrome at the Pioneer TeleTechnologies office where the employees took sick Thursday night. Sick Building Syndrome is an illness associated with new or renovated buildings that have a lot of synthetic materials and poor ventilation. The telemarketing office was renovated six months ago. But every test that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and other health and emergency service workers performed provided no insight about the cause. `` We've tested all of that with very sophisticated equipment and we've found nothing,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Friday. About 7:30 p.m. a pregnant worker became ill at the telemarketing office in the lower level of a shopping center, and a paramedic was called. Shortly after that, a second pregnant woman became ill and another ambulance was summoned. About 9:45 p.m., the paramedics were called a third time. This time, it was for dozens of people complaining of headaches, dizziness and nausea. Three paramedics and a two firefighters also became ill. By 10 p.m., ambulances were taking people to four hospitals and medical centers But it did n't end there. Workers who went home had delayed reactions. Several were picked up at their homes by paramedics and taken to the hospital. Business was normal at the shopping center Friday, but the telemarketing company was closed, and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said it was unknown when it would reopen. Hospital spokesmen who declined to give out specific information said that only a few people remained hospitalized for further observation. The others were treated and released.

 Rain has ended a three-month drought, but it came too late to save much of the rice that most of this impoverished nation's 110 million people rely upon, farmers and officials said. `` Last week's rain should have come at least a month ago. Now there is water, but the damage is already done,'' said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Jalil </PERSON>, a farmer who has to feed 24 people in his family. Agriculture officials said the rain can save only 40 percent of the rice crop near this village about 130 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. In some areas the loss is estimated at 80 percent, the officials said on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Jalil </PERSON> planted rice on the two acres he owns and was planning to sell the expected harvest of 22,800 pounds. `` But this year I will have to buy rice from the market to feed my family,'' he said, sitting at the edge of his withered rice paddies. <PERSON> Jalil </PERSON>, 40, said he was still trying to repay a bank loan taken to offset losses during last summer's floods. The deluge inundated four-fifths of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, killing at least 1,400 people and destroying 2.5 million tons of rice and wheat. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, one of the poorest countries in the world with annual per capita income of $ 160, alternates between flood and drought. These and other natural disasters such as tornadoes and cyclones have crippled government efforts to improve the economy. Almost 80 percent of the population depends on agriculture. In good years, the country produces about 17 million of the 18.5 million tons of grain needed to feed itself. The rest is imported. Economists fear this year's drought will prompt a food shortage. `` Though the government claims it has adequate food stock, we are apprehensive. The effect of drought on the economy is going to be significant,'' said <PERSON> Khwaja </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamsul </PERSON> <PERSON> Huq </PERSON>, head of he <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agencies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. The group is a coalition of more than 100 local and foreign non-government organizations. The government says it has a food grain reserve of 800,000 tons and plans to import 2 million tons more. <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last year's flood and the current drought may push the deficit to 3 million tons. The officials said 80 percent of the shallow wells in the area had run dry. Deep wells, reaching nearly 500 feet underground, still functioned, but these accounted for only 10 percent of the total wells. <PERSON> Sheikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Surat </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Taraganj </LOCATION> farmer, said his village had only one pump to operate wells that irrigate more than 40 acres. `` But that also did not work'' for most of April. `` Today I got water but it will be 15 days before my next turn,'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said, wiping his brow with his tattered sarong. He said 50 farmers share the pump. Officials and economists say relying on deep wells also lowers the water table. A National Disaster Planning Council has discussed building canals for more water. It also wants to improve techniques to evacuate people during floods. But the plan has a $ 7 billion price tag and the government is seeking foreign donations to implement it. `` We are tied in a vicious circle. Flooding this year, drought next year. It seems we have no escape from natural disasters,'' a Planning Ministry official said on condition of anonymity.

 The government and opposition appeared no closer to resolving the presidential election crisis after a visit by representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>. The opposition said Friday that Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto ruler, must be a party to any negotiations. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, however, insisted the opposition must negotiate with pro-government parties. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mission, scheduled to leave today, had hoped to help resolve an impasse that arose when the government nullified the May 7 presidential elections. International observers said the opposition won by a 3-1 margin. `` At this time what we hoped for has not been achieved, an agreement among Panamanians to resolve the crisis that bedevils <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' opposition candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said Friday after meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation. A member of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, said the opposition and government `` understand each other better, but it will require an enormous effort from the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people because they have to develop the formulas to solve the problem.'' The other members of the mission were the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> and </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. The delegation must file a report the day before the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers meet on June 6 to consider the organization's next step. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said he would not accept the presidency on Sept. 1, even if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> allowed it but remained commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces. `` I would just be a puppet,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said. The opposition has said repeatedly that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the Defense Forces hold real power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and therefore must be a part of any talks. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, at a news conference after his own meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation, said: `` The key to the problem lies with the contending political parties ... If the opposition remains intransigent, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> are not going to slip on a banana peel'' and be drawn into the dispute. `` The two sides have to start talking,'' he said. `` They both claim they won.'' He said questions about the possibility of his own resignation were `` stupid.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who was indicted in February 1988 on drug charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said he told the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s problems were caused by `` interfering hands.'' He cited the drug charges, which he denies, and economic sanctions as proof that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was plotting to keep the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> despite treaties that call for the canal to be turned over at the end of 1999.

 For slot machine players who feel they `` get no respect,'' billionaire <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s casino presents the ultimate in pampering. Not one to ignore customers with big bucks, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has created an elegant slot machine section away from the run-of-the-mill tourists on the main casino floor. Mind you, this posh place is not for those customers who gamble with quarters and nickels. The `` Monte Carlo Casino,'' which opens this weekend at Trump Castle Hotel and Casino, features three $ 100 slot machines _ one with a $ 400,000 jackpot _ seven $ 25 slots and 51 $ 5 slots. If slot players invest enough, they will be treated just like the high roller in the baccarat pit. The new section, which cost $ 1.5 million to furnish and equip, has been enclosed with marble walls, brass rails and etched glass. Flowering plants line the sides. Deluxe chairs with armrests face each slot machine, and phone jacks are available alongside. The `` <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambassadors </ORGANIZATION>'' _ butlers in tuxedos _ will provide every amenity: light snacks, slippers for tired feet, a neck massage and even a hot towel to wipe hands that have been dirtied by those big-buck tokens. `` Traditionally, slot players are handed a Wet-Nap at the cashier's window,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jeanine </PERSON> <PERSON> Repa </PERSON>. `` We wanted to take things a step up for our preferred customers.''

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressman convicted of having sex with a 16-year-old girl will run for re-election despite a call for his resignation from a fellow representative, an aide said. Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, `` will be spending some quiet time, speaking to family and friends to get a lot of opinion and advice. But I'll say this, we will be running,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' chief of staff, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was convicted Friday of contributing to the delinquency and unruliness of a minor after a <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Domestic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated for an hour and a half. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> faces a maximum sentence on the misdemeanor charge of 180 days in jail and a $ 1,000 fine. Within an hour after the conviction, the senior Republican of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation called for <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> to step down. `` I think he should do the gentlemanly thing and resign,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> showed no expression during the reading of the verdict.

The charge stemmed from an Nov. 6 incident at <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' apartment in which 16-year-old <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> was paid $ 40 to have sex him. Neither Miss <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> nor her mother, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>, was in the courtroom when the verdict was read.

<HEAD>New Collectors' Item? _ Quarters With No Mint Mark</HEAD>

 Coin experts say some 1989 quarters could be worth hundreds of dollars because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mint unwittingly struck an unknown number of them with no mint mark. Readers of the Numismatic News, a weekly coin collector's publication based in <LOCATION> Iola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, sent in two 1989 quarters missing the mint mark, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today A spokesman for Stack's, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> coin dealer, said the 1989 quarter could be worth $ 250 to $ 1,000, based on prices of other coins with similar errors. All of the 605.9 million 1989 quarters already minted should bear a mark just to the right of the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s head that tells where the coin was minted. A `` P'' indicates the mint at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and a `` D'' the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> mint.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who says he will resign to take responsibility for an influence-peddling scandal, has decided to back Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> as his successor, news reports said today. Nearly all major newspapers carried front-page reports of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> choosing to support Uno, although most said the situation remained fluid. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s appointment would fill a leadership vacuum that has plagued the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> since <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced last month that he would resign. Many party members previously mentioned as potential successors were believed tainted by the scandal. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was believed to have discussed the succession problem today with party Secretary General <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> at a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> hospital, where <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> is recovering from surgery. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told reporters a choice would not be made until late next week following discussions with other party elders, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and other news reports said. Party leaders said <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> emerged as the top contender after talks on Friday between <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' policy-making Executive Council, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> newspapers. Uno, 66, a 10-term member of the powerful lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and foreign minister since 1987, also has held the international trade and industry portfolio and served as party deputy secretary general. `` We have n't received any word from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>,'' an official at Uno's office in <LOCATION> Moriyama </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said on condition of anonymity. A spokesman for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> refused to comment. A Foreign Ministry official said <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was to leave Sunday for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to attend a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. He is to return June 4. Party leaders reportedly favor <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> because he has experience in foreign affairs and apparently is untainted by the Recruit bribery scandal, which already has led to more than a dozen arrests. Uno faces some opposition, however, because he is a leading member of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> faction headed by <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, who testified before parliament this week about his links to the scandal The <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the publishing and information services conglomerate at the center of the scandal, is accused of trying to influence government policy by selling underpriced, unlisted shares in a real estate subsidiary and by doling out millions of dollars in political contributions. The scandal has led to the downfall of three <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers and the arrest of a former chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary. Many governing party members have called it the worst crisis since the party was founded 34 years ago. In the meeting with <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> on Friday, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> agreed to stay on as prime minister until a successor is found, although on April 25 he vowed to leave when the year's budget cleared parliament. The budget is due to become law on Sunday. The head of the governing party routinely serves as prime minister because of the party's large majority in both houses of parliament. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>'s refusal May 13 to take the top job created a leadership vacuum in a governing party desperately in need of a leader with a clean enough reputation to steer the party out of scandal.

<HEAD>Investigators Focus on Dents in Fuel Pipeline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials investigating a pipeline explosion that killed at least two people are focusing on dents that were not discovered in a check of the line made after a train derailment two weeks earlier. Meanwhile, many residents evacuated from the neighborhood on Thursday were expected to be allowed to return home today. Few among the estimated 96 displaced families voiced much willingness to do so. `` They told us the gas line was no danger, but you can see for yourself that this place looks like a bomb exploded,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Liti </PERSON>, 54, whose 9-year-old son suffered burns in the fire. `` None of us can ever forget.'' The pipeline fire destroyed 10 houses across the street from the vacant lots left after the freight train derailed two weeks ago. That accident killed four people and destroyed six houses. Heavy pieces of debris from the May 12 freight train wreck were found embedded around the 14-inch diameter line, the closest about 15 inches away, federal investigators announced Friday. Federal investigators could not say if the metal fragments found near the line had caused the rupture, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>, acting chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Surface dents on the steel pipeline range up to about 30 inches long and 4 inches wide, <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said. The section bearing the 30-inch by 4-inch rupture was being removed for laboratory tests in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A section of the damaged line that was excavated revealed a blown-out hole, with a dent directly across the gash. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Andries </PERSON>, operations manager of <ORGANIZATION> Calnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the line, said the section of pipe where the rupture occurred was n't excavated in spot checks of the line for damage caused by the wreck. Instead, holes were dug every 50 feet along the 2,000-foot stretch of track involved in the derailment to check for damage, he said. Two larger areas were excavated, including one spot where a locomotive dug into the ground. The fire that raged all day Thursday as unleaded gasoline gushed from the pipe was so intense that it has been difficult to identify, or even count, the dead, authorities said. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner's office has identified only one of the victims so far _ <PERSON> Darie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 54.

 Teamsters international Vice President <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> has been fined $ 35,000 and sentenced to four years of probation for arranging a `` ghost employee'' scheme in which people received union pay for little or no work. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> also Friday granted <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>'s request to retain his various union leadership positions pending an appeal of his conviction on embezzlement and racketeering charges to the 6th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, 66, held a finger to his lips while White announced the sentence. The Teamsters official then turned and smiled at friends and relatives who applauded the sentence. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> could have been sentenced to 52 years in prison and fined $ 70,000. A co-defendant, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, was fined $ 30,000 and also was put on probation for four years. He faced a possible 45-year prison term and $ 60,000 fine. `` Justice really prevailed,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said after the sentencing. `` Our appeal will be better.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jigger </PERSON>, a government prosecutor, declined to comment after the sentencing. He had asked White to impose a `` substantial'' sentence, saying, `` <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> abused his position of trust.'' <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> was a longtime ally of former <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> international President <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, who had been indicted in the same case but died before going on trial. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cambria </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, made an impassioned appeal during a two-hour morning hearing, asking White to avoid imposing a prison term and to allow <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> to keep his union jobs pending appeal. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> also serves as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> 41 in northeast <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, Teamsters Local 507 and Bakery Workers Local 19. `` I do n't believe I did anything dishonest,'' <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> was convicted Jan. 13 of two counts of labor racketeering, one count of embezzlement and one count of filing false reports.

 The government deployed 7,000 riot police in central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> today to block a protest by dissidents calling for the fall of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. Troopers arrested more than 500 people. Hundreds of troopers in green combat fatigues with shields blocked off the park where the rally was to be held. Others guarded main streets, subway stations and government buildings to prevent protests. Several hundred people tried to stage protests or march downtown after being blocked from assembling at the rally site. Bands of radical students who tried to march in the center of the city were dragged away by police after they laid down in the middle of the road. Troopers stopped and questioned people, searched bags and took away suspects for further questioning. Police officials said more than 500 people were arrested. It was the second Saturday in a row that the government blocked a protest in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> with a massive show of police strength. Few people responded to widespread appeals by dissidents to take part in the protests. Dissidents and radical students have little public support because of their violent tactics and extremist views. Opposition to the dissidents has increased since seven riot troopers were killed by radical students earlier this month. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the main dissident alliance which called for protests in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and 10 other cities, had predicted up to 100,000 people would demonstrate nationwide. The only other reported protest involved about 2,000 people in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. About 300 radical students continued a hunger protest for a second day at <ORGANIZATION> Myongdong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> in the city center today to demand the fall of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and a government admission that police killed a radical student. Riot police ringed the cathedral but made no move to stop the protest. Some of the hunger strikers bit their fingers to draw blood, with which they wrote anti-government slogans. About 500 students were blocked by riot police when they attempted to march out of <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in western <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Students pushed and hit police with sticks, but were not able to break through lines of troopers with interlocked shields. `` Bury <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' students shouted. Dissidents are demanding an investigation into the death of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol-kyu </PERSON>, who they claim was tortured and killed by police. His body was found in a reservoir May 10 near the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. The government says police chased <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> after stopping him at a roadblock, but deny any official involvement in the death. The government says an autopsy shows <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> drowned, and officials speculate he fell into the reservoir and drowned by accident.

 Federal officials refused to discuss a broadcast report that a federal grand jury is investigating allegations of Clean Water Act violations in the Exxon Valdez oil spill. `` Obviously, one method of investigating would be a grand jury,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaan </PERSON> said Friday.

In March, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the agency was focusing on possible felony violations of the Clean Water Act. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said its investigation into the March 24 spill of nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil was continuing in cooperation with a number of agencies, among them the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The Clean Water Act prohibits the willful or negligent discharge of oil into navigable waters, said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberger </PERSON>, an environmental protection specialist for the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. `` The whole jurisdiction for us to write regulations ... to assess penalities and fines'' is packaged in the act, he said. `` It gives federal agencies the jurisdiction to do what they do.'' <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation will be lengthy. He said he could not specify a time frame. `` We're just beginning, really,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has taken responsibility for the damage that occurred when its tanker hit a charted reef in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, but has insisted the company was not negligent in its safety precautions.

<HEAD>Wall Street's Hope for Summer: Easier Credit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hopes are spreading on Wall Street that investors will get invited to a financial party this summer catered by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The festivities would have a simple theme: Lower interest rates and higher stock prices, courtesy of an easier credit policy from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. Talk of such a celebration has been increasing for some time now, ever since signs began to show up that the economy was beginning to slow. Inflation, the target of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s long credit-tightening campaign from early 1988 through the first couple of months of this year, has n't been quite so cooperative. To judge from the latest readings, it's still running at a 5 percent to 6 percent annual rate that government officials, and a good many other observers, consider troublesome. But optimists in the financial world still seem willing to bet that a slower pace of business will sooner or later ease upward pressure on the cost of living. Conjecture about a change of course at the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has also been fanned lately by the sharp rise of the dollar in foreign exchange. Presumably, a sustained advance in the dollar would be unwelcome in policymaking circles, because it would threaten to reverse the difficult progress that has been made toward shrinking the nation's trade deficit So far, efforts to keep the dollar stable have consisted mainly of intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and other banks in the foreign exchange markets. If that proves insufficient, the reasoning goes, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might want to lower interest rates in this country to reduce the flow of international funds into dollars. For the moment, the dollar's strength seems to have worked in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets' favor. `` Whether this marks a major turn in the dollar remains to be seen,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON> in his investment advisory letter The Zweig Forecast. `` However, in recent days there has been a sharp pickup in foreign demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks as those abroad fear they may miss the boat on the dollar.'' The 6-month-old rally in stock prices leveled off in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had climbed 119.14 points over the two preceding weeks, slipped back 7.33 to 2,493.77. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index edged up .39 to 179.31; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 3.16 to 445.21, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up 1.18 at 355.01. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 169.79 million shares a day, against 192.71 million the week before. As popular as it may have become, the belief that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is succeeding in curbing inflation without tipping the economy into a recession is not yet universally embraced on Wall Street. `` To an economist, the main problem with the soft landing hypothesis is that it is hard to understand the practical mechanics of slowing growth enough to lower inflation without creating the stress of a recession first,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` In fact, our experience with such happy events is almost completely lacking.'' Said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, `` the trend in stock and bond prices is positive. This is being driven by some measure of speculation in the dollar, which has been transmitted to our stock and bond markets. This can change. `` The current forecast of a soft landing, which is driving the dollar and the stock and bond markets, may change. It may change at a time when the stock market is perhaps ` overvalued,' and therefore vulnerable.''

 Here is the text of a statement issued today by Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., announcing his resignation as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority whip and from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>: For nearly 25 years, I have devoted my life to public service -- first as a congressional staffer, then as congressman, campaign committee chair, and majority whip All that time, I have worked for social change, for wider acceptance of the disabled, for the interests of my district, and to serve the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In recent weeks, my ability to complete those missions has been diminished by needless and baseless charges about my investments or private life. I have simply spent too much time building the party and trying to help people to have my attention or abilities devoted to such distractions. Accordingly, I will not seek the office of majority leader. Instead, I will tender my resignation as majority whip, and will also resign my seat in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ on my -LRB- 47th -RRB- birthday _ June 15th. All week, my colleagues have expressed their confidence in me and their support for a leader's race. I would have preferred to land in that race with both feet, and would have had the votes to win. Moreover, my attorneys remain convinced that a normal business transaction, admittedly marred by reporting errors, posed no legal problems for me, and I accept their advice. Undoubtedly, some will think this decision was motivated by weakness in my political standing or my legal position. They are entitled to their opinion, but they are wrong. I want to thank my family, my party and colleagues, my country and especially my constituents for all the opportunities I have enjoyed. I particularly want to thank the community of the disabled for all the strength they've given my for so many years. While I will no longer be working in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON>, my daughters and I look forward to conquering new horizons. I always have, and we always will.

 Leaders of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s student protest movement proposed today that thousands of demonstrators hold a final rally next week and then end their two-week occupation of Tiananmen Square. Also today, in the first official acknowledgement of a power struggle at the top, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s former President <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON> accused `` certain people in the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'' of creating confusion in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The statement, broadcast on state-run radio and television, came two days after <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> was reportedly stripped of power and placed under house arrest for apparently being too sympathetic to the protesters' demands for democratic reforms. Student leaders <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wu'er </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kaixi </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Chai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ling </PERSON>, at a news conference on the square, called for a citywide march and mass rally on Tuesday after which students would leave the square. The three, the top leaders of the uprising, said they wanted to leave the square because of `` sanitation and to return the square to the people.'' They demanded an end to martial law ordered for parts of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on May 20 by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and the withdrawal of the tens of thousands of army troops surrounding the capital. The student leaders said the approximately 10,000 students remaining in the square would make the final decision on whether to leave. They said student representatives would begin tonight meeting with groups of students to reach a final decision on whether to end the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> protest. They also called for April 27 to be made into a holiday for freedom and democracy. On that date, hundreds of thousands of students and workers took to the streets in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to protest a People's Daily editorial accusing the student movement of causing turmoil. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jianjun </PERSON>, a junior at <ORGANIZATION> Liaoning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fuxing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, said the activism displayed in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities should be brought to rural areas. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, who was at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> train station to return home today, also said: `` The conditions are really bad at the square. A lot of people are tired of living out there.'' Students began leading organized demonstrations on April 15 to demand talks with officials on democratic reforms and ending corruption and profiteering by party officials. The rallies gradually escalated, drawing many verage citizens, and culminated with the occupation of the square by hundreds of thousands and a hunger strike by 3,000 students in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on May 13, two days before Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s historic visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> At times a million people swarmed through the square and city. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> declared martial law on May 20, but soldiers either were reluctant or unable to move against the jubiliant masses. The protests caused a power struggle between more moderate leaders and hardliners, with <PERSON> Li </PERSON> apparently emerged victorious. The student leaders did not mention another march, planned for Sunday, in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Student activists in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> had called for a worldwide march of ethnic Chinese and a citywide strike in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Most people do not work in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Sunday. In a shrill speech, former President <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON> also was quoted as urging a crackdown on a small band of criminals who, he said, were trying to overthrow the rule of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` These people have an organization, a plan and a plot,'' he said. `` If they succeed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will be thrown into a deep disaster.'' In another blow to the moderate faction led by <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, chairman of the standing committee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, threw his support to Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and other conservatives who ordered martial law Wan, a moderate, cut short his visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> earlier this week and was initially reported to be placed under house arrest on his arrival in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> Tuesday. His statement today, also read on state-run radio and television, indicated that whatever help he could have provided <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> had been neutralized by conservatives. `` After I had time to study the situation,'' Wan was quoted as saying, `` I realized that a small minority was behind a plot to cause turmoil in society.'' <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> said he would call a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> around June 20 to discuss some of the student's demands, including their opposition to corruption But, he said, changes must come `` slowly because society is very complex.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON>, in his speech to the Chinese Political Consultative Conference, said part of the current `` disturbances'' were caused by the fact that campaigns to fight `` bourgeois liberalization'' were not carried out fully. Hundreds of moderate intellectuals were criticized in the 1987 campaign. Books and movies were banned and press censorship was tightened. Another reason, he said, was the activities of `` certain people in the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' The reference appeared to be to <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. Signs that the military, blocked so far by popular resistance, might move soon to end the students' two-week occupation of the square were growing. Plainclothes officers, wearing military pants, were seen strolling in pairs around the square this morning. Long lines of students formed at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> railway station waiting for trains to the provinces. Student broadcasts, quoting railway officials, said 26,000 left <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Thursday and that the number of departures was growing. The government has given students priority in getting tickets to expedite their departure from the city. Smaller numbers of students continued to arrive in the capital despite a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> order issued Thursday that students be prevented from boarding trains for <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Guerrilla Killed, Two Israeli Soldiers Wounded In Border Attack</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Jordan saying attacker may have been

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Israeli troops shot and killed a guerrilla today after he opened fire from the Jordanian side of the border, the army said. Two soldiers were slightly wounded, it said. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, in an official broadcast, suggested the attacker was a distraught Jordanian soldier who had abandoned his observation post at the border. The attack occurred about 6:30 a.m. near the kibbutz, or communal settlement, of <LOCATION> Hamadiya </LOCATION>, the military command said. <LOCATION> Hamadiya </LOCATION> is 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The Israeli army said one of its patrols near a border fence `` encountered light weapons fire from east of the fence'' and returned fire. Soldiers searched the area after the firefight and found the body of a guerrilla dressed in a military-type uniform and armed with the U.S.-made, M-16 assault rifle, an army spokesman said. The body was found on the Jordanian side of the border, he said. Although the army identified the attacker as a guerrilla, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> quoted an official source as suggesting the attacker was a Jordanian army soldier. `` An official source said today that at 6:30 a.m. the conscript <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, carrying his gun, abandoned his observation post at the border,'' the broadcast said. `` During search operations for the absent conscript, the sound of shooting was heard in the <LOCATION> Zor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abdullah </LOCATION> area northwest of <LOCATION> Waqqas </LOCATION> village,'' it said. Waqqas is close to the site of the clash as given by the Israeli army. The Jordanian official was quoted as saying <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> `` suffers from psychological trouble ... -LRB- and -RRB- is still absent.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio gave a different version of the clash, saying that an army scout was the first to open fire when he heard a noise on the other side of the border. It said the scout was wounded in the firefight. It was the third infiltration attempt or attack from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> since May 1988. `` We have an impression that this is not a new step or a new direction,'' Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, the head of the army's central command, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> in an interview from the site of the clash. `` We see that the Jordanians are making every effort and use all the means to keep this border secure and closed.'' In previous cases, <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> said, the guerrillas `` succeeded in sneaking by the Jordanian patrols. This case is still unclear. We do n't know who this man is, where he left from, who sent him and how he came here.'' `` We should remember that although <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is really trying to prevent such activity, there is no substitute to our own forces,'' <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> said.

 Syrian gunners shelled the Christian coastline north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today despite an appeal by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders for a cease-fire. A dozen 130mm howitzer shells fired by Syrian gunners from a battery in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> slammed into the coast near the Christian ports of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Byblos </PERSON>, a police spokesman said. No casualties were reported, he said. Arab leaders ended a summit in <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, on Friday without a blueprint for solving <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year civil war or the recent fighting between Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian troops and his Syrian-Druse foes. Fighting broke out again March 8 when <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops blockaded illegal Druse-run ports, and the Moslem alliance responded by shelling the 310-square-mile Christian enclave. Several cease-fires declared by the Arab League have failed. The Arab leaders were unable during their summit to reach an agreement on proposals to form an observer force for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Instead, they created a committee of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, Saudi monarch King Fahd and Algerian President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> to set up a workable cease-fire over the next six months. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, who attended the summit, reported a `` gentleman's agreement'' had been reached calling for <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to withdraw its 45,000 troops from <LOCATION> Leganon </LOCATION>, but there was no sign it would be honored. The committee also is to hammer out a new constitution for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads the Moslem cabinet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government, was quick to support the summit's resolutions. `` I welcome the resolutions of the Arab summit and hope they will be implemented as soon as possible,'' he said in a statement released Friday. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> cabinet, has not announced his position. But the Christian militia was apparently disappointed because the resolutions did not call openly for the withdrawal of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s troops. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of failing to adhere a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> by siding with the Moslems against the Christians in the civil war.

<HEAD>Back at Home, Grounded Red Square Pilot Turns Equestrian</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEDEL, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two years after his flight to Red Square triggered a Kremlin shake-up and drew a Soviet prison sentence, <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON>'s interests are more down to earth. He rides a horse. Back at home in this <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> suburb, life is nearly back to normal for the West German youth who thought his May 28, 1987 stunt would earn him a meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The crew cut he wore upon release from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Lefortovo Prison in August has grown back, as has the grass around his family's brick apartment house after repeated trampling by journalists and curiosity seekers But Rust, now 21, has had to change roles from aviator to equestrian, as local authorities refuse to reinstate his pilot's license `` I do n't like places where there are so many people on so little space,'' said Rust, seated primly in the tiny dining alcove cluttered with memorabilia from his moments in the limelight. `` That's why I bought my horse, to get away while I'm not able to fly.'' The 8-year-old black mare, <PERSON> Torina </PERSON>, is a champion jumper and was bought with money <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> magazine paid Rust's family for the rights to their story. The West German press labeled Rust `` the daredevil Kremlin flier'' when at the age of 19 he flew a single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> through heavily guarded air space and landed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Red Square. The act was a prelude to the ouster of Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Koldunov </PERSON>, because Soviet air defenses took no action to halt the flight. But despite self-confidence about his abilities as an aviator, Rust is no adventurer and an unlikely hero. His political rationale for making the flight has done more to perplex than impress those who initially took his flight as reckless derring-do. `` It was my direct goal to speak to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, to explain that our people also want better relations. It was impossible at that time in any other way, so I made the flight,'' Rust said. `` I do not regret the flight because in the end, this incident helped to better relations between East and West and to clarify the differences and similarities between our societies,'' the bespectacled youth contended. He expresses `` disappointment'' that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> never granted him an audience but harbors a hope of meeting him when he travels to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a tourist. He can not get a visa, however, until his four-year sentence expires in September 1991. Rust was convicted in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on charges of violating international air safety regulations, illegal entry into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and malicious hooliganism. He was released in August on what Soviet authorities said were humanitarian grounds. He initially faced charges in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but they were dropped late last year by the <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> state prosecutor's office. The sole sanction still in force is the revoked pilot's license. Rust expects to earn it back some day and fly for one of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>'s air charter services In the meantime, he is spending an idle summer at home with his parents, <PERSON> Monika </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karl-Heinz </PERSON>, and his 17-year-old brother <PERSON> Ingo </PERSON>. This fall he will enter the <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the pacifist alternative to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s compulsory military term. Rust says his experience in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where he claims to have befriended guards, prosecutors and <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents, solidified his opposition to any use of armed force. He will instead serve his 20-month term at a local hospital and get the training he needs to be a health care worker should the much hoped-for pilot's license not materialize. The family's crowded four-room home has been transformed into a shrine to Rust's crime. Photographs, newspaper clippings, artists' sketches and cartoons lampooning his unauthorized flight from <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> cover much of the wall space in the dining and living rooms, as well as over the bunk beds in what Mrs. Rust still calls `` the children's room. A poster of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has stared across the entrance way since the first of the family's seven trips to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to visit the jailed flier. Between rides on <PERSON> Torina </PERSON>, stabled at a farm four miles away, Rust says he is at work on a book and a screenplay that would explain his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> mission. The book, progressing slowly, is being penned by hand because Rust says computers and typewriters are `` intimidating and overrated.'' He claims <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> filmmakers have offered him as much as $ 500,000 for the movie rights to his story but that he has turned them down because they would not allow him to write the script. His mother claims part of the responsibility for her son's flight across heavily guarded Soviet territory, recalling how she would sometimes dream aloud of a Western gesture of peace to the new <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader `` But these were just illusions,'' she said. `` I had no idea he was planning such a thing.'' <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> contends the idea was his alone and that its roots will become clear in the book, which he hopes to release some time next year.

 Eleven drug traffickers were hanged in northwestern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Saturday, bringing the number of drug-related executions since January to 686, the official Iranian news agency reported. The 11 were convicted of heroin trafficking and hanged in <LOCATION> Tabriz </LOCATION>, 320 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, according to the agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. A total of 128 traffickers have been hanged in the past two weeks.

The government says 1 million of the 50 million population are involved in drug abuse, but unofficial figures put the number at twice that.

 A bridge collapsed minutes after an engineer recommended closing it, and the rain-swollen river below swept away at least two vehicles. Flooding elsewhere in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> left two people dead and hundreds out of their homes. Police could not say how many people were in the cars, which plunged into the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> when a bridge near <LOCATION> Miamitown </LOCATION> collapsed Friday evening. Rescuers resumed searching for victims this morning, but could not enter the flooding river because of its swift current. `` The car in front of us just dropped straight down,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Boebinger </PERSON>, who was waiting to cross the bridge when it started collapsing. `` I said, ` Oh my God.' I put it in reverse and backed up. I did n't feel the bridge shake at all. It just happened in an instant.'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffbauer </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office was asked if anyone could have survived the plunge. `` I would n't think so,'' he said. `` The current is moving pretty fast. I ca n't tell you how fast, but the rescue crews did n't go into the water at all.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said it got more than a dozen missing person calls, but <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, disaster services director, said none of the missing could be confirmed as river victims. Officials said divers likely would have to wait for the water to recede before going in. The collapse of the one-lane, temporary bridge carrying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 52 over the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Miamitown </LOCATION>, 10 miles west of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, occurred just 10 minutes after a <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> engineer had given an order to close the span. Widespread flooding in southwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> earlier Friday sent people scurrying to rooftops and high ground. A couple and their 10-year-old son were stranded on the roof of their house all day until rescuers reached them by boat, the <ORGANIZATION> Butler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, rescuers used lifelines and boats to lead 30 occupants of a trailer park through chest-high water to safety. A total of 200 people were forced from their homes in the town of about 1,900 people southwest of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>. Divers recovered the body of 20-month-old <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Donnels </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, the sheriff's department said The boy fell into the swollen creek from a footbridge near his grandmother's house. In Findlay in northwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hancock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies recovered the body of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Faust </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Fostoria </LOCATION>, from her overturned car in the <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The car was swept off a county road by high water, hit a metal bridge abutment and overturned into the river. At the site of the bridge collapse, witnesses gave varying accounts of two to four vehicles falling into the river, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Colerain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Radio station <ORGANIZATION> WCKY </ORGANIZATION> reported at least six people were missing. An adult and four children were seen in a yellow pickup truck and at least one person in a car which went under the water, the station said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brayshaw </PERSON>, the county's chief deputy engineer, had been advised by the contractor, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Strongsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, that the river was washing tree trunks and other heavy debris downstream. Engineers said the debris posed a threat to the steel beams driven into bedrock under the river that supported the 300-foot bridge. The temporary bridge had been in use for several months while a new bridge was being built to replace a 94-year-old span, <PERSON> Brayshaw </PERSON> said. Just as engineers were moving to barricade the bridge, a 100-foot section collapsed. Late Friday, three other bridges over the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> were closed.

<HEAD>Politics of Judicial Selection Heating Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The politics of judicial selection is heating up in legal and legislative circles, just as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prepares to begin filling 46 vacancies on the federal bench. The 16 to 18 candidates expected to be nominated in June will indicate whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to extend the conservative control of judicial appointments that began eight years ago. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a chance to consolidate the conservative trend in federal jurisprudence begun under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who appointed more than half of all federal judges currently sitting during his eight years in office. The expected nomination of <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a black conservative who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, would signal just such a trend. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> is expected to be nominated to fill a vacancy created on the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here by last year's resignation of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> _ a martyr of the conservative movement's battle for the federal judiciary. Conservatives are still seeing red over the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s 1987 vote defeating <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s nomination to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Resentment by conservatives over <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s defeat wo n't be hard to detect this week at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s judicial screening role. Conservatives criticized the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s judicial panel after four of its 15 members found <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> unqualified on the ground that his `` comparatively extreme views'' on constitutional principles would affect his judicial temperament. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> submitted five nominations to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but the candidates were chosen from the ranks of potential judges left over from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The final screening of the first crop of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own judicial nominees comes amid a dispute between Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> over the group's role in judicial screening and heightened concern about the issue on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> officials and representatives of other interest groups are scheduled to testify at Friday's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing. Conservatives and liberals alike have criticized the secret process by which the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> reviews judicial candidates and renders a rating of the individual's qualifications before a nominee is forwarded to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Conservatives accuse the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> of giving low marks to candidates because of their political views. Liberals like Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, are concerned about the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s practice of not divulging the basis for holding a candidate unqualified for the judiciary <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> was born of an apparent disagreement over discussions he and his aides had with bar officials over changes in the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s guidelines on judicial screening. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the attorney general's choice to be the No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, has become embroiled in the controversy. Conservative critics hold <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>, who chaired the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> from 1984 to 1987, responsible for what they regard as the panel's ideological and political bias against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointees to the courts. A month after <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> confidently told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> had agreed not to evaluate a candidate's political or ideological beliefs, the attorney general is still trying to resolve the issue The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> said it made no such agreement, denying it had ever considered politics or ideology in assessing a candidate's professional qualifications <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> threatened to cut the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> out of the judicial screening process unless it abided by the agreement he insisted he had obtained. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> then offered to drop a sentence from its guidelines stating that ideological and political beliefs are not examined except to the extent they may bear on other qualifications, notably judicial temperament. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, said this is an acceptable solution, but it might not satisfy conservative critics. `` I ca n't believe they are putting that forward as an honest proposal,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Deleting the sentence prohibiting consideration of political beliefs `` would give them carte blanche to do it because it's not expressly forbidden as it was before.'' The discussions between the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> are continuing to try to resolve one remaining obstacle to a joint statement. `` When you get more than one lawyer trying to get words down on a piece of paper, you find controversy over words,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. What appears to be still at stake is the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s insistence that it will not admit to ever having improperly having delved into a candidate's political beliefs. At a briefing last week, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> conceded that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> could not cite any examples of ideologically tainted <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> reviews. Signalling a slight retreat in the attorney general's position, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> `` has problems with the changes in the language -LRB- in <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> guidelines -RRB- that have led to perception problems with the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> on how they reviewed judicial candidates.''

 <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and its unions raced against the clock today in hopes of negotiating new contracts before existing pacts expire tonight, but a bitter dispute over medical benefits threatened to block a settlement. `` There's a lot to be done and a lot of hard bargaining going on,'' a company official said today shortly after the negotiators returned to the bargaining table. It remained unclear whether the two sides could resolve their differences over medical benefits, described by one source as `` the major block to a settlement.'' Also up in the air was whether the unions would immediately call a strike in the absence of a settlement. After a long and frantic day of negotiating Friday, both sides publicly continued to express hope of reaching new contracts before existing pacts affecting about 160,000 workers expire at 11:59 p.m. EDT. But they say such a development hinges on a major breakthrough on the benefits package, which has dominated the talks from the outset. `` If we can settle health care _ no easy task _ then we can reach agreement on wages and the other issues,'' a union source said late Friday. `` This is the major block to a settlement.'' Sources close to the negotiations said progress has been made but they cautioned that negotiations are at a fragile stage and could turn for the worse. In an arrangement likely to be repeated today, formal negotiating committees met Friday at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel while the two union presidents and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's top negotiator held separate meetings periodically on the major issues. It remained unclear as the deadline approached whether the unions would call a strike immediately if no agreement is reached. Union officials have refused to disclose their plans but have hinted strongly that they would not strike right away, particularly if agreement on a contract appeared near. Instead, the unions have a number of other strategies designed to pressure the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> into a settlement, primarily a nationwide labor boycott of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T long-distance service that the unions contend could cut the company's long-distance revenues by up to 8 percent. As two levels of negotiations continued late Friday, both sides reported progress but said bitter union opposition to <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s health care proposal remained a substantial barrier to a settlement. The unions, the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, vehemently oppose <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s demand that workers pay more up front for medical care. The company says it needs to reduce its $ 1 billion annual medical bill, but the unions have demanded expanded benefits while promising to devise new cost-control measures. Hectic negotiations Friday were marked by repeated exchanges of proposals and counter offers, including a significant <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T offer to limit the use of temporary workers _ a key union job-security demand. The sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T proposed in an informal meeting among top officials from both sides to revise its health care package. Neither side would discuss details. But a union official said, `` It was a reconfiguration of the existing offer and it is unacceptable.'' In addition to offering to regulate use of temporary workers, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> has amended and expanded its contract proposal to improve eye and dental care and its parental leave policy, company officials said. Also, it has proposed for the first time allowing leave for workers to care for sick relatives. Those proposals are in addition to the formal offer the company made Monday, a package which provided varying base wage increases and lump sum payments depending on job classification and also a new profit-sharing plan for union workers.

<HEAD>Nuclear Weapons Data Shared with France, Pentagon Confirms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> secretly has supplied <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with information about the design of nuclear weapons since 1972, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged, confirming a reported published Saturday. American officials previously acknowledged sharing nuclear weapons information only with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and `` U.S.-French nuclear collaboration has ... been one of the most closely guarded secrets of both governments,'' <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON> wrote in the quarterly Foreign Policy. The exchange of data means that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is more closely integrated than previously realized into the nuclear war plans of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, and the disclosure might complicate efforts to negotiate a deal to sharply reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet strategic arsenals. `` It may be that public acknowledgement of the program of aid to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and particularly of coordination between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> nuclear forces, would increase Soviet pressure for the inclusion of French and British forces in any future strategic arms control regime,'' wrote <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON>. The British nuclear arsenal, now being modernized, is slated to consist of 500 warheads by the mid-1990s, and the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> plan to have about 1,000 warheads by early in the next century. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> each have more than 11,000 strategic warheads, and under the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reduction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> would cut that number to 6,000 apiece. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of sharing nuclear weapons data with the French was initiated in 1972 by then President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and his national security adviser, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, as a means to draw the French more closely into <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, wrote <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> left <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s integrated military structure in 1966, although it remains within the alliance <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON> concluded `` in the course of more than 100 interviews over the past two years with top-level politicians, civil servants'' and others involved in the program that since 1972, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts have briefed their French counterparts on aspects of nuclear weaponry including: _ Penetration of Soviet defenses _ Miniaturization of warhead components to allow development of Multiple Independently Targeted Re-Entry Vehicles _ Guidance and propulsion systems, including the chemistry of solid fuels for rocket engines Moreover, the two sides have shared targeting information about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to ensure that the French and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear bombs do not interfere with one another, <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON> wrote. `` The assistance almost certainly has violated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law,'' <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON> wrote. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged some aspects of <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON>'s article, but denied that the data exchange was illegal and declined to discuss details. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` has cooperated with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in improving the operational effectiveness and survivability of its strategic missile systems, including supporting command and control systems,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, reading a statement he said had been cleared by the French government and the White House. `` There have been several meetings involving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French technicians every year since 1972 under the terms of the 1961 agreement'' on nuclear cooperation, said the spokesman, who spoke on condition that he not be further identified. That agreement was amended in 1985 to provide for the exchange of classified or `` restricted data ... The 1961 agreement provided the basis for the exchange of nuclear weapons information related to military operational requirements,'' said the spokesman. `` The amended agreement allows certain classified exchanges, focused on enhancing the safety, security, and reliability of nuclear activities and installations,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statement. The picture that emerged from <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON>'s article and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statement was of an information exchange that at first was heavily in favor of the French, but which in recent years has become more balanced. `` The <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> nuclear program has reached a technical maturity which approaches our own,'' the statement said. `` The <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> force contributes effectively to Western deterrence.'' `` Exchanges were aimed at improving our mutual understanding of technologies related to nuclear safety,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statement said. `` More recently we discussed measures to deal with nuclear weapons accidents. Exchanges facilitated efforts from both sides to make their nuclear weapons safe.'' `` The transfer of nuclear weapons, nuclear components of weapons, source or special nuclear material is not authorized by this agreement,'' he said. As required by law, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION> and senior congressional leaders were informed of the 1985 amendment to the 1961 agreement, and the exchange of information was fully legal, the statement said. The amendment did not require <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification, it said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was in recess over the Memorial Day weekend and it was impossible to determine the extent of congressional knowledge of the nuclear data exchange. Senior congressional aides said they were unaware of details of the agreement, but that it might have been so secret that they were not informed. <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON> wrote that the 1985 amendment `` seems to have gone unnoticed by anyone outside the nuclear weapons establishments of both countries.''

 Anti-NATO protesters clashed with riot police Saturday while a flotilla of allied warships passed by during celebrations of Armed Forces Day. Crews of the 29 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> warships saluted King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON>, who reviewed the flotilla from the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> navy frigate <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>. On shore, protesters threw rocks at guards, knocked down security barriers and overturned garbage containers, police said. Some protesters tried to set fire to cars, they said. Riot police dispersed the group with truncheons, and some protesters were slightly injured, police said. No arrests were reported. Earlier, several hundred demonstrators peacefully linked arms in the port area to protest the naval review. Protesters are demanding that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> withdraw from the 16-member <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and that the ships leave <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION>. The Spanish chapter of <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> has said some of the ships are equipped to carry nuclear weapons.

 Thousands of riot police blocked a protest rally Saturday by dissidents calling for the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and the expulsion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. Police arrested more than 500 people. The government deployed about 7,000 troops in a major show of strength. Hundreds of police in combat fatigues with shields blocked off the park where the rally was to be held. Other officers blanketed the city center. Dissidents and radical students staged scattered, peaceful protests in the downtown area after the rally was blocked. Bands of students attempted to march in some downtown areas, but were quickly dispersed and some students were dragged away. Small peaceful protests were reported in the provincial cities of <LOCATION> Taegju </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chonju </LOCATION>, and about 10,000 people marched in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, according to Korean press reports. About 300 radical students were in the second day of a hunger strike at the <ORGANIZATION> Myongdong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> cathedral in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. They are demanding the fall of the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government and a government admission that police killed a radical student. Riot police ringed the cathedral but did not move in. Some of the hunger strikers wrote anti-government slogans with their blood drawn by biting their fingers as other protesters applauded. `` Down with the dictatorship,'' the hungers strikers chanted. The protesters said they were inspired by a hunger strike held by students demanding political reforms in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. About 500 students were blocked by riot police when they attempted to march out of <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in western <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Students pushed and hit police with sticks but were unable to get past lines of troopers with interlocked shields. `` Bury <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' students shouted. `` Drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>!'' It was the second Saturday in a row that the government blocked a protest in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Few people responded to the dissidents' call to take part in the protests, despite widespread appeals. Dissidents and radical students have little public support because of their violent tactics and extremist views. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the main dissident alliance which called for protests in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and 10 other cities, had predicted up to 100,000 people would demonstrate nationwide. It called the rally to denounce the government and demand a full investigation into the death of radical student <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol-kyu </PERSON>. The alliance had said its protests would be peaceful because of public anger over past violent demonstrations. Dissidents claim police tortured and killed <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, whose body was found in a reservoir May 10 near the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. The government says police chased <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> after stopping him at a roadblock but deny any official involvement in the death. The government says an autopsy shows <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> drowned and officials speculate he fell into the reservoir. In addition to the fall of the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government, dissidents are demanding the removal of the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a defense pact.

 Residents of this affluent community, shaken by the arrests of five high school students on charges of sexually assaulting a mentally retarded girl, have raised another disturbing question. Why did it take weeks for authorities to bring charges in the case when students in the high school were buzzing about the incident the day after it occurred? Authorities say it just took that long to investigate, while others charge it was a sign of the popularity and privileged status of the suspects. `` Everybody has known about it for a while,'' said a student who would give her name only as <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>. Police say that on March 1, 13 teen-agers accompanied a 17-year-old mentally retarded girl to the home of two of the teens, where she was sexually assaulted with a broomstick and a miniature baseball bat. No sexual intercourse took place. The girl, who was an acquaintance of the boys, is not capable of understanding or consenting to what happened, authorities said. Five teens, all 17 or 18, were arrested Wednesday, the day after a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> television station broadcast a report on the incident. Three were charged as adults with conspiracy and assault charges, two were charged as juveniles. The other eight, who were not charged, watched the incident but did not intervene, investigators said. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pignatello </PERSON>, a lifelong resident, said: `` This does n't happen in <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> I know those kids. I know every family in town. These kids are well educated. They know right from wrong. They're not on drugs or alcohol. `` I just ca n't understand how anything like this could happen.'' Some residents are angry that the March 1 incident is being compared to the case from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 20 miles to the east, in which a Central Park jogger was raped by a gang of teen-age boys. `` Because of the proximity and time of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ` wilding' incidents, analogies are made of rich white boys vs. poor black youths in the city,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigby </PERSON>, an attorney for one of the teen-agers charged `` You've got two very distinct incidents here and it's not fair to make comparisons.'' Some students and residents say the delay in the arrests may be due to the popularity of the students, many of whom are athletes. They also note that among the eight who witnessed the incident but was not charged is a township police lieutenant's son. <PERSON> Missy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheuermann </PERSON>, a township resident, said she suspected a coverup by authorities to protect a group of privileged students. `` It's appalling. ... No one's ever going to hear the truth,'' she said. Students said rumors began circulating the day after the incident and it was known throughout the 340-student school by the time of the arrest. `` Everybody knew about it,'' said one junior, who said he did n't want his name used for fear of reprisals. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor's office, said the length of the investigation was justified by the factors involved _ the mental state of the victim and the number of boys involved. `` It is the normal course that a complex investigation takes,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. `` You do it as thoroughly as you can until you're satisfied you've gone as far as you can. The girl first reported the incident March 4 to a teacher at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where she attends special education classes. The delay by a victim in reporting the attack is common in sexual abuse cases, said Dr. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>, coordinator of a <ORGANIZATION> Morristown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> program that cares for victims of violent assaults. `` I think victims in general, children or adults, fear of what would happen if they do reveal an attack,'' <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> said. `` Also there is the fear, will people believe them?'' Police were notified about three weeks later. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> superintendent of schools, said school officials wanted to be sure of the nature of the incident before calling in police. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> school officials heard about the incident from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> officials and from a student. `` There was certainly no cover-up on our behalf,'' <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> said. `` We can not answer why it took them that long to investigate. They shared no information with us.''

<HEAD>Income Tax Hike Urged by Economist to Close Budget Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Enough talk about `` flexible freezes,'' `` sin taxes'' and `` revenue enhancement'' to cut the federal budget deficit, says economist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON>. The real solution to the budget problem, insists <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON>, an authority on public finance, is the old-fashioned one: an increase in the individual income tax. And he wants more than higher rates that hit the wealthy _ he is calling for restricting the mortgage interest deduction and for repealing the writeoff for charitable contributions. `` We can not resolve the federal budget crisis without raising taxes,'' <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON>, author of `` The Theory of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>,'' said in a report issued Saturday. `` There is not enough scope for responsible program cuts while paying for the savings-and-loan bailout and beginning to address the growing backlog of unmet needs in education, child care, the environment and public infrastructure,'' he wrote. `` Increased revenue is needed and should be drawn from the personal income tax,'' <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON> said in a report released by the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a research group financed by labor, business and foundations. <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON> is a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> professor-emeritus. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agree there will be no general tax increase to reduce the deficit during the budget year that begins Oct. 1. The president prefers a `` flexible freeze'' on spending _ <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would not go along _ and such `` revenue enhancements'' as extending the expiring tax on telephone service and blocking a scheduled decline in taxes on air tickets and shipments. It remains to be seen whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a year from now will abandon his campaign promise against any tax increase. While there is a widespread feeling in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that higher taxes will have to be enacted by Oct. 1, 1990, few lawmakers are calling for major changes in the massive 1986 tax overhaul. <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON> is. `` The proposition that the income tax ` must not be touched' because it has been the subject of recent reform has political appeal but little substance,'' <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON> wrote `` On the contrary: The need to provide for additional revenue and to do so promptly should make use of the improved tax, rather than worsen the tax system by resorting to inferior revenue sources or the addition of a new and complex tax.'' Raising excise taxes _ the `` sin taxes'' that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> talks about _ would be unfair to lower-income Americans and provide insufficient revenue for deficit reductions, <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON> says. Imposing a national sales tax, known as a value-added tax, would discriminate against larger families, require a new bureaucracy to administer and preempt a traditional state revenue source, he adds. The individual income tax, which already provides 40 percent of federal revenues, `` remains superior to other proven taxes and preferable to most alternatives which have been proposed,'' <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON> says. The income tax is highly visible, `` a steady reminder of the quality of public service that should be provided in return,'' the report argues. It permits tax liabilities to be adjusted to the taxpayer's ability to pay and to family size. And, since the 1986 overhaul, the income tax has people with similar incomes paying similar taxes. But the new law can be improved, making it fairer and providing sizable revenue to reduce the deficit, <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON> contends. His proposals, which could wipe out the deficit in one year: _ Raise the 33-percent top individual tax bracket, which affects upper-income taxpayers, to 40 percent and impose a new set of graduated rates that would hit some middle-income families _ Limit the amount of home mortgage interest that can be deducted _ Repeal the deduction for charitable contributions _ Tax interest on state and local bonds _ Tax a portion of the money contributed to pensions, health insurance and other employer-financed benefits _ Impose capital-gains taxes at death on the increase in value of property during the owner's lifetime

 As so often in its recent history, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is in a convulsion, seemingly unable to escape the pattern of using force or the threat of it to settle political differences and achieve change. Once again, as in the violent 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, the leaders and masses caught up in the struggle seem oblivious to the possible damage to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s careful advances in economic reform. This time, however, the issues are clearer than in the far-leftist Cultural Revolution, when a power struggle was cloaked in ideology. At stake now is whether the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will continue to determine <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s future, or whether it will allow students or any other group a small voice. Although other demands were raised during six weeks of student protests that climaxed in a top-level power struggle, the students' key demand is for a meeting, on equal terms, at which specific reforms such as a free press can be discussed Reformist party chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> endorsed a dialogue, and for a brief time student leaders believed he was winning a power struggle with hardliners. Some hoped that under him, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> might take its first major step away from a 2,000-year-old tradition of autocracy. But by last week's end, it was clear that hardliners under senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> were in charge. Fears of violent conflict between protesters and soldiers _ and among military units on opposing sides of the power struggle _ subsided as soldiers ordered by <PERSON> Li </PERSON> to enforce martial law moved to the outskirts of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> seemed willing to wait before trying to enforce the martial law that so far has existed in name only. Street marches waned and barely 10,000 students continued a sit-in at Tiananmen Square that began May 13 and peaked with 200,000 participants. However, students and workers said they would hold new mass marches this week. But even if the movement dies, it will only be a matter of time before <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is challenged again by the same clamor for democracy from students, intellectuals, workers and others whose non-material aspirations the party has ignored for 40 years. Their voice has gained strength with each round of protests. In 1978, hundreds of students and workers put posters on a wall in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> calling for reform. In 1986, students marched several hundred thousand strong. This month, more than 1 million students, workers, teachers, doctors, police, government workers, party members and soldiers joined the chorus. Little popular respect remains for leaders who have been seen as ready to go to any extreme to protect their power. Even children joined the mocking chant, `` Xiaoping, your mind is not sharp.'' <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents will not forget soon the heady sense of power it gave them. During the height of the protests, many careened down streets in flat-bed trucks, whooping and waving flags. They hung <PERSON> Li </PERSON> in effigy and satirized <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. It was a mass catharsis for citizens of one of the world's most tightly controlled societies. Even the army lost prestige. `` Something has snapped in the entire political system,'' said a Western diplomat. `` It's impossible to put it back together again the way it was.'' Some players may be off the stage for good. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was reported under house arrest, several other top officials were reported in serious trouble and a purge of liberals in the party, academia and the media was predicted. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said most of the student protesters will be regarded as patriots but that `` a tiny minority'' of student leaders conspired to overthrow the party and will be punished. They can expect to go the way of <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingsheng </PERSON>, the last impetuous youth who dared take <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s name in vain in public. <PERSON> Wei </PERSON>, a 29-year-old electrician, helped lead the 1978 Democracy Wall movement and is serving a 15-year prison term. Semi-retired conservative <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>, 84, in a televised speech blamed the student protests on `` a relaxation in Marxist ideological education,'' indicating the nation may face a strident anti-Western, anti-liberal political campaign like the one that followed the 1986-87 student protests. For a time, at least, writers and artists who had been enjoying a gradual relaxation of censorship will have to feel their way carefully. Pressures for economic conservativism also will increase. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> sponsored a 10-year-old reform program that stimulated the economy by reducing central planning and introducing elements of the free market. But the reforms have been stalled since September while the government tries to end supply bottlenecks, corruption and more than 30-percent inflation. Liberal economists prescribed faster dismantling of the old system. In order to defeat <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, however, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was forced to seek support from aging revolutionaries such as <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, who may insist on moving slowly and even re-asserting some controls. The government also may have scared off some foreign investment by its harsh response to the protests, which negated the image it had carefully cultived of a united, rational leadership. Ripples will be felt in the British colony of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, from which thousands of professionals already have fled in anticipation of the return to Chinese rule in 1997. The crackdown will only encourage further exodus. In the end, the huge masses of protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and other cities seemed irrelevant to the power struggle itself, the outcome of which was determined by the allegiances of military commanders and votes in the party Politburo. Without mass support, however, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s rule will be shaky. Furthermore, he and the party elders who rallied to him can not live forever. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is known to suffer from minor illnesses and his public statements have become rambling. He or a successor will be forced eventually to respond to the masses: to students galvanized by the writings of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON> and other Western individualists, to workers who see inflation erode their buying power while corrupt officials get fat, and to peasants who are angry at being forced to grow grain and accept IOUs from the government. All have a common yearning: to share in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s prosperity. Beyond that, most want democracy in the simple terms of being able to choose their leaders, perceiving the current lot as confused and ineffectual. They want newspapers that are believable, free of political controls. Very few have said they want to replace the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but a growing number of students and others wonder if their goals can be achieved under a one-party system. They may face arrest, but most of the student activists are determined to continue agitating for reform as long as they can despite the fall or rise of top leaders. `` Democracy and freedom and science ca n't be accomplished in one or two years,'' said <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhangbao </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` We want to go forward step by step ... And hope that future students will join in.''

 Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, No. 3 in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership, said today he will quit <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rather than endure a protracted ethics investigation similar to the one that has driven Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to the brink of resignation. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the majority whip in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, has come under fire in recent weeks for a $ 100,000 junk bond investment in which he earned more than $ 6,000 without investing any money, and for other financial dealings. In a statement, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said his ability to work in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and serve the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` has been diminished by needless and baseless charges about my investments or private life. I have simply spent too much time building the party and trying to help people to have my attention or abilities devoted to such distractions.'' `` Accordingly, I will not seek the office of majority leader. Instead, I will tender my resignation as majority whip, and will also resign my seat in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ on my -LRB- 47th -RRB- birthday _ June 15th,'' he said. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> congressman said that `` all week, my colleagues have expressed their confidence in me and their support for a leader's race. I would have preferred to land in that race with both feet, and would have had the votes to win. `` Moreover, my attorneys remain convinced that a normal business transaction, admittedly marred by reporting errors, posed no legal problems for me, and I accept their advice,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said. He added: `` Undoubtedly, some will think this decision was motivated by weakness in my political standing or my legal position. They are entitled to their opinions, but they are wrong.'' House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., termed <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s departure as `` a loss,'' adding: `` In the current environment, realistically, there might be a long period of inquiry which he feels would be damaging to the party or to the House for which he has deep affection With <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> out of the leadership scramble, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., has decided to run for majority leader `` no matter what,'' a congressional source close to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said today on condition of anonymity `` He has been persuaded to run,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> source said today. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> learned of <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s planned resignation through news accounts Friday night and was in his congressional office today calling colleagues to seek their support for his leadership bid. According to the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> source, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman has decided to `` unequivocally'' abandon any presidential plans for 1992 if he wins the majority leader position. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988. <PERSON> Gephard </PERSON> said in a statement he was `` stunned and saddened by <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>'s decision. `` He has been an extraordinarily able and effective leader in the House. He has also been my good friend, and he will continue to be,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. A top Democratic leadership source, who spoke only on condition he not be named, said <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> `` just said he could n't be an effective majority leader with these charges out there.'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s decision, first disclosed in an interview published in today's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, further complicates Democratic efforts to regroup in the wake of the furor over <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s ethical problems. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> is expected to become speaker if <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigns as expected next week. Earlier Friday, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> had been passing word that he would attempt to move up to majority leader, but his decision to depart leaves open the posts of majority leader, whip and possibly several other leadership posts. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> told the Times he was taking the actions to avoid a protracted investigation of his personal finances. `` I want to give my party a chance to move on,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. `` I do n't intend to put my party through more turmoil. I do n't intend to put this institution through more turmoil. And more importantly, I do n't intend to put my family through more turmoil.'' `` If I ca n't be leader and if I ca n't be whip, it's time to try a new and different challenge,'' he said. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> acknowledged that a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings and loan executive set him up in a junk bond investment that netted him a $ 6,882 profit without him having to put up any of his own money. However, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> had said that except for some reporting errors the 1986 deal was `` totally above board'' and he did nothing wrong. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> has been a rising star in the House. The Californian was widely respected and liked by other Democrats for his work as chairman of the party's campaign committee, which raised funds and provided campaign services for the party's candidates. But some Democrats expressed concern privately over the possible political damage to the party if <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> took on a more prominent role at a time when his business dealings were coming under close scrutiny on the heels of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s apparently unsuccessful campaign to fend off multiple ethics allegations. A report released by <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> on May 14 showed that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assn </ORGANIZATION>. of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, purchased $ 100,000 in bonds for <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> and held them until <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> could raise money to pay for them. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> also provided half of the money to finance the bonds. The bond was sold to <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> by the executive a month later at the initial offering price, saving <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> about $ 4,000 compared to the bond's market price at the time. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported this week that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was opening a criminal investigation of whether <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> received favored treatment, but <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said the story was wrong. However, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> acknowledged that he regretted the deal. He put his personal funds into a blind trust last year, and he said he wished he had done it earlier. According to <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s report, he first considered investing his 1986 campaign funds in 12 -LCB- percent bonds, based on a suggestion by <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> ruled out that type of investment for his campaign, but <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> suggested the congressman himself could make an investment in the bonds. In the report earlier this month, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, concluded that <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>'s role in the transaction could not be considered a `` gift'' which would violate <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, because <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> paid him interest.

 Troops on Saturday shot and killed a guerrilla who opened fire from across the <LOCATION> Jordan-Israel </LOCATION> border and wounded two soldiers, the army command said. The attack occurred in a bushy area near the communal settlement of <LOCATION> Hamadiya </LOCATION>, 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the military command said. An army patrol, `` encountered light weapons fire from east of the fence'' between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, and returned fire, the command said. Soldiers searched the area on the Jordanian side of the border and found the body of a guerrilla dressed in a military-type uniform and armed with a U.S.-made M-16 assault rifle, an army spokesman said. But in an official broadcast, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said the man may have been a <ORGANIZATION> Jordanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldier, <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, who earlier disappeared from a border observation post. It was the third infiltration or attack from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> since May 1988. `` We have the impression that this is not a new step or a new direction,'' Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, the head of the Israeli army's central command, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> `` We see that the Jordanians are making every effort and use all means to keep this border secure and closed.'' In previous cases, <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> said, guerrillas sneaked by Jordanian patrols. `` This case is still unclear. We do n't know who this man is, where he left from, who sent him and how he came here.'' The last raid across the Jordanian border was on March 17 when two guerrillas ambushed an Israeli frontier patrol, killing one soldier and wounding another before escaping back to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> group, a Syrian-backed faction of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> led by Col. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>, claimed responsibility for the attack. Three Arab guerrillas infiltrated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> on May 17, 1988, and one was killed in a firefight with Israeli troops. The others escaped.

<HEAD>Brothers Say They Never Planned Voodoo Hex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT NAYLOR Jr.</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TUPELO, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Voodoo murder is usually the stuff of paperback novels and B-grade movies, but it's shaping up as the fare of a real-life court battle for two men accused of trying to use a hex to kill a judge. `` They are ridiculous charges,'' insists <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, charged along with his half-brother, <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivy </PERSON>, with conspiracy to commit murder. Prosecutors arrested Ivy on Oct. 14, 1988, minutes after he paid $ 100 for a faded photograph of Circuit Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> had sentenced <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 25, to 40 years in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> on an armed robbery charge, a sentence that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was serving at the time of the alleged plot. Authorities claim the brothers intended to send the picture and what was supposed to be a lock of <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>'s hair _ both purchased from undercover agents _ to a <LOCATION> Jamaican </LOCATION> voodoo priest who would cast a death curse on the judge. The brothers, who have the same mother but different fathers, have been jailed in <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION> awaiting trial on the charges, unable to post $ 50,000 bonds. If convicted, they could face sentences of up to 20 years in prison and fines of up to $ 500,000 each. Their trial, originally scheduled to begin Friday, has been delayed because it was assigned to <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. A new judge is to be appointed. In the meantime, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and Ivy, who spoke during separate prison interviews, said they are growing weary of the wait and sick of the attention their case has drawn. `` I'm tired of this. I want to know what's going on,'' said the 33-year-old Ivy. `` They've already ruined my life with all these allegations.'' `` What makes this so interesting?'' asked <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, his lanky body thrown into a molded plastic chair in a jail corridor. Prosecutors will say little about the case. `` I ca n't comment on the evidence or our trial plans,'' said Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> <PERSON> Geddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Prosecutors are expected, however, to argue that it makes no difference if the intended murder weapon was supernatural so long as the brothers intended to kill <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. The defense is expected to argue that the judge's life was never in danger. At the center of the case is the brothers' alleged belief in voodoo, which Ivy flatly denies and <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> will not directly discuss. `` Voodoo is a religion and I should n't comment on other people's beliefs,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said `` A lot of people have made a joke out of this. You should n't make a joke out of something you do n't know anything about.'' The brothers say they have n't seen each other while they've been in the Lee County Jail. `` I ai n't seen my brother in eight months. He's right down there,'' Ivy said, gesturing toward one of two wings. I sure would like to go down there and holler at him. But I know that would be wrong and I'm not fixing to do nothing wrong.'' He did not, he insists, do anything wrong when he purchased the picture of <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> from one of the judge's employees. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> takes the same position. `` Nobody can say that I told anybody that I was going to murder anybody,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` Nobody can say that I told anybody that I was going to practice voodoo. Where did that idea come from?'' What, then, did <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> intend to do with the photo? `` If I told you, who would believe me?'' he replied. Pressed on the subject, he finally said he planned to put the picture on a punching bag he used for boxing at the prison. `` That was all I could do with it,'' he said. Ivy said he and his brother are being railroaded because they are black. `` I live in the South and these white folks do n't allow no black man to do nothing,'' he said. `` The justice system is not set up for a black man. If a black man goes to court, nine times out of 10 he's going to be found guilty.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he is eager to go to trial. `` I'm glad this case is going to trial,'' he said. `` Maybe the public will get a chance to see how the justice system is really run in <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.''

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> first fell in love with Yosemite when he was 10 years old and his mother took him to the park as a reward for recovering from a slight case of polio, the actor and outdoorsman said. `` I was quite sick,'' <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Friday. `` I grew up in a poor neighborhood in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and never had an opportunity to get into the outdoors.'' <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, who is narrating a documentary about the park called, `` Yosemite: The Fate of Heaven,'' said he and his mother drove about eight hours through the redwoods and into a tunnel entering Yosemite National Park. `` We came out the other end, and what I saw absolutely put me away,'' he said.

 The newest pizza outlet in the state wo n't promise delivery within 30 minutes, but the owners have an excuse _ their new shop is a boat The 32-foot `` Pizza Tug O'' is due to make its maiden voyage Tuesday. It will ply the waters of southeastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where almost every town is on its own island and pizza delivery was out of the question until <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallmadge </PERSON> decided that where there's a wave there's a way. The Tallmadges, who came to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> on their honeymoon seven years ago and never went back, opened the first Domino's Pizza franchise in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> in February 1987 and a second shop six months later. Their third shop, the $ 125,000, custom-made boat, has a top speed of 14 miles and 17 pizzas an hour. The onboard kitchen has been specially designed to meet regulations for safe food handling in restaurants. The boat will make weekly voyages from <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>, population 28,000, to the smaller communities of <LOCATION> Haines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hoonah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Angoon </PERSON>. It also will drop anchor near commercial fishing grounds.

I think mostly they wanted to protect me. But I was persistent and finally they approved it.'' Domino's claims to be the world's largest pizza delivery company with more than 5,000 stores.

 Most sixth-graders work on science projects, but few receive the results 11 years later from 250 miles away. <PERSON> Barb </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, formerly of <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, was 12 years old in March 1978 when she put a note into a baby food jar, sealed it with black tape and threw the jar into the <LOCATION> Elkhorn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The note included instructions to contact her if the jar was found as part of her sixth-grade science project. Over the years, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> grew up, married and moved to <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. But the jar apparently continued its slow journey down the <LOCATION> Elkhorn </LOCATION>, into the <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and finally the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the heads of the 15 other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations meet this week to mark the alliance's 40th anniversary and set a course for future dealings with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s unpredictable and popular leader, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` The East is turning toward the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and is opening up,'' said <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will not miss the opportunity.'' A dispute over <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s short-range nuclear missiles threatened to undermine the show of unity, but <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said, `` Let me make it very clear that this summit is not a missile summit.'' <PERSON> Jaap </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoop </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheffer </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>' ambassador to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, said the allies need to agree on an overall strategy. They can not pursue `` completely independent Eastern policies. They have to do that in close contact and coordination,'' he said. But the strategy will likely contain few initiatives that will grab public attention in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as have <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s peacemaking promises of major cuts in arms, troops and defense spending <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in keeping with his cautious approach toward the Soviets, is weighing more moderate moves including a smaller <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop reduction in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and a possible end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions against the Soviets. While less sweeping than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposals, such moves would be likely to gain support in a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> hopeful for less combative East-West relations `` I would not exclude the possibility that there will be some new ideas,'' said <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Keel </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged, `` It's hard to match <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'' in the public imagination, especially in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> where his proposals have won him wide popularity. The first of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders began arriving in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Saturday, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to follow late Sunday after his visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Prime Ministers <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, the latter accompanied by his much-photographed mistress <PERSON> Dimitra </PERSON> <PERSON> Liana </PERSON>, were among those arriving early for the two-day summit. Preparations leading up to the summit were dominated by the dispute between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over the future role of short-range nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> would like to enter into early negotiations with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact over reducing those weapons, most of which are in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> argue the alliance should focus its attention on cutting the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>'s superiority in conventional, or non-nuclear, weapons. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> contends it needs a nuclear arsenal as a deterrent to balance the East's enormous stockpile of conventional arms. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed last week to accept the principle of eventual talks on tactical nuclear arms but only with strict conditions. American and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials worry that entering into the negotiations would inevitably lead to a `` third zero'' _ the removal of all those forces from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> declared in a radio interview on the eve of the summit that `` if you reduce those -LRB- missiles -RRB-, you're going for the jugular of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>.'' A West German official, meanwhile, offered an assurance of cooperation. `` We must not give the impression that the Germans alone know the recipe for the future of Western policies,'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. But West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on Saturday ruled out postponing superpower talks on short-range nuclear weapons `` into the distant future'' as a possible compromise in the dispute. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said that despite the missile dispute, the overall shape of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> policy is likely to remain the same. The summit will culminate Tuesday with the release of a document expected to reaffirm longstanding <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> positions. The main section of the document is tentatively called, `` Overcoming the Division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said a senior <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. A key point, he said, will be: `` The alliance reaffirms that it will and must reintensify its own efforts to overcome the division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and to explore all available avenues of cooperation and dialogue with the East.'' The document will refer to the efforts by 35 nations to improve personal freedoms and human rights and open up military matters in an effort to reduce tensions among the East and the West. It will challenge the East to make further progress. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also was expected to discuss his recent `` Open Skies'' proposal. The plan, expanding on an initiative by President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, calls for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> to permit unarmed aerial surveillance flights over their territory. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official said the political document will spell out an `` action agenda'' of eight to 10 points for expanding East-West contacts and cooperation. The aim, he said, is to support and encourage `` those reforms which go our way _ which enhance pluralism and allow democratic structures to unfold better.'' The document will also discuss relations among the Western nations, including `` burden-sharing,'' a shorthand term for the sticky question of whether the Europeans are paying enough for their own defense and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> too much. A resolution of the dispute would show up in the Comprehensive Concept, a blueprint for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> planning on arms control and force structures. The document is nearly complete except for wording on the divisive issue. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members are: <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> and his family are refugees from a disaster they were told would never happen. They had been assured by officials that a devastating train wreck in their modest suburban neighborhood on May 12 posed no risk to a 14-inch gasoline pipeline buried near the tracks. The pipe had been inspected. The trains would roll again. Everything was safe. Then, Thursday morning, as <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> took a morning walk, the familiar rumble of a freight train was followed by an unusual sight: a geyser of gasoline spraying dozens of feet into the air. Suddenly, a thunderous explosion rocked the neighborhood and flames engulfed everything. <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> woke his wife and two sons, ages 6 and 12, and tried to get to his truck in the garage, but the flames beat them back. They blindly ran into the street and sprinted to safety several blocks away. The blast killed two people, injured 31 and destroyed 10 homes. It was less than two weeks after a runaway train plowed through homes across the street, killing four people. Among the burned homes was the one rented by the <ORGANIZATION> Brewsters </ORGANIZATION>. `` All I've got left is a set of keys that do n't go to anything,'' <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> said. He is not alone in his loss, nor in his bitterness and fear. The disasters have sent waves of anger, apprehension and uncertainty through this blue-collar neighborhood of modern, ranch-style homes, many of them only a few feet away from the train tracks. Counselors who were summoned to the neighborhood found adults and children alike who spoke as if they had just left a combat zone. Mental health workers said they expect many people to suffer the same long-term problems that afflict war veterans. And everywhere _ in hospitals, rescue shelters and hotel rooms _ people expressed a strong fear of returning to the old neighborhood, certain that any assurances that the area is safe are nothing but lies. `` They do n't want to come back. Nobody wants to come back,'' said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Councilwoman <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope-Ludlam </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cita </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 18, was sleeping Thursday morning when she felt the rumble of what she assumed was a passing train, a sensation that still jangled nerves among those who lived by the tracks. This time, she rolled over to go back to sleep, but was pulled out of her slumber again by the shouts of her neighbor. `` It felt like an earthquake,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who leaped for the door. `` The whole neighborhood was orange and red. That's all I saw. I just went outside and ran. I ran north. I just kept running.'' Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was unharmed and her home escaped damage, but like many people, she does n't want to go back to a neighborhood she hardly recognizes anymore. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON>, in the heart of the damaged area, resembles an eerie black moonscape covered with gutted cars, charred trees, blackened telephone poles and the skeletons of homes. At one house, all that remains of a garage is a small piece of wood holding a padlock; at another home, what once was a swimming pool is now a black pit. `` When the train fell off the track, I was there by myself,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` When the explosion happened, I was there by myself. And now I'm afraid to be by myself.'' Counselors who have spoken to dozens of residents said Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s feelings are common. The train derailment alone had frightened many people out of returning to the neighborhood, and many were skeptical of official assurances that the pipeline near the tracks would not be threatened by the resumption of rail traffic. About 100 residents even hired an attorney who says he found evidence that the area was unsafe. With the second disaster, the fear of going home is overwhelming for many people, said clinical psychologist <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Haire </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic nun who met many residents at an evacuation center. Mental health workers are paying special attention to children. At <ORGANIZATION> Muscoy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, a memorial service for two students killed in the train derailment was postponed Friday. Counselors came to classrooms, asking students to write down their feelings and share their thoughts with friends and family. `` The trauma will stay with people for some time,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> psychologist <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` Especially with the children, it may pop up later down the line. They could be skittish about an earthquake, or any other thing like that. It could even pop up in some nervousness in relationships. `` It really is post traumatic stress syndrome, the same thing you hear about all the time with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans.'' For some, the anger and bitterness have overwhelmed any ties they may feel to the neighborhood. `` All these people were saying it was safe to go back after the train accident,'' <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> said. `` Now the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> says it's got another place for me a few blocks away. I said, ` Uh-uh. No way. We're never going back.'''

The Basque daily <ORGANIZATION> Egin </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> sent it a statement also claiming responsibility for the bombing of a car dealership in <LOCATION> Bilbao </LOCATION>. That blast occurred Wednesday, shortly before the car bomb, and apparently was designed to lure police to the site. The car bomb was left in a stolen vehicle parked near the dealership. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> seeks independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for the three-province northern Basque region. In its 21-year campaign of violence, <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> has claimed responsiblity for killing more than 600 people, mainly police, military and Civil Guard officers. The seven <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> killings this year have occurred since April 4, when the group broke off three months of peace talks with <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> officials and ended a moratorium on attacks on government targets.

 Archaeologists have unearthed the gold-stuffed tomb of two women in what appears to be the richest discovery ever made at ancient <LOCATION> Nimrud </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The 2,700-year-old tomb in the palace of King Ashurnasirpal II contained more than 55 pounds of gold jewelery including diadems, necklaces, earrings, belts and anklets, the English-language <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> Observer reported Friday. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, carried details of the newspaper report. <ORGANIZATION> Nimrud </ORGANIZATION>, a sprawling site 250 miles north of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, was a major city of the Assyrian empire that extended from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> in the first millennium B.C. Ashurnasirpal II was a ruthless but brilliant military leader who built the vast palace at <LOCATION> Nimrud </LOCATION> in the 9th century B.C. Scores of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> and foreign archaeological teams have dug at <ORGANIZATION> Nimrud </ORGANIZATION> in a century-and-a-half of excavations since British explorer <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Layard </PERSON> uncovered huge stone sculptures and inscriptions there in the 1840s. The explorers included British archaeologist <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallowan </PERSON>, the husband of author <PERSON> Agatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, who excavated close to the newly found tomb between 1949 and 1958. Some of <PERSON> Layard </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Mallowan </PERSON>'s finds are displayed in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, as well as in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s national museum in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Muzahem </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> archaeologist who made the new discovery, said an inscribed stone tablet found in the 32-by-14-foot burial chamber identified one of the women as Yabaya of the Assyrian royal court, the newspaper reported. The inscription in wedge-shaped cuneiform script also placed a curse on anyone who opened the tomb. `` If anyone lays his hands on my tomb, or opens my grave, or steals my jewelery, I pray to the gods of the nether world that his soul shall roam in the scorching sun after death ... Let the ghost of insomnia take hold of him for ever and ever,'' it said. The other woman was identified only as a much younger person named <PERSON> Taliya </PERSON>, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Yabaya </PERSON>'s possessions included gold needles, a bronze mirror with its enamel handle encrusted with precious stones, and tiny tongs for applying kohl, a dark eye makeup, the paper said. `` We found more than 100 earrings beside her skull, some small, some large. She had all her personal belongings buried with her in the grave,'' <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> said. The report said that rich royal tombs had been unearthed at Ashur, another Assyrian city, but none contained as many precious objects as the <ORGANIZATION> Nimrud </ORGANIZATION> grave. It said that although the Assyrian empire is well-documented, there are few references to the role of women at the royal court. However, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Semiramis </PERSON> is known to have ruled <LOCATION> Assyria </LOCATION> for five years at the end of the 9th century B.C.

 As President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held presummit talks with Italian leaders, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said today the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not withdraw troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> without consulting its Western allies. There also were hints the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might ease economic sanctions against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Leaving the door open for troop reductions, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the latest <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> proposal for reducing tanks and other conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> presents `` some opportunities'' for the West. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will discuss conventional force levels with 15 other allied leaders when a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting begins in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Monday. On three separate occasions today, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside reporters' questions about whether he was planning to announce withdrawal of as many as 30,000 troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, nearly 10 percent of the total stationed there <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held private talks with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> Saturday evening. Afterwards the pontiff praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for combatting `` the moral crisis'' of drugs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in turn spoke warmly of the pope's efforts for world peace and said `` we've made progress in reducing armaments.'' Before the audience with the pope, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held talks at a 16th century hillside villa with Italian Premier <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, and later conferred over lunch at the Quirinale Palace with President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> refused to discuss possible troop cutbacks but said, `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not unilaterally withdraw troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' meaning that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would consult first with its allies. In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, `` the president clearly will be discussing a number of ideas _ many of them have not been presented before.'' He said he could not discuss details. Asked whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might be willing to ease economic sanctions that were imposed against the Soviets in 1980, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> pointedly noted that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has withdrawn its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. It was the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 that prompted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to impose a ban on technology transfers to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said any action on lifting sanctions would depend on talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies. `` This is a matter we would have to discuss,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> left the door open for possible U.S.-Soviet talks on reducing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troop levels in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Until now, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been willing to talk only about <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks, artillery and other equipment but has ruled out direct negotiations over troop levels. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the Soviets were `` coming around to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> thinking'' and that there was `` a different climate we find promising.'' The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times reported that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to propose a 10 percent cutback in American troop strength in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which totals between 305,000 and 325,000 personnel. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted sources in today's editions as saying the administration is considering an offer to negotiate cuts in troop strength, aircraft and helicopters in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agrees to cuts in tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery pieces. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been under intense pressure at home and abroad to reply to a series of disarmament proposals from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with some ideas of his own. White House officials readily acknowledge that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has seemed too negative while Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been portrayed as a peacemaker. There is pressure in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for withdrawal of at least 8,000 troops, to pull back Americans whose jobs are eliminated by the 1987 U.S.-Soviet treaty to destroy medium-range nuclear missiles. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said discussions about conventional arms _ troops, tanks and non-nuclear artillery _ would be `` a major thrust of the discussions'' when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attends a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit Monday and Tuesday with leaders of 15 other Western nations. `` Any ideas in this area would be ones the president would want to discuss with the allies,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` He would raise -LRB- them -RRB- with his partners at this session before he discusses anything publicly.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting has been clouded by West German demands for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to begin negotiations soon to reduce _ possibly eliminate _ short-range nuclear missiles in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> oppose such talks now because of the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>'s superiority in tanks, troops and other conventional weapons. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> also fear the negotiations would ignite public pressure to eliminate the missiles entirely. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Italian premier agreed on the need to encourage reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and maintain <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> unity. They also discussed East-West talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on reducing conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On his arrival shortly before midnight Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no reference to reports of possible troop withdrawals. Instead, he declared the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants a `` stronger and more united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' and said he plans to be `` actively engaged in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, promoting measures to encourage political and economic liberalization in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in July.

 Cosmos 2021 became Object No. 20,000 in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Space Command's space catalog this week. The Soviet satellite was logged into the catalog at 5:30 a.m. Wednesday, the time of its launch. The Space Command's Surveillance Center is tracking about 7,000 manufactured space objects, but has cataloged every satellite or piece of junk larger than a softball in Earth orbit since Sputnik was launched on Oct. 4, 1957. The center has tracked a wrench and camera dropped by astronauts, bits and pieces of exploded rocket bodies, satellites and shuttles. Most of the 13,000 objects that have fallen back toward <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> burned up in the atmosphere. But a few more notable objects, such as the U.S.-built Skylab and the Soviet-built Cosmos 954, were too large to burn up and came crashing back to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Cosmos 954 and its nuclear reactor fell in northern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in January 1978; Skylab fell in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> in July 1979. The Space Surveillance Center uses radar and optical tracking devices to keep track of the objects. The information is used to ensure that the shuttle or other rockets depositing payloads in space do n't run into objects in orbit, or that a falling satellite is n't mistaken for a missile attack.

 Communist maverick <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and other outspoken <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> reformers lost their bids today for seats on a new standing legislature, and one suggested they join forces to fight the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and other reformers were elected in March to the 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, which in turn today chose the smaller, full-time Supreme Soviet and in doing so shut out many progressive candidates. Many party chiefs and top bureaucrats also faced stiff opposition from fellow congressmen but were elected to the Supreme Soviet, the revamped law-making body that replaces the rubber-stamp predecessor of the same name. The deputies voted Friday night from a ballot of 600 candidates _ all members of the congress _ to fill the 542-member Supreme Soviet. In the Baltic delegations, another hotbed of reform, deputies nominated only as many candidates as they had seats and succeeded in electing a number of radical leaders to the Supreme Soviet. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> won a majority of the votes of his fellow deputies but ran last out of 12 candidates vying for 11 Supreme Soviet seats designated for the Russian federation. Deputy <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Osipyan </PERSON>, chairman of the commission that counted the ballots overnight, said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> got 1,185 votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, with 964 members of the national congress voting against him. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said he was saddened and upset by the results but pledged to continue his crusade, indicating he might seek the vice presidency, which also will be voted on by the congress. `` I must fight to the end,'' he told reporters. He added that was his responsibility to the millions of Muscovites who sent him to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I must fulfill their will and their orders. I would n't throw away any job.'' The anti-establishment <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> headed a list of vanquished Moscow-based reformers and radicals, including sociologist <PERSON> Tatyana </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON>; economist <PERSON> Gavril </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON>; <PERSON> Ilya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaslavsky </PERSON>, an advocate for the handicapped; historian <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Stankevich </PERSON>; and biologist <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Yablokov </PERSON>. In a nationally televised session held in the Kremlim Palace of Congresses, many deputies applauded in delight as Osipyan announced the radicals' defeat. Before the balloting, some deputies complained the nominating procedure had been rigged to keep party and government officials in power. `` We have formed a Brezhnev-Stalin Supreme Soviet,'' said progressive historian <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> in dismay as election results were announced for the new 542-seat legislature. He called the results depressing. <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> declared `` the apparatus has undoubtedly won'' and called on progressive deputies from throughout the country to form an `` independent deputies' group'' to fight <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and state bureaucrats. `` The apparatus clearly wants to get retaliation, clearly wants to impose its own way at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> charged. He said `` deputies of a democratic orientation'' sought at first to work with fellow parliamentarians, but that `` from the beginning, our work has met with disbelief and prejudice.'' In consequence, `` a group of deputies considers it necessary to withdraw from the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> delegation,'' the economist announced. `` We are going to form ... an independent deputies' group, and invite all deputies to join us.'' If reformers unite, it would be the first opposition faction in the congress, where for decades the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership has imposed its will unimpeded by opposition. The deputies elected some more mainstream figures who proclaim support for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of `` perestroika,'' or restructuring, but who refrained at the congress from fiery rhetoric. They included agriculture reform advocate <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Emelyanov </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> editor <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Laptev </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON> and independent historian <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>. The Muscovites put up 55 candidates for the 29 seats allotted them, defending the principle of multicandidate elections but ensuring some of their number would be defeated. Many old-style candidates, including former cosmonaut <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> <PERSON> Savitskaya </PERSON>, beat out the reformers. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> lost his job as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss in November 1987 after he criticized the slow pace of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and suggested it was time for a multiparty system to end the communists' legal monopoly on power In his congressional campaign he attacked official privilege and called for a better life for average Soviets, and won nearly 90 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and the other deputies from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> drafted their own congressional agenda, including radical measures to revive the shortage-ridden Soviet economy. But the congress rejected any move to alter the agenda. In the Supreme Soviet vote, <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorotnikov </PERSON>, the only member of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> to stand as a candidate, met with stiff opposition, with 761 deputies voting against him. His 1,388 votes, however, were enough for him to outpoll <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and be elected. <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>, head of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, was opposed by 373 deputies, and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapto </PERSON>, chief of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Ideological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, got 282 `` no'' votes.

 A delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> left <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Saturday after four days of futile talks aimed at finding a solution to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political crisis. The delegates indicated they would ask that another OAS mission travel to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> soon for additional talks with Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the political forces trying to oust him. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who blames the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s troubles, told the mission it was up to the political parties to sit down and negotiate. Opposition leaders insisted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must negotiate because he is the real power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` There are complex problems and deep emotions involved in the Panamanian situation,'' said <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, Ecuadoran foreign minister and member of the four-man delegation. `` We have promoted communication between the different political sectors,'' <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said. `` We have fullfilled our mandate.'' He said the mission met with government and opposition leaders as well as <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> officials and other groups and made them all aware of the different points of view. `` Unfortunately, there has been no progress for the good of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, the opposition's presidential candidate in May 7 elections. `` The two sides have to start talking,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said. `` They both claim they won.'' The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> sent the mission, headed by Secretary-General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, to seek a solution to the impasse created by the annullment of the elections. International observers say <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s hand-picked candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, lost to <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. The Panamanian government claimed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> interfered openly in favor of the opposition by providing financial assistance and by repeatedly calling for the ouster of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> chief and the power behind the government. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> obtained a public condemnation of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>, which also blamed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for post-election violence, including attacks on the opposition candidates. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegates will submit a full report on their mission to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>, which must decide what to do next. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges, but he denies the allegations and says <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wants him out of power so it can renege on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties. Under those treaties, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must hand over control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> by the year 2000.

 A group of nostalgic Illinoisans with fond memories of two-lane blacktops and cruising on country roads are trying to rally support for the historical preservation of a highway. But they're not trying to save just any piece of asphalt with white lines and gravel shoulders. This group wants to preserve and commemorate the legendary <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Route 66, which was wiped off <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> maps in 1976 upon completion of Interstate 55 and erased nationwide in 1985. More than half of the old roadway is gone, while other pieces exist as local stretches of road. `` You'd be surprised how many people have a love affair with that old road,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, one of the group's leaders. `` But there's a lot of people out there who have strong feelings about Route 66 and what it represents.'' To <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> and about 35 other people scattered around the state, Route 66 represents a bygone era of small towns bustling with business created by travelers funneled down Main Street by the nation's highways. `` Many people associated Route 66 with freedom, opportunity, adventure and romance,'' said another organizer, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Teague </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. `` It was the epitome of the open road.'' <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> fondly remembers small motels, roadside hamburger joints, shade-tree mechanics and others who made a living in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> thanks to highway traffic. `` Route 66 really was Main Street, <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said. `` It was the ` mother road,' as <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> called it, that carried people west from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to all the way to the shores of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. It was an important road for Americans traveling by car.'' According to the book `` Route 66, a Photographic Essay,'' Route 66 was formed in 1926 when 2,448 miles of existing and new roads were connected to establish a link between <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. It was dubbed the `` gateway to the west'' and linked eight states and such cities as <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, on its way to the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> basin. `` I remember driving on Route 66 near <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> a few years ago,'' <PERSON> Teague </PERSON> said. `` The road was dipping and curving in topographical rhythm. It caressed the geography instead of bulling it over like the interstates do. Route 66 had character.'' The popular song about Route 66, -LRB- `` <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> looks oh, so pretty. ... Get your kicks on Route 66.'' -RRB- added to its appeal, as did the 1960s television show featuring two men in a sports car who experience carefree adventures on Route 66. `` That's always been in the back of my mind _ just taking off down the highway,'' <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said. `` That's part of the attraction.'' <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> and <PERSON> Teague </PERSON> are trying to form a Route 66 Association of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Two preliminary meetings have attracted three dozen people interested in preserving and enjoying the estimated 1,000 miles of remaining highway. They are supporting a resolution before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to authorize a study of the feasibility of preserving what's left of the road and naming it a national scenic highway. And <PERSON> Teague </PERSON> wants <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> lawmakers to follow the example of their <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> counterparts, who rededicated a 158-mile stretch of the old Route 66 in 1988. `` They wrote a song about this road and sang ` you can get your kicks on Route 66.' I ca n't imagine anyone singing ` you can shuck and jive on I-55.' It just does n't have the same appeal,'' <PERSON> Teague </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Western Military Spending Reported to Have Risen</HEAD>

 Military spending in western countries grew faster than their economies as a whole in the first half of the 1980s, according to a study based on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statistics. It was done by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> body financed by private foundations and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The study says the information is based on a handbook of statistics issued by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and a booklet of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> called `` World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers.'' A table shows that, after a drop in the 1970s, military spending between 1980 and 1985 grew by an average of 5.7 percent a year in the western industrial countries. Their gross national products, meanwhile, grew by an average 2.2 percent annually. In the `` centrally planned economies'' _ that is, countries under <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule _ the total growth was an average 1.7 percent and military spending grew even more slowly _ 1.3 percent, on average. The same pattern is reported for Third World countries, in which <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is included: total average growth of 3.1 percent, and average growth of military spending 2.1 percent. However, the study cautions that `` estimates for centrally planned economies are likely to have a wide margin of error.'' For the Third World, it quotes figures from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to show that 20 out of 36 countries increased the amount of production they devoted to military production between 1972 and 1986. All but three _ the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> _ reduced the proportion of their spending that went for health or education, or both. <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> cites another private study as saying that if the Third World countries _ oil-producers excepted _ had bought no arms between 1972 and 1982, they would have had debts that were 20 percent to 25 percent smaller. He said in an interview that he believes the same trend has continued in more recent years. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other creditor countries are working now to reduce Third World debt, estimated at $ 1.2 trillion, under a plan proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. Titled `` National Security: The Economic and Environmental Dimensions,'' the study argues that the true threat to security comes from damage to the environment, rather than from possible military attack. `` Future generations may regard our recent obsession with national security maintained by force of arms as a curious historical diversion that distracted our energies from the most basic threats to human society,'' it concludes.

<HEAD>Armenian Activist Released From Jail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An Armenian activist who was jailed late last year after widespread unrest in the southern <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region has been released at the urging of a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, journalists and activists said Saturday. The release of <PERSON> Khachik </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamboltsian </PERSON>, head of an Armenian charity group, fueled speculation that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> may soon free 13 other leaders of the Armenian protest movement that has been at the center of the unrest. A journalist at <ORGANIZATION> Armenpress </ORGANIZATION>, the local news agency, said <PERSON> Stamboltsian </PERSON>'s return to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, led to the cancellation of scattered strikes called to protest the detention of the activists. The journalist, who requested anonymity, said in a telephone inteview that <PERSON> Stamboltsian </PERSON> was freed after Armenian party chief <PERSON> Suren </PERSON> <PERSON> Arutyunyan </PERSON> asked the national prosecutor to `` show humanity'' toward the detained activist. `` The first response was <PERSON> Khachik </PERSON>'s release,'' said <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> activist <PERSON> Hovik </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassilian </PERSON>. `` And now there are rumors that either all the rest are out, or they soon will be,'' he said in a telephone interview. Authorities had been holding at least 14 people, 11 of them members of the <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that spearheaded demonstrations and strikes in a jurisdictional dispute touched off by ethnic friction. The <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last year launched a campaign for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to annex the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region, where three-quarters of the 162,000 inhabitants are ethnic Armenians. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is part of the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The Kremlin rejected the unification demand, putting <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> under <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s direct control instead and jailing the committee members. The Armenian drive to annex <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, launched in February 1988, led to ethnic strife between predominantly Christian Armenians and mostly Moslem Azerbaijanis in which more than 90 people were killed last year.

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dished out pasta for homeless women at a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> shelter Saturday and said she found `` great warmth and affection'' at the facility. The first lady set out on her own as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conferred with Italian officials during the first leg of a four-nation European trip. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also inspected one of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s crumbling monuments. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joined her husband later in the day for an audience with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. At the shelter, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was welcomed by resident <PERSON> Adelina </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunati </PERSON>, 65, who presented her with a bouquet of flowers. `` We checked it out from head to toe,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of the 72-bed facility, which was opened last year by the pope and is operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Missionaries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charity </ORGANIZATION>, the order founded by Nobel Peace Prize winner <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>. `` I'm going to visit <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> centers when I get back home,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said she found `` great warmth and affection'' at the shelter. Reporters were n't allowed to accompany Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as she toured the shelter, but a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official said the first lady helped serve rigatoni al sugo _ short, hollow, tube-shaped pasta with tomato sauce. The pasta was blessed by Australian Archbishop <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, deputy <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> secretary of state. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeke </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> also blessed the president and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the `` important mission they are undertaking for the good of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the world.'' Afterward, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> inspected Arch of Constantine at the edge of the ancient Roman Forum, where American tourists greeted her with a chorus of `` Hello <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shaded her eyes from the noon sun as she looked up at the triumphant arch erected in 315 A.D. to honor Emperor <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON>. The superintendent of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s archaeology department, <PERSON> Adriano </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> explained how the arch was decorated with fragments of other monuments. The state spent $ 1.5 million to clean off some of the black crust caused by automobile pollution in traffic-choked <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Restoration had to be halted when funds ran out, however, and the upper half remains whiter than the bottom. Security was tight. Italian police, armed with automatic weapons, were deployed along the edge of the <LOCATION> Palatine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> overlooking the arch. Helicopters buzzed overhead. Asked by a reporter to comment on criticism that her husband has been too cautious in dealing with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Now what has that to do with ruins?''

 <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> began campaigning for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority leader Saturday, one day after Democratic Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> dropped plans to run and said he would resign his seat in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, congressional sources said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s bid for the No. 2 spot in the leadership marked the latest development in an increasingly complex scramble among Democrats set off by the expected resignation of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination a year ago. His race for majority leader means he will `` unequivocally'' abandon any plans for a White House bid in 1992, said a source close to the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> lawmaker. The Missourian has an unblemished record on ethical matters, a major plus in the wake of financial controversies that have caused <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> to resign and brought <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to the brink of leaving the speaker's chair. The seven-term <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> lawmaker had been lobbied hard last week by some Democrats to run for majority leader, but he chose not to challenge <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, a friend and political ally. `` With <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> getting out and people persuading him to run for it, he made the decision that he would run for majority leader,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressional source said. Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., is expected to become speaker if <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigns next week With <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> out of the line of succession, the field is open for the No. 2 and No. 3 leadership posts. On Saturday, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was in his <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> office calling colleagues to seek their support for his leadership bid. His supporters said he would be the front-runner even if challenged by others. `` If <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> gets into it, my feeling is he is the next majority leader,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., who had not talked with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> about the race <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s decision did not daunt at least one other lawmaker who already is running for majority leader. Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., who began campaigning last week, said Saturday he remains in the race It ws unclear whether <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s candidacy would dissuade others from entering the race for majority leader. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> serve on the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s partisans say he would provide Democrats with a youthful, high-profile leader who could burnish the party image in the wake of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s ethical problems. The 48-year-old congressman is viewed by supporters as `` squeaky clean,'' having survived media scrutiny in 1988. He also has earned a reputation as an effective television-age advocate of tax overhaul and a get-tough trade policy, which was the centerpiece of his presidential campaign. Until the disclosure that <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> was stepping down from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was considering a run for the No. 3 post of whip <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> was a key early supporter of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s unsuccessful 1988 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, and the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> lawmaker reportedly did not want to damage his friendship with <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>. But that changed Friday night when <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> learned of <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s resignation from news accounts <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had met earlier Friday with <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> and was stunned when he found out later that his friend was leaving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, according to a congressional source with close ties to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>.

 Palestinians who lost relatives in the anti-Israeli uprising met Saturday with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace activists, and some warned that Arabs might take up arms unless <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> agrees to talk peace with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. In the occupied territories, troops wounded seven Palestinians in scattered stone-throwing clashes, Arab hospital officials reported. In three villages and a refugee camp in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, about 3,000 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> activists from the Peace Now movement met with <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> who have lost family members in the 17-month-old uprising. Soldiers watched the gatherings from afar without intervening. Leaders of the 70,000 Jewish settlers living in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> condemned the meetings. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Nahalin </LOCATION>, 200 <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> men, women and children greeted the Israelis. `` I stand here and greet you because we need peace,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Attiyah </PERSON>, whose 22-year-old son <PERSON> Subhi </PERSON> was shot and killed in a raid last month that left five Palestinians dead and 18 injured. Palestinians warned that uprising activists were inclined to use weapons against the army if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> persisted in its refusal to talk peace with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which the government considers a terrorist organization. `` The people with weapons are beginning to wake up,'' said village leader <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON>. `` We must warn that a true revolution is possible if we do not achieve our rights.'' `` We must remind the Israeli government that the Palestinian nation has its roots here, and there must be peace with our sole legitimate representative, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> said. Last week, a soldier was killed and three Palestinians wounded in the first gun battle between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> activists. In all, 498 Palestinians and 22 Israelis have died since the rebellion against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began in December 1987. The Peace Now movement advocates opening talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and establishing an independent Palestinian state. The Israeli government has ruled out either. `` If we can prove to Israelis that relations, even political, are possible, it would also make possible the idea of a compromise and withdrawal,'' <PERSON> Yoki </PERSON> <PERSON> Amir </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> lecturer, said at <LOCATION> Nahalin </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, soldiers shot and wounded seven Palestinians in stone-throwing clashes, Arab hospital officials reported. They said the victims included a 16-year-old girl shot in the head and a 60-year-old woman shot in the ear. The army said it was checking the reports.

 Powerful currents that collapsed and swallowed a temporary one-lane bridge over the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> prevented authorities from finding any victims or their vehicles on Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said seven people remained unaccounted for, but there was no way to know how many of them might have been on the bridge when it fell into the river Friday evening. Authorities said efforts to find them could be thwarted for at least several days by the rushing, muddy water. Officials are uncertain how many vehicles plunged into the river when a 100-foot section of the bridge collapsed. Eyewitness accounts differed, but authorities believed at least two vehicles were on the bridge section when it gave out. The number of passengers aboard was unclear. `` We still have no idea,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The river, a tributary of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, jumped its banks Friday following heavy overnight rains that took two lives elsewhere in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. County engineers said the bridge was ordered closed a few minutes before the collapse because of the danger from debris pinned against it, but the order had not been carried out when the bridge collapsed. The river was searched Saturday by helicopter, but no trace of vehicles or victims was found. Authorities tried to use an air-supported boat, but without success. The river crested early Saturday at about 24 feet, eight feet over flood stage. `` Now it's just a matter of time before it starts receding,'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said. The fast-flowing river, littered with trees, tires and other debris, left searchers virtually helpless. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said recovery efforts will be stalled until the waters subside. `` You ca n't even put divers out _ it's too dangerous,'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said. `` Our boats ca n't handle the swift currents.'' The bridge collapsed at <LOCATION> Miamitown </LOCATION>, a town of 700 people about seven miles from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> on the western side of <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Dozens of people gathered at the ends of the bridge Saturday, craning their necks to see the missing section. Chaplains from the sheriff's department were at the scene in case counseling was needed, but the Rev. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Kremp </PERSON> said there was n't much for them to do because of the lingering uncertainty over the victims' identities. The one-lane temporary bridge has been in use for only a few months. It was erected last year to keep traffic flowing while a 94-year-old bridge is torn down and rebuilt a few feet to the south. Traffic lights at either end of the 300-foot temporary bridge regulated traffic over the narrow span. The county's chief engineer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brayshaw </PERSON>, said he ordered the bridge closed Friday immediately after the bridge contractor, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Strongsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, told him that the debris-choked river posed a danger to the span. The collapse occurred before workers could reach it and set up barricades. `` The car in front of us just dropped straight down,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Boebinger </PERSON>, who was waiting to cross the bridge when it collapsed. `` I said, ` Oh my God.' I put it in reverse and backed up. I did n't feel the bridge shake at all. It just happened in an instant.'' Floods caused by heavy thunderstorms elsewhere in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> were blamed for the deaths of a 20-month-old boy who drowned after falling into a swollen creek near his grandmother's home and a 24-year-old Fostoria woman whose car was washed into a river.

 Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the No. 3 Democrat in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday he will resign from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to spare himself and his party the ordeal of a protracted ethics investigation like the one that torched the career of Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. The surprise announcement means <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats could be installing a totally revamped leadership team by the end of next week, with <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the likely new speaker and several candidates vying for the next two posts of majority leader and majority whip. The end appeared near to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s 2 -LCB- - year reign as speaker _ and perhaps his 34 -LCB- - year career in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ because of charges brought by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat stands accused of arranging bulk sales of his book as a way to evade <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits on outside income and of taking gifts from a developer friend with an interest in legislation. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyers failed last week in an attempt to convince the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee to drop at least some of the charges in exchange for the speaker's resignation. He was in seclusion this weekend, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership was preparing for him to deliver a resignation speech Wednesday. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the current whip, began running for the post of majority leader last week when it became known that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was thinking about quitting. However, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> was coming under increasing scrutiny because of his business dealings, including a deal where a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings-and-loan official arranged and helped finance a junk bond investment. A newspaper reported that a federal investigation had begun, and on Friday Common Cause, the group that lobbies for stricter government ethics, called on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee to investigate <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s finances. `` I have simply spent too much time building the party and trying to help people to have my attention or abilities devoted to such distractions,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said in a resignation statement that called the charges `` needless and baseless.'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said his colleagues had expressed confidence in him and he would have won the majority leader's race. `` Undoubtedly, some will think this decision was motivated by weakness in my political standing or my legal position. They are entitled to their opinion, but they are wrong,'' he said. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s statement, made available to news organizations, made no mention of it, but several legislators said privately that he had been admonished by others not to run for higher leadership. He would become more of a target, and further injure the party structure, already reeling because of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s travails, they said. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, himself, remained out of public view on Saturday. His statement said the resignation is effective June 15 _ his 47th birthday. Even before <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> dropped out, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> was being urged to challenge for the majority leader's post With his friend <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> out of the race, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> began his campaign in earnest on Saturday. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said he was `` stunned'' by <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s decision and praised the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> congressman as `` an extraordinarily able and effective leader.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> gave up a job in the Democratic leadership to run for president in 1988. He is now promising colleagues he will not run for president in 1992 if he wins the majority leader's job. Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., began campaigning for leader last week as an alternative to <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> and said Saturday he was still in the running <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> declined to handicap his race against <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, but said many members saw `` a need to bring some new blood, maybe outside the -LRB- established -RRB- leadership group, into the game for the good of the party and of the institution.'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> has support from Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., the powerful chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> At least a three-way race was under way for the whip's post, between <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., who holds <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s former post as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., the chief deputy whip, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> The election for speaker would be held immediately if <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> were to leave because the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> can not function with that constitutionally-mandated job vacant. The other party positions could be elected at the same time or at a later date. But the Democrats were expected to get it all taken care of in no more than a week or two. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said the resignations and the ensuing shakeup will make the party look bad. `` In the near term, we've got a problem of public perception,'' he said. But he said `` the spotlight shifts to the Republicans'' soon because one of their leaders, Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., is the subject of a complaint before the ethics committee On the other hand, the House GOP, which has largely sat on the sidelines during <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s travails lest the ethics probe be seen as a partisan vendetta, may become more aggressive. Republicans are likely to redouble their emphasis on institutional changes, including pressing for campaign reform and tougher ethics standards. That would enable them to keep political pressure on the Democrats by keeping the ethics issue alive without appearing to be attacking individual personalities.

 South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> met with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> on Saturday and pledged anew to end white domination of blacks in his country. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> also discussed a planned visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by F.W. <PERSON> DeKlerk </PERSON>, the leader of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the man expected to become the country's president later this year. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, in a brief exchange with reporters after the meeting, ssid <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> had `` indicated to us it is the intention of the South African government to abolish the system of apartheid and we were pleased to hear that.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> concurred. `` We are in the process of reform, and we are dismantling apartheid, and we accept that white domination must end,'' Both said. He said the decision was taken by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African government for its own policy reasons and not in response to outside pressures. `` It's going to be done in consultation with black leaders,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. Later, the White House issued a statement saying <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> had told <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> his party would campaign for the South African presidency with the view that `` the days of white domination are over.'' The statement said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> raised questions about denial of human and civil rights of black <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>, individual cases of detention and restrictions on freedom of travel. `` The secretary said that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government intended to engage with a full range of black and white South Africans in an effort to work towards the goal of producing peaceful abolition of apartheid,'' the statement added. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that in view of the government changes coming up in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had taken `` this opportunity to explore any possible changes that might be taking place in the policies of that government at this time.''

<TEXT>
 `` Shame on you,'' strikers yell at patrons entering and leaving Tavern on the Green, one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best-known restaurants `` Please help us or we will die,'' the restaurant management pleads in a newspaper advertisement aimed at potential patrons of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>'s toniest dining spot. The monthlong strike at Tavern on the Green may not rival the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike in size or impact on the public, but the two sides in the restaurant battle yield to no one in rhetoric or passion. Each side accuses the other of lying. In the advertisement, manager <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> calls the restaurant's workers `` among the highest paid in the restaurant world.'' `` They are not even the highest-paid in a square mile of his restaurant,'' snaps back <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turchiano </PERSON>, a spokesman for Local 6 of the Hotel-Motel Trades Council. But while business is down _ and <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> admits losing millions of dollars _ business lunchers and out-of-towners continue to come for the clubby atmosphere, creme brulee, red snapper and Sunday brunch. `` Best reception I ever got,'' joked one business-suited man Friday after passing through the `` shame on you'' chants. `` It's very annoying, them yelling at you,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, who was lunching with friends. But, she added, `` I wanted to eat at Tavern on the Green.'' Management claims Tavern on the Green's workers are among the best-paid in the business, with a base pay of $ 18,830 for dishwashers, the lowest-paid workers at the restaurant. Waiters make $ 2.60 an hour plus tips, bringing their total wages to $ 39,000 to $ 45,000 a year, management says. <PERSON> Turchiano </PERSON> disputes those figures, saying dishwashers who work five-day, 40-hour weeks make $ 8,320 a year and that while some waiters make $ 40,000 annually, most earn between $ 17,000 and $ 19,000 a year. The union has rejected a 21.4 percent increase, saying workers need 40 percent _ more for dishwashers _ to rise to the level of workers at comparable restaurants. The two sides also disagree about heath care benefits and work conditions. The union has been trying to negotiate a contract with LeRoy since January and mounted an informational picket line on April 23. The strike began April 30, when <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> fired workers en masse for holding a meeting on restaurant premises. Details of the incident are murky. Management says there was a partial walkout by 11 employees; the union says 200 workers called an impromptu meeting. In any event, some workers walked out and were barred from returning. Most of the rest refused to work and were fired. The restaurant management has since hired replacement workers, and claims to have a full complement of 430 workers. The union says 275 of its members are on strike and 10 have remained on the job. <PERSON> Turchiano </PERSON> accused <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> of `` spending a fortune to keep the workers from getting a decent contract.'' <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> said he plans to fight even more fiercely. He said he will file a lawsuit Wednesday alleging libel, slander and interference with business. `` This is a very rough union playing dirty and telling lies,'' <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> said. `` I'm a good employer and I have good employees. This is a crazy situation.'' `` He knows how to entertain,'' shot back <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Palozzi </PERSON>, a striking waiter, `` but he does n't know how to take care of his workers.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has chosen Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> to succeed him, and the change of power may come next week, news reports said Sunday. Nearly all major <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> media carried reports that Uno is likely to become <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s next prime minister when <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> resigns after 18 months in office because of a huge bribery scandal. In a meeting Saturday with <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in the governing party, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> indicated that <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was his choice as successor, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. The prime minister said he would seek a consensus on Uno's selection as party head from other party leaders next week, the reports said The head of the governing party routinely becomes prime minister because of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' large majority in parliament. Uno, 66, told reporters that he had not yet been asked officially to take the post and said it was `` too early to comment'' on whether he would accept. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> as saying `` You should keep around June 2 in mind'' for the change in administrations. Party leaders said <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> emerged as the top contender after talks Friday between <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, chairman of the party's policy-making Executive Council, according to reports in the nationally circulated <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> newspapers <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, 76, refused May 13 to take the top job, citing his age and poor health. His refusal eliminated the only strong candidate in a governing party desperate for a leader with a reputation clean enough to steer it out of the scandal before elections for half the seats in the upper house in July. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said he would leave as scheduled Sunday for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where he is to attend a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. He is due to return June 4, but officials said he would return immediately if the Cabinet is dissolved before then. Party leaders reportedly favor <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> because he is untainted by the Recruit bribery scandal that has led to more than a dozen arrests, and because he is experienced in foreign affairs and therefore capable of leading the Japanese delegation at the July summit of industrialized nations. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> told reporters Saturday that he believed that extensive political reforms were needed to deal with the Recruit scandal. The <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the publishing and information services conglomerate at the center of the scandal, is accused of trying to influence government policy by selling underpriced, unlisted shares in a real estate subsidiary and by doling out millions of dollars in political donations. In addition to forcing <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation, the scandal has led to the downfall of three <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers and the arrest of a former chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary. In the meeting with <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> on Friday, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> agreed to stay on as prime minister until a successor was found, although on April 25 he vowed to leave office when the year's budget cleared parliament. The $ 431 billion budget officially took effect Sunday despite an opposition boycott that blocked debate on the spending bill in the upper house. Under Japanese law, the budget automatically becomes law 30 days after being passed by the lower house even if the upper chamber fails to act on it.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> chuckled when it was first suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, which had elected him speaker just a year earlier, investigate his ethics. `` I do n't think it really warrants too much of an answer,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters on Dec. 15, 1987 _ the day Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> called for a formal inquiry into what he called the corrupt and blatantly unethical behavior of the veteran <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat. The chuckles have turned to anguish. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> took the proposal more seriously than <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did.

The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> reported in June 1987 that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had intervened with <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, on behalf of a savings and loan executive who had been a longtime political supporter and whose S & amp; L activities were under board scrutiny at the time. The board confirmed that <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> had held a lengthy meeting with the executive at <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s urging. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> merely `` encouraged him to make sure his agency was being fair.'' Then, in September, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was receiving book royalties of 55 percent, five times higher than those normally given to authors, from a friend's company that received $ 265,000 from his 1986 campaign. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> defended the deal, saying it had been profitable both to him and to his publisher. Other news reports raised questions about <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s efforts to secure federal grants for a multimillion-dollar historical renovation of the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> stockyards, in which his business partner, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, was involved. Tired of answering questions, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> announced on Oct. 16 that he was putting his assets in a blind trust. Meanwhile, the new speaker was raising hackles on the Republican side of the House. During a close vote on a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> deficit-cutting bill, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> `` stopped the clock'' for nearly 10 minutes while finding a member to switch votes so the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leadership could avoid defeat. He joked about it as his `` hidden ball play,'' but angry <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans created a 14-member panel to seek ways to deal with the crafty Texan. `` With Tip there was warmth and affection,'' said then-Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., now secretary of `` There are no such feelings for <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>.'' Rep. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, then the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> whip and now a senator, said the House was being run by `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his goons.'' On May 18, 1988 _ just over a year ago _ president <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal-leaning public interest lobby, announced that his group would ask the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee to investigate whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had violated conflict-of-interest rules. Republicans said the announcement took much of the steam out of charges that the demands for an investigation were just a political vendetta. `` Having Common Cause come out changed the whole dynamics and legitimized the issue,'' said <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>. On May 26, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> and 71 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans formally asked for an ethics committee investigation. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> promised cooperation and said he was sure he had violated no rules. On June 10, the six Democrats and six Republicans on the committee voted unanimously to conduct a preliminary inquiry of the royalty arrangement for the book, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s use of public funds to compensate an aide who worked on the book, his dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in the savings and loan case, his lobbying efforts for a constituent with whom he had an interest in a gas well, his intervention on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and his use of a condominium in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> provided by <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>. More allegations came along. A longtime friend said he paid <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> $ 5,000 for copies of his book as a legal way to get around federal limits on campaign contributions. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> listed more people who bought bulk copies, including a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> insurance company and a fellow congressman. Records showed that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had funneled more than $ 50,000 in business from his congressional office to the printer who paid him his royalties. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> acknowledged selling 504 copies of the book to a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> university instead of accepting a $ 3,000 speaking fee that would have violated House rules. On July 26, the committee named <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> to investigate, saying an outside counsel was needed to assure a fair and objective probe. On Sept. 14, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> testified for 5 -LCB- hours in closed session and told reporters he believed he would be exonerated. In November, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> subpoenaed records on work that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, did for Mallightco, the partnership formed by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> and their wives Until 1984, she had been paid $ 18,000 a year as an advisor to the investment venture. When <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reconvened Jan. 3, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was re-elected speaker and pledged a spirit of bipartisanship. A month later, he was in new political hot water over what critics called his awkward handling of a proposed congressional pay raise, which failed after <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> sought to have it approved without a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote. On Feb. 21, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> submitted his final report to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee. On April 13, amid reports that the panel was about to conclude it had found reason to believe that he violated House rules, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made an emotional defense of his conduct and his wife's in a 30-minute appearance before television cameras. He declined to answer questions. Four days later, the committee formally charged the speaker with 69 violations of the chamber's rules, including what Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., the committee chairman, called `` a scheme to evade'' limits on outside income through sales of the book The most serious allegation stemmed from the committee's conclusion that <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, from whom <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had accepted $ 145,000 in what the committee viewed as gifts over a 10-year period, had a direct interest in legislation. In a half-hour speech to a closed <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucus on April 18, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> acknowledged that he `` may have made some mistakes in my life,'' but vowed to fight the charges and win. And in a speech in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> on May 5, he said that `` the most unethical behavior I have witnessed is that of those who, for their own ravening ambitions, attempt to destroy the personal reputations of political opponents.'' On May 9 he lashed out at <LOCATION> Phelan </LOCATION>, accusing the outside counsel of `` lack of professionalism and prevalence of distortion and inaccuracy'' in his report. The next day, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced it would review <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s conduct after the House investigation was completed. House Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s problems had contributed to a `` state of suspended animation'' in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but the Democratic leader, Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the speaker was still `` fully involved.'' By May 18, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s support in the House was eroding as even his supporters talked of easing him from his post. `` It's time for a leadership change,'' said <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>. The committee opened public hearings on May 23, with <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>, urging the panel to `` stand in the way of a lynch mob'' and dismiss the most serious charges against the speaker <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>'s arguments failed to move the committee. After a day of fruitless negotiations, friends of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said Thursday the speaker had decided to resign from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I earnestly believe that I have committed no serious wrong,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said.

 Soviet television viewers got to tune into their first <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> game on Saturday, even if it was n't Saturday's game.

 Soviet spy ships are eavesdropping off the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> about two out of every three days, a sharp increase over the past two years, a newspaper reported Saturday. In the early and mid-1980s, such Soviet monitoring occurred on fewer than one out of 10 days, said Adm. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1987, specially designed Soviet vessels, called auxiliary general intelligence ships, have been found two out of every three days just beyond the 12-mile territorial limit that marks the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' offshore boundary, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Saturday's editions. `` There has been a significant increase in Soviet <ORGANIZATION> AGI </ORGANIZATION> activity in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> area since 1986,'' said Lt.

I thoroughly studied the list of candidates to the Supreme Soviet -LRB- the full-time legislature elected by the congress -RRB-. I must say, and I am convinced of this, that if we take into account the level of qualification compared to the tasks the Supreme Soviet must decide ... we have formed a Brezhnev-Stalin Supreme Soviet. `` Now, about the majority that has formed at the congress. This also depresses me ... I am addressing you all, the aggressive-obedient majority, and you, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergeyevich </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB-, who is either attentively listening to the majority or skillfully manipulating it. We can continue the work the same way, we may be obedient ... but let us not forget those who sent us here to the congress. And they sent us here not for that ... but to drastically change the situation in the country.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Gavril </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON>, liberal economist who was among those defeated: `` Deputies with a democratic orientation inevitably formed a minority at the congress. We knew this. We had two choices as to how to act. First, to try to play the role of opposition, and second, to become involved in the constructive work of the congress. We chose the second. `` But from the very beginning our work has met with some disbelief and prejudice ... The documents we prepared have not been copied so far and distributed among the deputies. `` It is becoming more and more evident that the apparatus clearly wants to retaliate, clear that it wants to impose its own way of work at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In these conditions it is impossible to support the variant we first chose, it would not be understood either by our country or by those who elected us. `` That is why we have to think about changing our positions. A group of deputies considers it necessary to withdraw from the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> delegation. We are going to form an ... independent deputies group and invite all deputies to join us.''

 <PERSON> Ales </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamovich </PERSON>, a reformer famous for his novels about the horrors of World War II in <LOCATION> Byleorussia </LOCATION>: `` I heard once, the people stopped drinking, sobered up a little, looked around and asked, ` Where is the czar?' What does it mean, woke up? I witnessed myself during the war that people, very often out of fear, went into a deep sleep ... It was a kind of protective reaction of the body. That was how people were killed in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, while the rest hibernated. `` And what did we find when we finally woke up? ... We realize that after this long sleep we are not a modern state that sets an example for others but an underdeveloped superstate which is losing its ability to develop, to transform the mentally crippled administrative child into a normal, social organism, to create a working economy. `` People have great hopes for this congress. Does our work justify their hopes? ... Wo n't we be forced to buy dark glasses, so that at the end of the congress, we can slip like shadows through the crowds which stand each day outside the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>? `` The supreme power in the country should belong to the people, but in reality it belongs to the party ... Without the power to exercise control -LRB- over the budget and the party apparatus -RRB-, the congress wo n't be able to do much. `` And it goes without saying that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> can vote no-confidence in the government ... if it is obviously unable to fulfill its duties. `` The windows of Western shops are full of goods. In our shop windows, it would not be a bad idea to hang the portraits of ministers, the agriculture minister in the butcher's shop, and so on.''

Frankly, I did not believe in all this, but here is what we have now _ the speeches of <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Popov </PERSON>. `` I was amazed to hear such phrases as the Brezhnev-Stalin wing ... I know these comrades as persistent supporters of democracy. And democracy implies patience for dissent. When such impatience is shown toward an alternatively thinking majority ... I start to doubt whether they persistently defend democracy. `` We have already answered the question ` Who is guilty?' completely enough. It is high time to answer the questions ` What to do?' and ` How to do it?'''

Not only was he elected by five million Muscovites, but at almost 2,000 enterprises he was the nominated candidate. In this case, it means that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> neglects the opinion of the people, this is a discreditation of the Congress ...

 The new Soviet congress dealt reformists a major setback Saturday by rejecting maverick <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and several other prominent reformers who were seeking seats on the powerful Supreme Soviet legislature. Thousands of Muscovites disappointed with the results gathered for a rally that lasted through the night, and reformers in congress vowed to form an opposition bloc to challenge the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Down with the bloodsuckers who prey on the people!'' roared one speaker at the rally. The furor was set off when the 2,250-seat <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies chose which of its members would serve on the new Supreme Soviet, a full-time, 542-seat legislature The election results and blunt debate that followed were televised live. `` The supreme power in the country should belong to the people, but in reality it belongs to the party,'' said <PERSON> Ales </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamovich </PERSON>, a writer from <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> and member of the congress. During a recess, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sought to reassure Soviets accustomed to decades of empty institutional ritual that such clashes of opinion are to be expected. `` One need not panic,'' he said in remarks broadcast later on national television. `` We can not sit ceremoniously at the meetings knowing that outside the hall, there is a stormy life with a lot of problems.'' Congressional deputies voted Friday to fill the Supreme Soviet seats from among 573 candidates chosen by congress deputies from their home regions. The results were announced Saturday. The congress rejected an 11th-hour attempt by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to have his protege, <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON>, installed as vice president. Weary deputies loudly complained the president's choice was being forced through, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> agreed to put the matter off until Monday. In secret balloting for the Supreme Soviet, congressional deputies elected a number of reform advocates from the tiny Baltic republics, whose representatives nominated only as many candidates as they had seats. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deputies, however, nominated 55 candidates for their 29 seats, and <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and other prominent Moscow-based reformers were among the losers. Also defeated were sociologist <PERSON> Tatyana </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON>, economist <PERSON> Gavril </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON>, advocate for the handicapped <PERSON> Ilya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaslavsky </PERSON>, historian <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Stankevich </PERSON> and biologist <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Yablokov </PERSON>. Many old-style candidates, among them former cosmonaut <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> <PERSON> Savitskaya </PERSON>, defeated the reformers. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> scored a landslide victory in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in spring elections for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> and is among the country's most popular political figures He said he was saddened by the results but indicated he may challenge <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON> for the vice presidency. `` I must fight to the end,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told reporters. `` I would n't throw away any job.'' Several thousand Muscovites gathered in a stadium parking lot to protest <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s defeat. One speaker, teacher <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON>, said he sent a telegram to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> telling him, `` I have less and less respect for you and more and more'' for progressive <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deputies. `` But is it really life, if it's in chains? But is it really an election, if it's in fetters?'' read one placard. But in the Palace of Congresses, many deputies applauded as <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Osipyan </PERSON>, chairman of the vote-counting commission, announced in a droning voice the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> reformers' defeat. <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravchenko </PERSON>, director-general of the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, defended the election. `` For God's sake, let's not have chaos Everywhere and in everything there should be order.'' <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Meshalkin </PERSON>, a Siberian health official, accused the reformers of sour grapes. `` They find themselves in the minority, and the result can not satisfy them,'' he said. `` They instigate work aimed at breaking the congress into factions.'' Before the balloting in the first competitively elected parliament in 70 years, some deputies complained the nominating procedure had been rigged to keep party and government officials in power. `` The apparatus has undoubtedly won,'' <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> declared to his fellow deputies. He called on progressives nationwide to form an `` independent deputies' group'' to fight <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and state bureaucrats. <PERSON> Popov </PERSON>'s declaration could lead to the first opposition faction in a Soviet legislature, where for decades the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership has imposed its will unimpeded by opposition. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> garnered a narrow majority, with 1,185 deputies supporting him and 964 against, but he ran last among 12 candidates for the 11 seats reserved for the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> federation in one of the Supreme Soviet's two chambers, the 271-seat Soviet of Nationalities. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s defeat was a severe setback. His attacks on official privilege, calls for a better life for average Soviets and his suggestion that the party should discuss permitting a multi-party democracy have made him a special target of the party's Old Guard. <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorotnikov </PERSON>, the only member of the ruling party Politburo to stand as a candidate and the president of the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> federation, outpolled <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> with 1,388 votes. During the afternoon break, Soviet viewers got to tune into their first <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> game _ even if it was a month old. Soviet viewers had to settle for the April 28 playoff contest between the <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suns </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuggets </ORGANIZATION>. As the break at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> drew to a close, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Suns </ORGANIZATION> sank two foul shots, leading <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> to a 104-103 victory.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> assured Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Saturday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is making progress to reduce armaments and is committed to helping spur economic and political reforms in the pontiff's homeland and elsewhere across <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The pope, after nearly an hour of private talks with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the papal library, praised the American president's commitment `` to liberate the youth of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from the destructive forces of drug abuse'' and to alleviate poverty. The pope called for renewed efforts to battle the `` moral crisis'' afflicting society all over the world. A senior <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official, who requested anonymity, said the sweeping changes in communist <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the civil war in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were the main themes of the private talks between the two men. `` While we are still far from realizing the Biblical injunction to turn our swords into plowshares, we have made progress in reducing armaments, and in decreasing the threat of war,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the pope. Turning to the civil war in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We've heard your eloquent appeals for an end to the violence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and my heart, too, aches for the people of that once peaceful land.'' The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> visit came near the end of the first full day of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip, which takes him to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Sunday for a summit with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies divided over how best to proceed on arms talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. As a Pole and head of a church that plays an important role in eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has an unusual vantage from which to offer advice on the changes taking place in the region. Both the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and the president recalled passages from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inauguration speech The pope approved <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s declaration that the only proper use of power is to serve people, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said anew that `` a new breeze is blowing'' across the world and bringing greater freedom. `` May God bless <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and make her strong in her defense of human dignity and in her service to life,'' including the life of `` the weakest and most defenseless ones, those as yet unborn,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said, repeating an anti-abortion plea he also made at the end of his last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pilgrimage in 1987. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thanked him `` for this opportunity to visit with you to share in your wisdom, and I assure you of our intent to work ever more fervently for peace, justice and freedom throughout the world.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, scheduled to visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in July, noted the accords between the government and the opposition aimed at providing greater freedom and the communist state's agreement to give the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> legal status. `` This triumph represents the first full normalization of church-state relations in any communist state _ and it is a tribute to your enduring commitment to freedom,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. ` ` As you know, I recently announced a package of financial measures that signaled our active engagement in encouraging economic and political reform in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and elsewhere in eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he added The president's wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, dressed in a black suit and small black veil, joined her husband and the pope after their private talk. The Bushes later toured the Sistine Chapel together. A 33-member presidential entourage also got to meet the pope, including the military officer who carries the black briefcase known as the `` football'' that contains the codes to be used in event of a nuclear attack. When the officer lined up to shake hands with the pontiff, he left the briefcase at his seat. Later, addressing 250 American seminarians, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he and the pope discussed `` broad questions of peace, freedom and justice as they apply or ought to apply all over the world.'' `` It's a talk that I'll long remember,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, an Episcopalian. `` I leave once again inspired by his moral and spiritual leadership.'' The seminarians burst into a chorus of `` God Bless America'' after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke. As the pope and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the national security adviser, met with <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> Secretary of State Cardinal <PERSON> Agostino </PERSON> <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON> and other top <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> will meet with Soviet Leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> here in November, the first time a Soviet Communist party chief will sit down with the leader of the world's 850 million Roman Catholics. The pope has spoken favorably if cautiously of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies of glasnost and perestroika to open up and reform Soviet society <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has expressed strong support of attempts by the independent Polish labor union Solidarity to do the same in his homeland. No world leader encounters so wide a range of visitors as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. On the eve of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit, he met with an official Bulgarian delegation, Lebanon-bound Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> official who reportedly came with an invitation for the first-ever papal visit to the communist island nation.

 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said Saturday he opposed postponing proposed U.S.-Soviet talks on short-range nuclear weapons as a possible compromise in the dispute within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> over the issue. In a surprise move, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> flew later to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> for talks with Prime Minister <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> over the division in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> has offered to mediate the dispute, in which <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is trying to persuade the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to agree to early talks with the Soviets on short-range atomic arsenals. A government spokesman told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kohl </ORGANIZATION>'s talks with <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> were part of an earlier planned meeting with <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> to discuss a number of topics But there had been no announcement of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s plans to confer with <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>. Speaking to reporters in the southern city of <LOCATION> Nuremberg </LOCATION> before leaving for the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said superpower negotiations on the short-range atomic arsenals `` can not be postponed into the distant future.'' `` We are the front-line country in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. It is clear that we should be speaking up for our interests,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, seeking to avert a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> split, has reversed a firm stand against such negotiations and agreed to talks with the Soviets at an unspecified time on reducing the number of short-range nuclear weapons. Also Saturday, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s junior coalition partners made a veiled threat to pull out of the government if the chancellor agreed to unacceptable compromises on the issue during <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit that opens Monday. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is caught between liberal elements within his coalition and conservatives who fear the internal feud endangers the Western alliance. Public opinion polls show most Germans want the Lance atomic rockets removed from German soil rather than modernized, as <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> advocates. Defense Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> reiterated <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s call for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talks with the Soviets on the issue, the <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported But it said <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> also noted <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> ca n't formulate European defense policy alone. `` We must connect our interests to the clear goal of coming to a common position within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> through give and take,'' <PERSON> Soltenberg </PERSON> said in the interview to be published Sunday. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have tried to heal their rift over <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s call for early talks on the short-range missiles The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> say the talks should not occur while the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has superiority in conventional forces. West German newspapers said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> on Tuesday threatened to pull his minority <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> out of the governming coalition if <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> softens his stand. Members of the coalition are <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, its conservative Bavarian sister party, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, and the business-oriented Free Democrats. Some members of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government, including <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON>, reportedly have been angered by <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s aggressiveness in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> dispute. Newspaper reports said <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> noted <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has agreed in principle to start up negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons and the question now is when those talks should begin.

 A posse armed with shotguns killed about 50 pigeons after changing from lighter ammunition that was `` pretty much bouncing off'' the birds, police said. A one-block area was sealed off and police authorized eight people to shoot the pigeons, which had been damaging buildings and posing a health hazard to the community, said Police Chief <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>. `` Last week we used 8-shot and it was pretty much bouncing off. We were hitting them and the feathers would fly and they just kept going,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said. `` This time we used 4-shot and were knocking them out pretty good.'' The group bagged about 50 birds Thursday night. An earlier outing claimed only 15, <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said. The City Council approved the pigeon shoot, <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said, after getting a letter from a doctor and the city attorney confirming the need to eradicate the birds. The pigeon plague descended on this northeastern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> community after the razing of an old bank building, which they used as a roost.

 Politics was n't the first career choice of <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrat, whose savvy and partisan skills helped him climb to the highest ranks of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, originally wanted to be a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest. But while <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the son of a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> dairy farmer, was attending college at <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, he was rejected for the priesthood after he discovered he had epilepsy. At that point, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> got a lucky break. <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, wife of the famed comedian <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, heard about his problems and persuaded her husband to offer help. Hope suggested that <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> could serve the public in another way _ politics. The young college graduate came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, went into the office of his congressman, Rep. <PERSON> B.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisk </PERSON>, and got hired. Within five years, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> became <PERSON> Sisk </PERSON>'s administrative assistant, his top aide, and when <PERSON> Sisk </PERSON> retired in 1978, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> was ready at the age of 36. He ran for <PERSON> Sisk </PERSON>'s seat and won easily, polling 60 percent, a margin that rose with succeeding elections. He announced Saturday that he will resign June 15 _ his 47th birthday. He said he decided to resign to spare himself and his party the ordeal of a protracted ethics investigation into a $ 100,000 junk bond deal in 1986. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> showed himself to be an adept politician and quickly won a reputation for fierce partisanship. In his first term, he was picked for the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a choice seat for a freshman congressman and a key post for a man from his district. While taking care of his district, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> also kept an eye on the internal politics of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and when the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> opened up in 1981, he jumped in quickly and won the job. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> had few contenders for the position. The panel had been outspent by a large margin by its House Republican counterpart, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had just been elected president and swept a Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> into power along with him, and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats were reeling. But <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, working long hours, fought back. He worked on building a large direct mail, fund-raising list and also traveled widely across the country, beating the bushes and trying to convince businessmen and others with money that the Democrats _ not the Republicans _ were the party of the future. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> also courted the political action committees _ the PACs which control millions of dollars. He reminded them which party _ his _ controlled the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s efforts paid off. The committee began raising more money, and its candidates did well. In 1982, when the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> had been expected to make inroads into the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic margin, the Democrats picked up 26 seats. Two years later, when a popular <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was winning a second term with 59 percent of the vote, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s money helped hold <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> losses to only 15 seats. In 1986, the Democrats picked up a net of five seats and <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> was looking to move higher in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership after the retirement of popular Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, then majority leader, succeeded <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> as speaker, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> moved up to the whip's job, the third-ranking position. It put him firmly on the path to greater power. But he was brought down by ethics problems that began shortly after it was reported that he had not listed on his 1986 disclosure forms a loan he obtained to buy $ 100,000 in high-yield junk bonds. More questions were raised about that loan, even as <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> was spreading the word that he wanted to replace <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> as majority leader _ the party's second-ranking leadership position _ when <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, as expected, moved up to the speakership. <PERSON> Sisk </PERSON>, his mentor, said Saturday he was saddened by the situation. `` Basically, he and I were very close _ I guess like a son because I never had a son,'' <PERSON> Sisk </PERSON> said. `` I feel badly because I think he still had great possibilities from the standpoint of things that could develop, but it did n't work out this way. `` In the final analysis, I feel very strongly that he will prove out to be honest and dedicated. I think the time will come when he will have additional opportunities,'' <PERSON> Sisk </PERSON> said.

 When the head of the Italian Communist party visited <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> two weeks ago he did n't get to meet with any administration officials. On Saturday he got to shake hands with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Occhetto </PERSON> joined other Italian leaders in greeting the president at a glittering state dinner. Meanwhile, out on the streets of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, leftist demonstrators protesting the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit clashed with police, and 18 were detained at the central police headquarters for questioning. A band of about 50 demonstrators hurled cobblestones and fired steel balls from slingshots at riot police, who fought back with truncheons, the <ORGANIZATION> Italian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> reported. Three police officers were reported slightly injured and a 60-year-old Italian woman was hospitalized with leg and face bruises after being accidentally caught up in the melee a mile from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was meeting with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. The protest was organized by small leftist groups including the <ORGANIZATION> Proletarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> upset about plans for <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to host a unit of F-16 fighters being forced out of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The 120 guests at the black-tie dinner for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the 16th century <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> <PERSON> Madama </PERSON> included the leaders of major parties invited by Prime Minister <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat. <PERSON> Occhetto </PERSON> not only got to shake hands with the president, but was seated next to <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabb </PERSON>, wife of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took a break from fierce parliamentary debate Saturday to reassure Soviets used to empty institutional ritual that the open clash of opinions was perfectly normal. `` One need not panic,'' he told a knot of fellow parliamentarians during a recess at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies at the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s Palace of Congresses `` We can not sit ceremoniously at the meetings knowing that outside the hall there is a stormy life with a lot of problems,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. His comments were carried on national television. Soviet citizens have been keenly following the fiery proceedings in the congress, a sharp contrast to the traditional rubber-stamp practices. Lawmakers used to meet in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for only three or four days a year, unanimously pass legislation put before them by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership and deliver ovations to top officials. On Saturday legislators made statements that would have been inconceivable at an official forum even a year ago. The statements included Byelorussian writer <PERSON> Ales </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamovich </PERSON>'s claim that power in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is held not by the people but by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Even <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> fell victim to the new combativeness of Soviet parliamentarians when, in an 11th-hour move, he tried to get the congress to re-elect his protege, <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON>, to the vice presidency. Deputies objected that they were tired after three days of debate, and wanted more than one candidate to pick from. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> backed down, and the congress adjourned until Monday. In informal talks with other deputies, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said a clash of views was normal but legislators should respect those they disagree with. `` It is all right that passions are stirring,'' he said. `` When people talk about the country, the people, their fate, business, what to do to improve the situation, we have to show respect.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Soviets have been sending letters and telegrams asking `` what is the congress doing?'' `` At first glance, the work of the congress might look disorganized, deputies lacking political culture, even starting to place others in various categories,'' he said, but the newly created parliament is only beginning. `` The most important thing is to move things,'' he said.

 Arctic air plunged south from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on Saturday, bringing bitter winds and the possibility of snowfall to the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, and another cold front accompanied by showers and thunderstorms swept through the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Much of the rest of the nation, however, enjoyed sunny skies. In the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, the bitter winds were expected to bring snow to higher elevations through Sunday; and a snow advisory was posted for the Cascade Mountains of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Cloudy skies hung over much of the region early Saturday afternoon. Northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and southwestern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> were drenched with numerous showers.

<HEAD>Jewish Community Taking Court Action Over Legislator's Remarks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s Jewish community said Saturday it is taking court action against a city councilman from an ultrarightist party for reportedly saying `` Jews are plundering us again.'' The city prosecutor's office has said it is investigating legislator <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutjahr </PERSON> for possibly violating German laws with his alleged statements, printed Friday in the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> Allgemeine newspaper. In a telex to the news media on Saturday, the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> Jewish community said it was starting its own action to try to get a court to bring charges against <PERSON> Gutjahr </PERSON>, saying he had `` stirred up anti-Semitic prejudices.'' Under West German law, citizens have standing to file a complaint asking justice officials to bring someone to trial. Several members of the city council on Friday demanded the resignation of <PERSON> Gutjahr </PERSON>, a 78-year-old member of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germany </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- NPD -RRB-. The NPD, whose views are often likened to those of German neo-Nazi groups, won seven city council seats in local elections last March, giving the ultrarightist party a minority voice in the body. <PERSON> Gutjahr </PERSON> was quoted as saying, `` Jews have bought up half of the city. The Jews are plundering us again. Something must be done about this.'' The elderly councilman said he was not anti-Semitic and only wants to protect `` German interests,'' the Allgemeine reported.

 Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, whose pursuits include horse racing, got her first look Saturday at a month-old foal that she is boarding at a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> farm. The queen `` commented on how frisky and bouncy the foal was,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, the manager of <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>'s End farm. `` She remarked about how much personality the foal has.'' The queen was in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> to look at five mares she is boarding at the Lane's End and Mill Ridge farms, and to see some stallions for possible breeding. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>'s End farmhands <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Callan </PERSON> <PERSON> Strouss </PERSON> brought the young thoroughbred and <PERSON> Highclere </PERSON>, who foaled the colt on April 29, into a walking area for the queen to examine. The playful foal pranced around his mother while the queen looked on, apparently delighted. The queen patted the mare and gave her some mints. But she stayed clear of the foal. This is the third time in five years that the queen has stayed at the neatly manicured farm, located about 10 miles west of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> on gently rolling pastureland. `` I think most of us are relaxed with her being here,'' said <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>. `` Since she's a horsewoman, it's been easy being around her.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met Saturday with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> and leaders of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s caretaker government while his spokesman said flatly that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not reduce its European troop levels without consulting its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. `` In the final analysis, this is something that the president will want to discuss directly with his partners,'' <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the spokesman, said. He suggested a cutback was probable, saying he did not `` want to signal anything in advance,'' but made it clear that no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops will be withdrawn without the endorsement of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders at the summit that begins Monday in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told Prime Minister <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> that, in concert with the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies, he intends to seize on the `` openings'' offered by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for arms reductions, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The pope, meanwhile, praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his stand against narcotics, calling drug use `` a moral crisis.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he benefited from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s `` wise counsel.'' The president also said he shares the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s concern for world peace. `` We've made progress in reducing armaments,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Later, at a state dinner with <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced that Italians soon will be able to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> without obtaining visas, joining <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program giving easier entry privileges to residents of selected countries. Among the guests who shook hands with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the glittering dinner was Italian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Occhetto </PERSON>. But elsewhere, leftist demonstrators clashed with riot police in protest of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit. Three police and a woman bystander were injured, and 18 demonstrators were detained for questioning. On Monday in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, the president will meet with the leaders of the 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. Many of them are eager to have the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> match a series of weapons reductions pledged by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the latest Soviet moves, which include a willingness to impose limits on Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, presented `` some opportunities, and those are openings that need to be discussed with the allies and will be.'' The White House spokesman, in a subtle policy shift, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was now willing to negotiate over troop levels in the <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> talks being held in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Until now, the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies have tried to concentrate the talks on tanks, artillery and armored personnel carriers. The Soviets, on the other hand, have insisted on dealing directly with the levels of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, responding to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s acceptance of equal ceilings in the two alliances, said `` it's a matter for discussion.'' His comments Saturday came after reports that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was considering a reduction in the 305,000 to 325,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> took a similar tack in responding to questions about whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is preparing to lift economic sanctions imposed on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1980 after the invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` The president will be discussing a variety of ideas, many of them never presented before,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Discussing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said flatly that `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not unilaterally withdraw troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, the White House chief of staff, said in an interview to be telecast Sunday by <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> that `` You're not going to see unilateral action taken by one country or another It will be an alliance action.'' A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, meanwhile, that any action would be taken as part of the Conventional Forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> CFE </ORGANIZATION>, talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Any suggestion of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop withdrawal is bound to have an impact on the allies as they consider a West German drive _ opposed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ for negotiations to reduce ground-based nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On Saturday, West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> warned against delays in negotiating missile reductions, but <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> _ a strong supporter of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position _ argued that such cuts would be aimed at `` the jugular of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is a strong supporter of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> inside the Western alliance on most defense issues. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can not count on the Italians to side with him in opposing nuclear missile negotiations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, his two-day stop reflects strong ties with <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Accompanied by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the national security adviser, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with Prime Minister <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> at a 16th century hillside villa and then had lunch with President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> in a Wuirinale Palace hall. He announced the liberalized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> entry rules for Italians at a state dinner with the prime minister, saying, `` In the future, Italians who wish to visit our country, whether as tourists or on business, will no longer need to apply for visas, and we look forward to that day.'' His announcement prompted warm applause at the black-tie event. He also held an unscheduled meeting with <PERSON> Bettino </PERSON> <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader and prime minister from 1983 to 1987. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s audience with the Pope later at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> gave a colorful and photogenic twist to his first day in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as president <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met first with the pope in his library. The president's wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, dressed in a black suit, and more than 30 presidential aides joined them toward the end The pope praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his deep commitment `` to liberate the youth of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from the destructive forces of drug abuse and to alleviate poverty at home and abroad.'' He said these problems were `` only symptoms of a deeper moral crisis eating away at the very texture of society in almost every part of the world.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, discussing efforts for world peace, assured the pontiff, `` While we're still far from realizing the biblical injunction to turn our swords into plowshares, we've made progress in reducing armaments and in decreasing the threat of war.'' Later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told about 200 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> seminarians studying here: `` You remember the old American expression often said of a guru or individual, ` He has n't got a prayer.' Well, I am delighted to meet an audience about whom that will never be said.''

<TEXT>
 Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> arrived Saturday on a visit aimed at focusing the world's attention on foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and on the bitter fighting between Christian and Moslem forces. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said he did not come to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to negotiate on behalf of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but he would gladly meet with the hostages, even if that meant entering the Moslem sector of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` I hope that they can hear my voice or can see me or can read that the people of our country have not forgotten them. They're in our prayers,'' he said. Among the missing foreigners is Anglican church envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, who came on a mission to try to gain the release of hostages. He disappeared in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Jan. 20, 1988, after leaving his hotel for a meeting with captors of some of the victims. Before <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> arrived, Syrian gunners shelled the Christian coastline north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, despite an appeal by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders to observe a cease-fire. More than 350 people have been killed and nearly 1,400 wounded since March 8 when the latest round of fighting broke in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said the fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, in which the Christian forces are heavily outnumbered and outgunned by the Syrians and their allies, has been largely ignored by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and world media. `` This is extraordinary, that a nation is being destroyed, a religious body is being almost obliterated and an organism where so many religions lived harmoniously is being torn apart and we really have n't responded,'' he said. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who came in his role as President of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Near </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, flew in from <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, aboard a military helicopter provided by <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. The helicopter landed after sunset at the hilltop monastery of <LOCATION> Bkirki </LOCATION>, seat of <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>, nine miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>, spiritual head of the Maronite sect that has dominated the government since <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, will be <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s host during his three-day visit. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who ignored <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> objections to the trip, stopped in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Friday for talks with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II. He came to <LOCATION> Bkirki </LOCATION> with a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> passport and visa to sidestep a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ban on travel to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He told reporters in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> the pope is distressed about the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> crisis. `` I have n't seen him nearly so anguished about anything else as he is about <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` It's just eating away at him.'' Asked whether he was afraid to be in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> smiled and said: `` No I'm not. Why should I be?'' There are 15 foreigners, including nine Americans, held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Asked if he would seek to free the hostages, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who visited <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in June 1986, said: `` I'll certainly say what I said last time I was here about the American hostages and all hostages. I'm not an ambassador from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I'm simply a priest, a churchman.'' He said, `` I'm not here as a negotiator ... If their captors would permit me to see them, then I'd be very happy to see them and do anything I could to help them.'' Asked whether he would cross <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line to the Moslem sector, where most of the hostages are believed held, the cardinal said: `` I'll be going to wherever Patriarch <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON> thinks I should go.'' Officials said <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was scheduled to drive to west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to meet with acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads a Moslem Cabinet vying for legitimacy with a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> government headed by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. The cardinal was scheduled to meet Sunday with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> at the shell-battered presidential palace in <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, five miles east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

 Soccer fans clashed Saturday in the city center and the streets surrounding a <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> stadium before, during and after a game between <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and police reported more than 250 arrests. The annual England-Scotland game, the oldest rivalry in international soccer, often has been the setting for fan violence in recent years. Police in <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> had expected problems and made special plans for controlling hooliganism surrounding the game. `` There were clashes between rival groups and police stepped in quickly to quell any disturbances and make arrests,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Strathclyde </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Howden </PERSON>. `` We generally have kept on top of things.'' <ORGANIZATION> Howden </ORGANIZATION> said about 100 fans were arrested before the match at <LOCATION> Hampden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> stadium, mostly for minor offenses. There were no serious injuries reported, he said, and the only report of property damage was of a broken pub window. Police later reported more than 150 related arrests in the city center. Soccer hooliganism, a persistent problem for years, has become particularly sensitive recently with the involvement of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> fans in the May 29, 1985 <LOCATION> Heysel </LOCATION> stadium riots in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, in which 39 people were killed. On April 15, 95 fans were killed at <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> stadium when police permitted shoving fans into an already crowded standing area, creating a fatal crush.

 Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> ended his two-year command of the USS Vincennes on Saturday without apology for the cruiser's mistaken destruction of an Iranian airliner and with a call to combat terrorism. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> took over as the new commander of the Aegis cruiser that <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> defended as `` a masterpiece of American technology and ingenuity,'' despite past criticisms. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> made no mention of the airliner's destruction July 3, 1988, instead focusing on a pipe bomb attack last March that destroyed a van driven by his wife, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, as she drove to work. Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> escaped injury. The van bombing remains under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> as a possible act of terrorism. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, speaking to a crowd of about 200 aboard the heavily guarded ship, denounced terrorism, saying it is a `` subterranean and shadowy war'' that `` preys on a lack of courage and enlists those without moral conviction.'' The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was engaged in combat with seven Iranian patrol craft when it misidentified the Iranian jetliner as an attacking military aircraft and fired at it. All 290 aboard the jet died. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who took command of the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> in April 1987, defended the Aegis electronic combat control system, which enables a ship like the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> to make computer-recommended battle decisions for entire fleets. But the system was found flawed in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> confrontation. According to Pentagon analysts, split-second decisions were affected by the inability of radar-scope interpreters to immediately match the plane's `` blip'' with digital direction, altitude and speed information displayed on another screen. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> will be moved to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shipyard </LOCATION> within five weeks for modifications of its electronic combat control system, The -LRB- <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported. During the ceremony, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was commended by Vice Adm. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K.U </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kihune </PERSON>, who presented him with the Legion of Merit. `` There are very few officers in our ranks who have been faced with the challenges of command that Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> has had to face,'' <PERSON> Kihune </PERSON> said. `` I can state today, without any exaggeration, that Capt. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> has met every test and has moved on to instill pride in his men and to command his warship with true professionalism.,'' <PERSON> Kihune </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>' new assignment is at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION>, which trains senior naval officers in handling close-combat situations. He and his wife are under a <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> guard that has been in place since the van bombing. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, which was commissioned in 1984, is expected to leave <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> for a routine six-month deployment to the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> in early December.

 Thousands of Moslems on Saturday fought among themselves and clashed with police during a march to demand <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> change its blasphemy laws and allow them to challenge `` The Satanic Verses'' in court. Police said 84 people were arrested and six policemen were injured during the march, most in street battles in front of the Houses of Parliament. An estimated 20,000 demonstrators waved banners denouncing author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and shouted slogans such as `` <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> must die!'' as they began their march in <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. An effigy of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> hanging from gallows was thrust high into the air. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a British author, wrote `` The Satanic Verses,'' a novel that some say is insulting to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>. Lawmaker <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaz </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his publisher, <PERSON> Penguin </PERSON>, to withdraw the novel from circulation in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, home to an estimated 850,000 Moslems. Protesters then marched to Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s office at 10 Downing St., where representatives handed in a petition demanding a change in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s ancient blasphemy laws <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s rarely used blasphemy law makes it illegal only to insult the Christian state Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Moslems want it extended to reflect <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s multi-ethnic society, saying this would give them legal grounds for opposing `` The Satanic Verses.'' At their next stop in Parliament Square, thousands of protesters stood under <PERSON> Big </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> and blocked traffic as fighting broke out among crowd members. Riot police poured into the area to break up the clashes and force protesters onto <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, out of the square. A <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard spokesman said fighting broke out among younger members of the demonstration `` for reasons best known to themselves.'' He said the demonstrators refused to move but then resumed the march after protest organizers announced over a loudspeaker that police had assured them the arrested people would be released. After the skirmishes the protesters continued their march to their final destination in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennington </LOCATION> where they dispersed. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, born to a Moslem family in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, is a British citizen and has been in hiding in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> since Feb. 14, when Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> ordered Moslems to kill him. Moslems say `` The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by associating the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> with prostitutes and suggesting that the Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book, was <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s invention, not the work of God. At the start of Saturday's protest, Moslem men sat in circles on the grass in <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and punched the air with their fists as they called for the British government to change the blasphemy law. The International Committee For The Defense of <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and His Publishers issued a statement calling on demonstration leaders to repudiate <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death threat. The statement said the death threat violated international law and contradicted `` the principle of reverence for life which underlies all religions.'' The committee agreed with the demonstrators that the blasphemy law discriminated against Moslems and other non-Christians but said it should be repealed rather than extended. The protest was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem leader <PERSON> Abdal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Choudhury </PERSON>.

 The baggage area for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1098 was swarming with passengers, but there was no mistaking the man of the hour _ <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Infante </PERSON>, who served as interpreter Saturday when their plane was hijacked. `` He's a hero!'' one of his fellow passengers shouted. Surrounded by reporters, the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> man smiled modestly and remained unruffled as he did throughout the hijacking. `` He was great,'' agreed <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Saghian </PERSON>, a ladies fashion salesman from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Infante </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON> sat patiently while her husband, a 33-year-old sales representative for <ORGANIZATION> Minolta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, told his story again and again. `` I thought I was n't going to get home,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Infante </PERSON>, who with her husband was returning from a company-paid vacation in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` The beginning was pretty difficult because we did n't know where we were standing. All they would say was the individual wanted to go to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Infante </PERSON>, 28, said she was proud of her husband's behavior as he relayed messages between the crew and the Spanish-speaking hijacker, identified by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Comas-Banos </PERSON>, an escaped mental patient who emigrated from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in the Mariel boatlift. `` I thought he handled it very good, kept himself calm,'' she said. `` I think that if he would have been tense, it would have made it worse.'' She said <PERSON> Infante </PERSON> persuaded the man to release children from the plane and tried to get him to let the women go _ or at least his own wife. Comas-Banos allowed children the leave the parked <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, and <PERSON> Infante </PERSON> and other negotiators talked him into surrendering minutes later. <PERSON> Infante </PERSON> offered to accompany the man from the plane, but the crew would n't allow it. <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Anyia </PERSON>, a high school math teacher in <LOCATION> Hawthorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, sat across from <PERSON> Infante </PERSON> and Comas-Banos and said the hijacker did n't act strangely. `` I dismissed him almost from the moment we took off,'' he said, adding, `` <PERSON> Eli </PERSON>, he was great.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Infante </PERSON> said she and her husband would pick up their two small sons at her sister-in-law's house, then go home and rest. `` Thank God it's a long weekend,'' she said. When asked if she would fly again, she laughed and replied, `` It'll be a long time.''

 A Cuban immigrant who escaped from a mental hospital tried to hijack an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> on Saturday, but he surrendered after the plane landed at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, authorities said. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 carrying 157 passengers and crew en route from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> was diverted toward <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> temporarily before heading back to its original destination. The hijacker was armed with a starter's pistol and two knives, but no one was injured. He was identified as <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Comas-Banos </PERSON>, 37, who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> exactly nine years ago Saturday as part of the Mariel boatlift, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON>. The suspect has a history of mental problems, most recently escaping from an institution in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said, adding that the date of that escape is not yet known. `` He has been living since that time in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area and reportedly has a son in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and has expressed interest in returning to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said. Before going to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Comas-Banos </ORGANIZATION> escaped from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeths </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>, who attempted to assassinate President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981, is held. Comas-Banos was there from 1980 to 1982. `` He's a very confused individual, not at all crystal clear and cogent,'' <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said. `` His mind keeps changing.'' Dressed in olive-drab fatigues and a bomber-type jacket, the sandy-haired <ORGANIZATION> Comas-Banos </ORGANIZATION> boarded an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Saturday morning and then transferred to the Miami-bound flight in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said. `` After the flight left the ground on its way to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, he produced a demand note and said he wanted to be taken to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said. Speaking only Spanish, the hijacker told the flight crew he was carrying a bomb in his briefcase, which actually contained a starter's pistol used in track races, two pocket knives and a pair of scissors. The pilot turned back toward <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> after reporting he did n't have enough fuel to get to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said was true ` There was no bluff here this morning,'' <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said. The plane never entered Cuban airspace. Ninety minutes after Flight 1098 parked in a remote corner of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Comas-Banos </ORGANIZATION> allowed children to leave the jet and then gave himself up, <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said. `` All the passengers are off and safe,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>. Comas-Banos was charged with air piracy and taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> pending a hearing Tuesday before a federal magistrate, <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said. If convicted, <ORGANIZATION> Comas-Banos </ORGANIZATION> faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. One passenger, <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Infante </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said he served as interpreter between the hijacker and crew. `` I thought I was going to get shot,'' <PERSON> Infante </PERSON> said. Asked why <PERSON> Comas-Banos </PERSON> gave up, <PERSON> Infante </PERSON> said, `` I guess he got tired. We kept telling him we would not take off with passengers aboard.'' <PERSON> Infante </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON>, 28, described Comas-Banos as `` very tense. He was sweating a lot and walking back and forth saying he had accomplices. But we never saw anybody but him.'' Describing Comas-Banos' surrender, Mrs. <PERSON> Infante </PERSON> said `` he collapsed and everybody jumped on him'' as he left the back of the jet. At one point, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and the airline had said there might be more than one hijacker, but they said later that that was never confirmed. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, senior vice president of operations at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, said the hijacker claimed to have confederates aboard the plane, and the other passengers were being interviewed and the plane checked for weapons. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said passengers left the aircraft by rear stairs, and their carry-on luggage was checked by officers with police dogs. Flight 1098, carrying 150 passengers and a crew of seven, left <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> about 8 a.m. EDT and was scheduled to land at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> at about 10:30 a.m. `` Approximately 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> ... the pilot reported he had a passenger who wanted to go to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckhorn </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The aircraft circled <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for approximately 20 minutes and then turned south. Approximately 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the aircraft turned north again,'' <PERSON> Buckhorn </PERSON> said. The Coast Guard was notified of an air emergency shortly before 11 a.m. as the jet flew over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Ditching `` was a concern at one point in time,'' said law enforcement duty officer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police sent a special-weapons and tactics team to the airport, and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was on the scene. During the 1960s and 1970s, there were a rash of hijackings or attempted hijackings to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> before the institution of security measures at airports and the cooperation of Cuban authorities stemmed the tide. Last December, a Cuban exile tried to hijack a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> on a flight from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, but the aircraft landed on <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> instead with the hijacker thinking he was on the ground in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>.

 Several thousand disappointed Muscovites gathered in a stadium parking lot Saturday night and denounced the rejection by the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of reform candidates who ran for seats in the standing legislature. Many people in the crowd shouted slogans supporting maverick Communist <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>. `` The majority of the people is for the minority of the deputies,'' one banner said. Another placard said: `` But is it really life, if it's in chains? But is it really an election, if it's in fetters?'' <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON>, a teacher, said he sent a telegram to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> telling him, `` I have less and less respect for you and more and more'' for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s reform deputies. He was applauded when he told the crowd, `` Down with the bloodsuckers who prey on the people!'' `` Now we see we ca n't set our hopes on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> or on the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' another speaker told the rally, which went on past midnight. In nationwide balloting last spring and scores of runoff elections, 2,250 members were elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> On Saturday the deputies elected members to the full-time, 542-seat Supreme Soviet legislature. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and other prominent <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> reformers were defeated. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s handling of Saturday's session drew comments from people at the rally. `` Did you see how <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> led the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>? Like a conductor, waggling his fingers,'' one man said. When an organizer asked the crowd to behave more `` ethically'' and stop trying to grab the microphone a woman said, `` What about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s ` ethical' behavior?'' A member of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which helped organize the rally, said he was disgusted when he saw the list of deputies elected to the Supreme Soviet. `` They're all the familiar faces I've been seeing for the last two years,'' he said. `` What prevented them two years ago from making the reforms they're supposed to start doing now? The rally, held in the Luzhniki sports complex, was approved by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> authorities as a gathering for public expressions on the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Police did not intervene and an organizer said authorities even offered the use of a public address system.

 House Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said Saturday the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were not `` in a crisis'' despite the ethics controversies that have ensnared Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> congressman said he tried to persuade <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, who as majority whip is the No. 3 House Democrat, not to resign from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because of a pending ethics investigation into personal finances. But he said his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> colleague told him his decision to quit was irreversible. `` There is an environment of very intense scrutiny and focus on us,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> told reporters as he shook hands during the annual Old Mill Days parade in <LOCATION> Oakesdale </LOCATION>, about 45 miles south of <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>. `` In recent weeks and months, the focus has been so intense, it has created a mood ... that I hope will soon change to focus on the legislative issues,'' said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, who is favored to succeed <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> should the speaker resign as expected next week. `` I hope the focus of the media will come back to those issues for which we were elected to undertake.'' The 13-term congressman, who later was keynote speaker at a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> fund-raiser in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, said the ethics issues have not hurt the Democrats or <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are not in a crisis. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are not in a crisis,'' he told reporters. `` We're going to address ourselves to the legislative issues that face the country. `` We'll resolve the leadership issues very soon and we'll go on and have a very important and meaningful <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. He noted <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, who had been expected to be a candidate to replace <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> as majority leader, continued to deny he had violated any House ethics standards. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> has `` had a brilliant record as chairman of the campaign committee and as the party whip, and I think he'll be deeply missed by his colleagues and by the constituents he served so well,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> told colleagues late Friday that he intends to resign from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> next month rather than endure a protracted ethics investigation. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> has come under criticism for his personal business dealings, particularly the handling of a $ 100,000 investment in junk bonds.

 <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jianjun </PERSON>, one of thousands of students waiting Saturday at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s railroad station to go home, said it was time to bring the spirit of the demonstrations that have convulsed the capital out to the countryside. `` Participation of the people will help bring about a new government,'' <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said after spending four days marching and chanting anti-government slogans at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s central Tiananmen Square. But, he conceded, `` the conditions are really bad at the square. A lot of people are tired of living out there.'' As he and others prepared to leave, hundreds of students were arriving at the station. Soldiers blocked many from leaving the station to go to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, a junior at the <ORGANIZATION> Liaoning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fuxing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, said he was not discouraged that the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> demonstrations appeared to be coming to an end, with only about 10,000 protesters remaining in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> Saturday compared to hundreds of thousands a week ago. `` People from my school are still at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>, and many of us return to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> after going home to continue our movement,'' <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said. But he added that the journey back and forth is `` getting hard now with all the soldiers at this station.'' Demonstrations have been reported in many cities, apparently led by students who returned home after participating in the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> protests. `` We have to tell the people to arise, including peasants, workers, intellectuals and others from every walk of life,'' said a 24-year-old student from <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION> who asked not to be identified. On Saturday, several dozen soldiers kept crowds of students in a waiting area outside the station for a long trip back by special train to <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Several dozen more plainclothes soldiers wearing red armbands made a ring around the departing students _ making sure they did not stray back into the city. `` Soldiers have blocked the exits to keep students from getting out -LRB- of the station -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiongdong </PERSON>, a junior at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> who was seeing friends off <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said guards scuffled with five students from <ORGANIZATION> Suzhou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> earlier Saturday, tearing their shirts while hauling them away to be sent back to eastern <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> province. `` If a big group arrives -LRB- from the countryside -RRB- the soldiers wo n't try to stop them, but if it's just a handful, they wo n't get through,'' he said. The government has issued orders to provincial officials to stop students from coming to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. During the peak of the demonstrations, some 50,000 students arrived by train daily, according to newspapers. State-run radio reported 26,000 students left <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Friday. Railroad officials declined to answer questions about the situation Saturday. Railroad workers have allowed many students to ride the trains free to join the demonstrators at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>, but that too is to end. Loudspeakers at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> station said that starting Sunday, all students would have to pay for their trips.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> picked up about 50,000 new members Saturday and its chief rival in the health care field an estimated 27,000 as a smaller but aggressive union dissolved to join the ranks of labor's giants. <ORGANIZATION> SEIU </ORGANIZATION> immediately claimed preeminence in the burgeoning health care industry but its rival, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, vowed to continue its organizing forays in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy.

Results of an election supervised by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arbitration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and released Saturday showed 13 of the District 1199's 18 locals chose to join <ORGANIZATION> SEIU </ORGANIZATION> That would swell the union's membership from 850,000 to about 900,000 Five of the locals, with a total of about 27,300 members, voted to join <ORGANIZATION> AFSCME </ORGANIZATION>, which entered the election 1.2 million members strong. The results left <ORGANIZATION> SEIU </ORGANIZATION> representing about 375,000 health-care workers to about 330,000 for <ORGANIZATION> AFSCME </ORGANIZATION>. District 1199 Secretary Treasurer <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who sided with <ORGANIZATION> SEIU </ORGANIZATION> in the affiliation fight, said the election was `` but the opening salvo in a battle to organize all health care workers into one great union.'' Added <ORGANIZATION> SEIU </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>: `` We come out of this with a lot of energy to turn to the question of unorganized workers.'' But an <ORGANIZATION> AFSCME </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <ORGANIZATION> SEIU </ORGANIZATION> would face continued competition in organizing the estimated 6 million health care workers not currently represented by unions. `` We're very pleased to have gotten those votes, to have gained those members that we have,'' said <ORGANIZATION> AFSCME </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Harman </PERSON>. `` That means we're a very potent health care union too and we intend to remain so.'' The election took on added significance because of a recent <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> decision unions believe will make it easier to organize health care workers. The two larger unions were unable to resolve differences over how an affiliation vote would be conducted so the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> brokered a compromise under which each local of the health care union decided which of the bigger unions to join. That decision essentially guaranteed District 1199 would be split up because <ORGANIZATION> AFSCME </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> SEIU </ORGANIZATION> had concentrated their lobbying efforts in different regions and were competing head-to-head in only a few. <ORGANIZATION> SEIU </ORGANIZATION> emerged victorious in two of the hardest fought battles, gaining 5,000 members in the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> area and another 2,500 in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. It also won the affiliation of District 1199 members in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> _ except for one <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> local _ <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> except <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AFSCME </ORGANIZATION>'s wins included the two largest District 1199 locals, a 10,500-member unit in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and one representing 10,000 workers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. About 5,200 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> nurses picked <ORGANIZATION> AFSCME </ORGANIZATION> over <ORGANIZATION> SEIU </ORGANIZATION> as did one District 1199 local in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and another representing workers in several Southern states.

 An 18-year-old man accused of murdering his parents escaped with another prisoner from a northwestern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> jail early Saturday. <LOCATION> Washburn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said late Saturday afternoon that investigators had found no sign as yet of <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON>, who is scheduled for trial Oct. 2 in the shooting deaths of his parents. `` We've been following a lot of leads,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. He said law enforcement agencies throughout <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and surrounding states were alerted of the escape, and the search would continue Saturday night. `` All they had on was jail coveralls and small sandals _ almost barefoot,'' the sheriff said. `` Whether they were picked up outside, we just do n't know.'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said the two, who had been cellmates since the other escapee was jailed May 13, used hacksaw blades to saw through the bars of an outside window. The sheriff said it was not known how they obtained the cutting device, although it was possible to pass things into the jail through windows. `` We're dealing with a 100-year-old jail here,'' he said. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said <PERSON> York </PERSON>, 18, of rural <PERSON> Spooner </PERSON>, who was being held on two counts of first-degree murder, and <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 17, of <LOCATION> Trego </LOCATION>, held on a burglary charge and a probation violation, escaped sometime after 2 a.m. <PERSON> York </PERSON> was accused of the Sept. 8, 1988, slayings of his parents, <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON>, both 49, in their home about two miles northwest of <PERSON> Spooner </PERSON>. Authorities said each had been shot once in the head with a rifle. The criminal complaint filed in the case contends <PERSON> York </PERSON> got into a quarrel with his parents after he and his father returned home from a carpentry job. York had been freed on a $ 100,000 cash bond after being charged. He was put in the custody of relatives in northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, but did not maintain required contact with authorities and was arrested in March on a bail jumping charge.

The alleged law school plagiarism involved an essay <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> wrote in 1965 for an introductory class on legal methodology. The senator ended his presidential campaign Sept. 23, 1987, and notified the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of the plagiarism allegations later that year.

 <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s president on Friday asked former Premier <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Spadolini </PERSON> to try to mediate an end to a week-old political crisis that seemed likely to continue beyond President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s three-day visit Premier <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION>, resigned as the head of a 13-month government last Friday after repeated attacks by the Socialists, one of his allies in the five-party coalition. A few hours before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s arrival Friday, President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Spadolini </PERSON> to talk with party leaders and find a way to solve the crisis brought on <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION>'s resignation. <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON>, as head of state, is charged with picking someone to try to form <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s 49th postwar government. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> had sought to have <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> succeed himself as premier. That would have enhanced <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION>'s position in talks with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit next week in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. But there have been indications Socialist leader <PERSON> Bettino </PERSON> <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON> was opposed to another De Mita-led government. <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON> has accused <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> of failing to demonstrate leadership. <PERSON> Spadolini </PERSON> said after his meeting with <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> that he would begin his consultations on Wednesday after <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> returns from <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. His appointment as mediator marked the ninth time that an Italian president has given a prominent politician the so-called `` exploratory mandate'' for resolving a government crisis. <PERSON> Spadolini </PERSON>, 63, was premier from June 28, 1981, until Aug. 7, 1982 and from Aug. 23, 1982 until Nov. 11, 1982.

<TEXT>
 A graduate student has sued the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> claiming that its new anti-discrimination policy violates his First Amendment right to free speech. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> filed the complaint Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> on behalf of a graduate student in psychology, who wished to remain anonymous. The university introduced the policy in 1988 in response to a series of racial incidents that included the broadcast of racially offensive jokes on a campus radio station in 1987 and distribution of anti-black leaflets. The plaintiff is a specialist in behavioral psychology and fears punishment if he discusses some of his theories in class, said <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedler </PERSON> said. `` Under the university's policy ... the expression of ideas concerning the superiority or inferiority of members of one sex over the other or of members of one race over another, as a result of biopsychological differences, would be considered to be ` discriminatory harassment,''' the complaint said. The Policy on Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment by Students in the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> prohibits `` any behavior, verbal or physical, that stigmatizes or victimizes an individual on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, creed, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, handicap or Vietnam-era veteran status.'' The case would have important implications for other schools that have anti-discrimination policies, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> at Madison and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> are considering introducing anti-discrimination plans. `` Our suit may serve as an important precedent,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` If we can prevail and redirect the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to deal with racism and sexism, it will have an influential effect on other universities. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, executive director of university relations, said <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> has always sought to preserve First Amendment rights. `` When we crafted the anti-discrimination policy, we gave careful consideration to the First Amendment, which we consider to be essential to the successful operation of the university,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> officials called the policy excessively broad, making any offensive speech the target of disciplinary action. `` You do not address the problem of racism by attacking the Constitution and the First Amendment,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` If there is any institution in the country where controversial, in fact outrageous and even offensive, ideas ought to be aired, analyzed, evaluated and debated, it ought to be a university.'' The policy addresses only the symptoms and not the disease of racism, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` If all the racist fliers and jokes and sexually offensive fliers or jokes are eliminated from the campus of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, that does not mean racism and sexism will be eliminated,'' he said. The university has 30 days to respond to the lawsuit, <PERSON> Sedler </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has been hit by a series of strikes in recent months recalling the pre-Thatcher days of national walkouts that helped bring down a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government.

Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ousted the socialists in May 1979 on a wave of anti-union sentiment Experts predict the strikes will eventually subside after a current round of wage negotiations. Although there are concerns the walkouts could lead to higher wages and prices, their impact will be limited by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s union-curbing laws, they say. Repeated one-day walkouts by subway workers and bus drivers have forced millions of Londoners to walk to work.

 There is a glimmer of hope as <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and union negotiators race against a contract deadline at midnight tonight, but little progress is reported on the issue of health benefits, described by one source as `` the major block to a settlement.'' Both sides are expressing optimism at reaching new contracts before existing pacts affecting about 160,000 workers expire at 11:59 p.m. EDT. But they say such a development hinges on a major breakthrough on the benefits package, which has dominated the talks from the outset. `` If we can settle health care _ no easy task _ then we can reach agreement on wages and the other issues,'' a union source said late Friday. `` This is the major block to a settlement.''
