<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> said Monday night he will extend a year-old inflation-fighting program through the first half of 1989, institute a gradual peso devaluation and allow an 8 percent pay increase for workers. The increase will be the workers' first in nine months. In a Monday night ceremony with business and labor leaders, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> also gave the program a new name: the Economic Growth and Stability Pact. Former President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> implemented the plan, then known as the Economic Solidarity Pact, in December 1987 as inflation reached a record annual rate of 159.2 percent. Inflation reached 48.6 percent for the first 11 months of 1988, according to the central bank. The central features of the plan included freezes enacted Feb. 29 on the peso currency exchange rate and on prices for government-regulated goods and services. The government also froze the daily minimum wage, which in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> amounted to about $ 3.70. On Jan. 1, the government will begin adjusting the peso-dollar exchange rate by an average of one peso per day through July 31, 1989, the statement said. It said the controlled devaluation will occur `` at a rhythm that continues to make possible for those making their investments in pesos a better yield than that obtained using other currencies.'' The measure will be implemented `` without abandoning the objective of stabilizing the exchange rate during the year,'' the statement added.

<HEAD>Soldiers To Get 20 Percent Pay Raise This Month, Plus Bonus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The armed forces will receive pay raises of 20 percent in December with a $ 100 bonus, an official report said Monday. Soldiers who mounted a four-day uprising this month had demanded raises. The government's news agency, <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION>, cited `` reliable sources'' for its report of the raises. It gave no details in its two-paragraph story. The military uprising broke out at a base on the outskirts of the capital on Dec. 1 and moved to another base nearby before the mutineers agreed to return to their units. The revolt left three people dead. Civilian President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> denied reports at the time that he was forced to make concessions in exchange for the surrender of the rebellious troops. Soldiers have complained that they _ like other public employees _ have lost significant purchasing power as raises failed to keep pace with increases in the cost of living. The military received a 30 percent raise in July and 12 percent in October. The cost of living rose by 26 percent in July and 9 percent in October. The latest raise would be well ahead of inflation, which last month increased by 6 percent. The government has tried to control military salaries partly in an effort to harness inflation. In addition, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has blocked the 1988 budget because it wants more federal funds for the provinces. The military share of the total budget has shrunk to about 2 percent of gross domestic product from about 4 percent during military dictatorships of 1976-83.

 A convict dubbed the `` traveling rapist'' received a stay of execution late Monday for the rape-murder of a 19-year-old woman, but a second man was still slated to be put to death by injection early Tuesday for the killing of a restaurateur. The high court granted an application for a stay of execution for <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> late Monday, hours after turning down a similar request from <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>, whose execution was still scheduled for after midnight. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Arberg </PERSON> said the application was filed at 9:30 p.m. EST and the order sparing <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> was entered at 10:25 p.m. with Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> dissenting. He was sentenced to death for the 1976 rape-slaying of a 19-year-old woman. Earlier Monday, the nation's high court voted 7-2 to refuse the appeal filed by lawyers for <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>, 39, a native of <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, who was convicted of killing a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> restaurant owner during a robbery. Since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 allowed capital punishment to resume, no state has executed two inmates in a single day, although two inmates, and in one case three, have been executed on the same day in separate states. Before Tuesday's scheduled executions, 28 inmates, including two this year, had been put to death by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> prison officials since 1976. The tally is the highest of any state. Before the issuance of a stay, the two were to be executed in the same death chamber, with <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> scheduled first. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, 45, faced injection for the rape and stabbing death of <PERSON> Abbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <PERSON> Borger </PERSON>, who was killed after <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> entered her apparently unlocked home. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' case Monday went to the 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> after a federal district judge in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Halbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>, reversed a stay he issued Friday. State attorneys had appealed his action. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> also has a second death sentence for the abduction and slaying of a 12-year-old Amarillo girl. He has been dubbed the `` traveling rapist'' after admitting to some 40 rapes, prosecutors said. <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON>, bypassed lower federal courts and had appealed directly to the high court. <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>, a former electrician, was sentenced for the shooting death of <PERSON> Kosmas </PERSON> <PERSON> Prittis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Prittis </PERSON>, 33, a Greek immigrant, was robbed of more than $ 2,300 and fatally shot in the head while he and his family were closing their restaurant. Last January, <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> came within three hours of execution before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> issued a stay. In appeals for each inmate, defense attorneys cited a case pending before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> involving <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> death row inmate <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Penry </PERSON>. That case challenges the legality of executing mentally retarded inmates. `` This man is n't retarded,'' assistant attorney general <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>. `` I do n't think that's going to fly with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>, an 11th-grade dropout, has a lengthy criminal record, including arrests for sexual assault and abuse of a juvenile, assault, family neglect and petty larceny.

 More than a dozen flights were delayed at <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> when a man broke into a control room and disconnected hundreds of fuses from the air traffic control system, police said today. The incident cut communications between airport controllers and flights using the airport for about 40 minutes on Sunday, said a local police official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Six departures and 11 arrivals were delayed for up to half an hour. Police arrested a 26-year-old man they described only as a professional golfer. The official said the man may have entered the closely guarded communications control center when employees were at lunch. Police using a duplicate key entered and overpowered the man, who shouted that he was acting `` at the guidance of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>,'' the official said. His identity was withheld pending investigation of his mental health.

 More than twice the number of minority high school students took advancement placement exams in 1988 than five years ago, led by a surge among Hispanics and Asian-Americans, the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported. The board's annual survey of advanced placement tests, which high school students take to qualify for credit or placement in upper-level college courses, also found that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> had by far the most black and Hispanic test-takers who scored qualifying grades. In all, 288,372 students took 419,101 advanced placement exams in 1988. The program, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, offers 27 college-level examinations in 16 subjects. Nearly 52,000 minority students nationwide took the exams in 1988, compared with 39,517 in 1987, and 142 percent more than the 21,501 who took it five years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. Forty-nine thousand of those students scored high enough to qualify for college credit. The tests are scored on a scale of 1-5, with colleges usually requiring at least a 3 to qualify for credit. Minority students made up nearly 20 percent of all advanced placement test-takers in 1988, compared with 18.4 percent in 1987 and 14.7 percent in 1984. `` By using AP to raise the expectations of minority students and helping them achieve higher goals ... schools are bringing more minorities into professional and graduate schools,'' said board president <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. The number of Asian-American students taking the exams was 27,396, up from 21,101 in 1987 and 140 percent greater than the 11,413 in 1984. The number of Hispanics taking the test grew 156 percent over five years: from 5,200 to 13,322; the number of blacks grew by 135 percent, from 4,448 to 10,448. The number of whites taking the tests totaled 210,582, up 27 percent from 165,924 in 1987, and 80 percent higher than the 117,302 in 1984. Some 8,247 schools offered the exams in 1988, 470 more than last year. <ORGANIZATION> Plano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, with a student body of 2,600, had the largest number of advanced placement candidates of any school _ 490 _ and the largest number of tests taken _ 887, according to the report. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> led the nation with 5,125 black and Hispanic test-takers last year. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was second with 2,526, followed by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with 2,439. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is a nonprofit organization representing 2,600 colleges and other educational groups.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> is campaigning doggedly to improve <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s image overseas, but he faces constant reminders that success will be limited until he comes to terms with <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. Among those conveying that message in recent days were <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s best-known novelist, black and white corporate executives, and two leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators who were rebuffed curtly when they asked <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> if they could meet the jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader. Even the government's recent decision to transfer <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> to a prison farm staff house, complete with swimming pool and patio, seemed to underscore the special stature of the 70-year-old black nationalist. `` They are showing that he is the major kingpin in the constitutional future of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalling </PERSON>, parliament member from the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Perhaps the most dramatic evidence of the influence wielded over <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> came in court testimony last week on behalf of 11 black activists about to be sentenced for treason and terrorism in the same courthouse where <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> received a life sentence for sabotage in 1964. Most of the 11 treason defendants were affiliated to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a nationwide anti-apartheid coalition which the trial judge said had collaborated with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. The defense lawyers, instead of repudiating the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, summoned several of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most respected opposition figures to speak about their support for and understanding of the outlawed guerrilla movement. <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordimer </PERSON>, the country's foremost novelist, said she considered <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> her leader and blamed her fellow whites for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s political violence. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Motsuenyane </PERSON>, a black bank chairman, said of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>: `` Unquestionably, he is my hero.'' Similar statements came from a university administrator and the leader of a black homeland. In a subsequent magazine interview, a prominent Afrikaner business leader, <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON>, said he wanted to meet <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> `` man to man'' to discuss a peaceful political settlement. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has declined to spell out his plans for <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> as he presses ahead with an unprecedented campaign to ease international pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In the past few weeks, he has commuted the widely denounced death sentences of a group of blacks known as the <ORGANIZATION> Sharpeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION>, freed two elderly black political prisoners and endorsed a tentative peace plan that could end South African rule over <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. All these steps, as well as <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s transfer, have been welcomed in Western capitals. But always, the pressure to deal politically with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> resumes. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> also is under fire for continued repression of dissidents at home while he tries to impress power brokers abroad. Even a seemingly benevolent gesture, the recent release of detained black newspaper editor <PERSON> Zwelakhe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, had a harsh edge to it. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, like several other freed detainees, was prohibited from returning to his job, restricted to the area around his home and barred from anti-government political activity. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Senators <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, at the close of a one-week fact-finding trip, acknowledged Saturday that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> had taken some positive steps but said they came away with a feeling of pessimism. `` If those who are working for real change are foreclosed from using non-violent political methods, it is our great fear that they will be forced to turn to methods that will undoubtedly lead to violence and tragedy,'' the two Democrats said. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, `` deeply disappointed us by wanting to talk only about the past, not trying to engage and assess and share ideas about the future.'' Even if <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> were released, opposition leaders say the gesture would mean little unless he and other prominent black militants, young and old, are allowed to engage freely in politics and to work for a one-person, one-vote system. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> says he is not willing to even discuss such a system, and there is no sign that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release would mean an easing of restrictions on opposition activity.

The center said it expected to get $ 30,000 to $ 35,000. `` It's not something that's happened to us before, coming to a town which has a family in it which was the inspiration for our film,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> told the 600 people attending a dinner following the premiere. `` It's just a very moving experience for myself and my wife, and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> and his wife, and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> and his wife. `` We just made a film that's going to play for, you know, a month or two, or whatever, in cities in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and around the world and be put out on -LRB- video -RRB- cassette and put on shelves and seen once. `` You people have <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> in your community for the rest of your lives, and I would take that any day of the week, and I think that's a really important thing because he is a very special person who shines through this ... magic he has. Autism is an affliction in which the brain does n't process information correctly. Some autistics are self-abusive and lack social skills but excel in music, math and art. Generally, though, autism is misunderstood, said Mrs. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` I had people say, ` Is n't it nice your little boy knows how to draw,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> gave the movie credit for advancing knowledge of autism, telling <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, `` You have done with one film what we have been trying to do in our field for 25 years.'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said, however, `` If we do one-tenth of what Mrs. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> has done, we will have made a little advance.''

 <PERSON> Leanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, a 16-year-old Protestant, had never met a Roman Catholic until she went to a memorial service for the victims of an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombing and ended up holding hands with two nuns. That moment at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anne </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, when the minister asked everyone in the overflowing congregation to join hands and pray, marked a turning point in <PERSON> Leanne </PERSON>'s life. She had been crying for the 11 people killed in <LOCATION> Enniskillen </LOCATION> on Nov. 8, 1987 and was so wrapped up in the service she did n't realize she had picked up the hands of two nuns who were sitting beside her. `` I went home and I thought, ` I'm just really fed up that I have to hate this woman because she's wearing a nun's habit, I have to hate this fellow because he's a Catholic.' It just went over and over in my mind, you know, what am I going to do?,'' she said. `` I'd never met any Catholics, never, never. ... My mom and dad are very good, they really are. They did n't keep me away from Catholics. It's just where I lived there were n't any,'' she said. In <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, with its history of sectarian animosities, it is common for youngsters, and even adults, never to have met someone of another religion. Many of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s 1 million Protestants and 600,000 Catholics live in neighborhoods segregated along religious lines, and all but 1,000 of the province's 350,000 children attend schools that are almost entirely Protestant or Catholic. <PERSON> Leanne </PERSON> is studying for college entrance exams at mainly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grosvenor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in east <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. After the <LOCATION> Enniskillen </LOCATION> memorial service, she decided to try to arrange an exchange with a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> high school. `` I never thought it would be anything big, just a small meeting,'' <PERSON> Leanne </PERSON> said. `` I was a very quiet person ... but something inside of me said, ` I think you should really advertise this,' and before I knew what I was saying, I asked ... if I could -LRB- address -RRB- the school assembly. `` Well, I went and did that assembly, and they clapped and they clapped and I was just shocked. I did n't think anybody felt the same way I did. And there were hundreds of them. ... They said this is the right thing we're doing.'' The first exchange late last year was with a group of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> students from two schools, Our Lady of Mercy and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s. As the Grosvenor students waited for the Catholics to arrive, <PERSON> Leanne </PERSON> said, `` they were literally trying to think what these Catholics were going to look like. Are they going to talk funny and what are their names going to be like? `` Because we'd never met, we just had these ideas about the other side, and then when we came together, we just realized they were just like us.'' Over the past year, the students have exchanged further visits. Friendships have grown outside school, with frequent visits to local discos, restaurants and the movies, and shared stays at a government-sponsored camp. The Grosvenor girls have also participated in a play, `` Bridges of Celebration,'' with boys from <ORGANIZATION> Corpus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> secondary school in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, an Irish <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> stronghold. It filled the Opera House in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> and will be performed again in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> in February. Recalling the first rehearsal, on neutral ground at <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Leanne </PERSON> said: `` When they first walked in ... they just sat down and stared at you I said, ` Oh dear, what's this going to be like?' But then we got to know them and we realized they were great.'' She has no illusions that her activities will change the country. `` No way. I'm never going to become a Catholic and none of them are ever going to become a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> just because they've met,'' she said. `` But just the fact that we are meeting and becoming friends ... it is harder to hate someone if you know them.''

<TEXT>
 West Germans are showing sharp impatience with foreign <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> troops on their soil as their perception grows of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a nation of peace. The top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military commander in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> calls it `` wishful thinking.'' On Nov. 22, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> armored unit scrapped plans to enter a northern town during maneuvers because the townspeople were fed up with the noise and property damage created by war games. Three months earlier, a court blocked <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> plans to station 36 helicopters outside <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>. The ruling came amid intense local opposition to the noise caused by American aircraft and forces already in the area. American troops and other forces of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> have been guarding this frontline nation since the end of World War II. In maneuvers designed to keep the alliance's forces at peak readiness, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> tanks rumble across West German farms and as jet aircraft swoop in on low passes. But West German politicians say they are facing what has become a widespread public perception that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Soviet president, is a messenger of peace, and an accompanying attitude that perhaps the hair-trigger military readiness and the resulting inconveniences can finally be lessened. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced Wednesday before the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that he will reduce Soviet forces by 500,000 troops, including removing 50,000 soldiers and six tank divisions from Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by 1991. West German unease about foreign troops within its borders has increased this year amid a rash of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> jet crashes. On Thursday a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighter jet slammed into <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION>, killing the pilot and five people on the ground. Seventy people were killed in a fiery air show disaster Aug. 28 at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>, when Italian stunt planes collided. `` There is a deep-seated longing for peace. People find the idea of lowering the military posture very attractive,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, a federal lawmaker in Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> says <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is a committed <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> partner and that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government sees the foreign troops in his country as still necessary for the security of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> adds that domestic political pressure for a serious reduction in low-level <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> jet flights, fewer maneuvers that damage property, and other demands can not be ignored. <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Voigt </PERSON>, a lawmaker with the left-leaning opposition Social Democrats, agreed. `` It is increasingly difficult for politicians of all political colors to defend defensive needs against regional and national pressures,'' <PERSON> Voigt </PERSON> said at the Nov. 13-18 <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> congress of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, an independent body of lawmakers from the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations. The Social Democrats have taken a harder stance than the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, maintaining that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s overall defense strategy is outdated and needs to be reworked. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials and conservative <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politicians in recent months have been aggressively trying to counteract West European perceptions of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as a peacemaker. `` We must not get a distorted idea of what is really happening,'' Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, supreme Allied commander in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, recently told reporters. `` Wishful thinking is causing the West to get deeper into a situation in which support for deterrence may be seriously threatened.'' A new West German unease about foreign troops on their soil has become especially apparent during the debate in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> over `` burden-sharing.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials charge that <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is not shouldering its fair share of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s financial burden and are asking <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other countries to spend more for defense. The accusation is a sensitive one in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where about 400,000 foreign <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> troops, including 250,000 Americans, are based. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> himself has suggested that his countrymen already endure enough inconvenience because of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> troops on their soil. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and other West German officials suggest the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not be looking just at dollars and cents when weighing each <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nation's contribution to the alliance. The West Germans say other factors should be assessed as well, such as foreign tanks tearing up farmland and fears among the population caused by low-level flights by military jets. `` There are 5,000 military exercises in this densely populated country each year,'' said <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, the Christian Democrat lawmaker. `` There's no piece of real estate where you have a greater concentration of soldiers and weapons _ including nuclear weapons. `` The Americans should understand these burdens. We want them to stay here, but they must realize this is a political burden.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Enders </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION>, said a recent survey indicated that about 80 percent of West Germans backs <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, but he added that a `` resurgence of neutralism'' within <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could grow with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in power in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. An poll this past summer indicated that 71 percent of West Germans had a favorable opinion of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, compared with only 41 percent for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government assures its transatlantic allies that it is not convinced the threat from the East has vanished, and that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is committed to keeping <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strong. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>: `` We're right next door to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, so we know full well why that is important.''

 A new kind of state prison _ for pregnant inmates only _ opens today in an effort to keep new mothers and their babies together. Although a few other prison systems in the country make efforts to allow mothers to remain for a time with their infants, the <ORGANIZATION> Neil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> section will offer features unavailable elsewhere. Separating women and babies at birth causes `` a serious rupture in mother-infant bonding,'' said <PERSON> Lyla </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, co-director of Social Justice for Women, a private, non-profit advocacy group for women prison inmates. The group will run the $ 550,000 program under a contract with the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a historic step for the state and the country, to show respect for the mother and infant bond,'' Ms. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said last week. Currently, inmates in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> are separated from their children and returned to their cells within days of giving birth. Inmates of the 15-bed facility will be confined to the building but have access to counselors, drug rehabilitation, help in readjusting to society and medical care during pregnancy and after. The first resident, expected to be admitted in January, will find an atmosphere more like a halfway house than a jail. Guards will wear civilian clothes. Only women eligible for early release will be considered for admission, and it is expected that they will complete their sentences at the house. `` Three years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> decided some immediate action was needed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said. `` We had been working with women at -LRB- the state prison at -RRB- <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>. We saw the numbers of pregnant women growing.'' About 50 pregnant women go through the state prison system every year; there were 17 prison births in 1986, the last year for which figures were available. The average sentence for women convicted in this state is four months, usually for drug-related crimes and prostitution, correction officials said. Since 1980 the number of women imprisoned in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has risen 239 percent, an increase Ms. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> attributed to the general trend nationwide toward incarcerating people and away from sexism. Early in this century women routinely kept their babies with them in prison until people began to worry about the stigma attached to anyone who claimed a prison as their birthplace. More recently, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> started allowing babies born in prison to stay with their mothers until their first birthday, said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON>, deputy superintendent for services at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> prison at <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. `` The bonding that results is very positive, both for mother and child, the way the babies develop and mature,'' <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, qualified pregnant inmates receive a 60-day furlough 30 days before they are due to give birth so that delivery can occur outside prison. But most women imprisoned in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, like those in other states, must return to their cells 40 to 72 hours after giving birth. Prison officials around the country said they knew of no such community-based program and said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> program sounded like a good idea. `` I see when the women come in here that one of the hardest things is being separated from their children,'' said <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, associate warden of prisons at the federal minimum-security prison for women in <LOCATION> Alderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>

<HEAD>Bowen: Bush Has Hands Full with Medicare Spending Spiral</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will have its hands full trying to cap Medicare's spending spiral without cutting into the quality of health care the program provides to 32 million Americans, says outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>. `` One the reasons it's going to be tougher is because of the massive new numbers of old people that we have coming along,'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said. With overall Medicare costs growing at about twice the rate of inflation, <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said the $ 100 billion program is a natural place to look for savings. `` At the same time we have to walk a very tight line and make sure we are not reducing the quality of care and access to care,'' he said in an interview. `` It is my judgment that we're getting close to that level now and we have to be very cautious about going too deep.'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> declined to discuss specifics of the final budget the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration will submit next month, but department sources have acknowledged agreeing to about $ 6 billion in net reductions in projected Medicare outlays, mostly by holding down payments to doctors and hospitals. The physician portion of <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> _ Part B _ is growing about 15 percent a year and Democrats and Republicans alike in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have said it will undergo close scrutiny in budget deliberations. Beyond the cuts he has agreed to for the next budget, <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said, `` We are getting close to the time where further ratcheting down could cause some deterioration in the quality of care and perhaps even access to care.'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, who will be 71 in February and plans to retire in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, noted that projections call for the number of people over the age of 100 to increase from 25,000 to 100,000 over the next decade. Not only will they tend to require more medical attention, but many also will used up savings and `` might become a bigger burden'' on public assistance, he said. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, a former two-term governor of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> who said running that state was easier than running the huge <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> department, said his greatest accomplishment was getting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to back a catastrophic-illness insurance addition to <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> in the most sweeping expansion of the program since its birth two decades ago. `` Getting the president's approval over the objections of so many in the Cabinet, that was the tough part,'' said <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>. `` Once the president gave his approval, then it became a lot easier to try to contain the number of additions <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wanted to add to it.'' On the other hand, <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said he is disappointed he has been unable to get states to move more quickly to solve medical malpractice insurance problems which he said are threatening access to health care in some regions. He said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration should be ready to introduce federal legislation to override the states on the issue unless they move quickly. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said he was not suggesting such a step during the coming year, `` but certainly within four years'' unless the states act. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said there is a remaining need for special emphasis on AIDS `` because of the emotional response of the people. People are scared to death.'' `` I hesitate to single it out as a disease to be treated differently from others, but I think as yet it does need to have a little extra special treatment,'' he said. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said he has not been consulted by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition officials for a recommendation on who should succeed him. But he said he hopes the incoming president will not view the appointment as minor. `` When you're talking about a kinder and gentler <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, you're talking about <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said of the huge agency that has a larger budget than the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and embraces such programs as Social Security, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and welfare The department also includes the sprawling <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> umbrella that covers such well-known agencies as the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and the Centers for Disease Control. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said he hopes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will give the new <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> secretary authority to pick the heads of those major agencies. `` I think loyalty is one of the most important attributes of somebody who is working for you and the appointing authority sort of draws that loyalty,'' he said. `` I think you can get a lot more accomplished and better serve the public if you have a team rather than somebody who you never knew and never worked with. Maybe you would n't develop the confidence in them you should.''

<HEAD>Nearly 10 Million Lost Jobs Due to Plant Closings, Layoffs Last
Five Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 10 million Americans lost their jobs due to plant closings or layoffs from 1983 to 1988 despite the longest peacetime economic expansion in the nation's history, the government reports. Of 9.7 million displaced workers during the period, 4.7 million were so-called `` tenured'' workers who had held their jobs for three years or more, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> says in the latest of its biennial reports on worker displacement. That was a slight decline from earlier BLS studies of overlapping five-year periods _ 1979-84 and 1981-86 _ which both had shown that 5.1 million tenured workers lost their jobs during the respective periods. But each of those periods also included the severe recession of 1981-82. As a result, government and private economists say the new figures show a persisting displacement problem. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mishel </PERSON>, an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank, called the decline in job displacement after the recession years `` surprisingly small.'' The <ORGANIZATION> BLS </ORGANIZATION> began conducting the displacement surveys in 1984 at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The latest report was released over the weekend. While the 1984 and 1986 surveys showed 50 percent of the displaced workers coming out of factories, only 40 percent of the tenured workers losing their jobs in 1983-88 had been employed in manufacturing. In conjunction, the distribution of the layoffs has shifted somewhat from blue-collar occupations such as machine operators, laborers and repairmen during the recession periods to white-collar management and sales occupations from 1983 to 1988. `` This was the lean-and-mean era, when companies went after middle-level managers and other white-collar workers,'' said <PERSON> Mishel </PERSON>. `` But a lot of it, especially in retail trade, is also somewhat related to these leveraged buyouts. It's probably the better-paid retail workers who lost their jobs.'' One thing that has n't changed is the percentage of workers who were given some kind of advance notice before losing their jobs. In all three surveys, roughly six of every 10 displaced workers had been told in advance to `` expect a layoff.'' But only two of every 10 in the latest survey said they had received a written notice of their impending dismissals _ a trend bound to change in view of a new law requiring 60 days written notice of plant closings and large layoffs beginning in 1989. Of the 4.7 million tenured workers who lost their jobs from 1983 to the end of 1987, 71 percent or approximately 3.2 million of them had new jobs as of January last year and 14 percent of them said they were looking for work. That compares favorably with re-employment rates of 67 percent and 60 percent and unemployment rates of 18 percent and 25 percent in the respective 1986 and 1984 surveys. Of those re-employed full-time, 56 percent reported making as much or more money in their new jobs while 44 percent reported making less _ in current dollars unadjusted for inflation. About 28 percent reported that their earnings had increased by 20 percent or more in their new jobs. Taking inflation into account, analysts said, that represents the workers who definitely are better off in their new jobs than they were in their old ones. But a slightly larger group, 30 percent, reported suffering an income loss of at least 20 percent from their old jobs. `` That's much deeper than in the previous surveys,'' said <PERSON> Mishel </PERSON>. `` It confirms a continuing trend of high-paid workers having no alternative but to shift to the poorer-paying jobs being created by this recovery.''

 Setting up the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration _ the task of some 300 people who toil in offices above a drugstore _ is being underwritten by the taxpayers to the tune of about $ 3.5 million. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s paid transition staff has grown to 149 at last count, with about the same number of volunteers, officials say. The highest paid are top advisers <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeder </PERSON>, both of whom are being paid at an annual rate of $ 71,377. After the transition, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will become secretary of state. To meet the payroll as well as pay for copying, research, telephones, rent, supplies and the like, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> receives a total of $ 3.5 million in public money. The money is allocated under the Presidential Transition Act of 1964. The amount was increased this year from the $ 2 million that was allowed when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office eight years ago. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> operation, housed in three floors of an office building across the street from the hotel where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was shot and wounded in 1981, is far more spare than the mini-bureaucracy of more than 1,000 people who worked for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s transition in 1980. And unlike <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not supplementing his transition allowance with private donations. `` We just wanted to work within the money appropriated by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and not make this become a big, fat, bloated operation,'' said transition spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>. `` This is not going to be a fast-growing bureaucracy. At this point close to $ 800,000 has not been allocated by us to our budget, which does indicate that we could return a sizeable chunk of money to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>.'' Volunteers are being used in clerical positions and the work days for transition officials stretch into late-night hours that have provoked some grumbling about the need for more staff. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, comptroller of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for overseeing transition spending, called it a `` very lean'' operation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition staff can be smaller because, as a member of the same party and administration already in power, he will not be making the sweeping changes that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made when he took over from <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` This is what we call a friendly takeover,'' said <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>. The amount <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> finally spent on his transition was never known, because he was not required to disclose the amount of private contributions his team collected, said <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> public affairs specialist <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiheen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ended up not actually spending all the public money, and returned some $ 250,000 of the $ 2 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> records. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year enacted a disclosure requirement for any private money raised by the transition operations. <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> said that just over a third of the transition budget is going into payroll. Salary schedules for the transition workers are set according to <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> scales, with the average salary at $ 35,137, according to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition officials. A status report to the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION>, detailing expenditures through the end of November, showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had run up bills of more than $ 1 million in payroll and benefits for employees, many of whom went onto the transition payroll straight from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. Rent and utilities came to almost $ 100,000, while printing and reproduction had cost $ 27,000. The transition had bills of $ 11,000 for supplies and had spent almost $ 149,000 on `` other services.''

<HEAD>After First Dance, School Board Still Wants Ban</HEAD>

 The first dance in this 100-year-old Ozark town's high school is just a memory, but the students who thought it was `` a blast'' may not get an encore. The school board is appealing a court ruling that its policy against school dances is unconstitional. A federal appeals court allowed Saturday night's dance while the matter is considered. Officials restricted the dance to <ORGANIZATION> Purdy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s 161 students, saying they wanted to avoid any chance of trouble. Among those barred were reporters and photographers, and even an alumnus who was the lead plaintiff in the federal lawsuit that brought dancing to <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> <PERSON> High </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>, a 1987 graduate, got only as close as the basketball game that preceded the homecoming dance. `` It's OK, though _ I won,'' <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> said as he watched the game and greeted old friends. `` It's still worth it. The idea was to allow <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> students to have a dance, and we did that.'' <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>, a business school student, and 20 other <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> students and parents sued in 1986 to overturn the school board's written policy banning dancing. Longtime residents in this town of 900 say <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> has never been without a ban on social dancing in the schools. Some have said they associate dancing with drinking, drugs and illicit sex. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> ruled this summer that the school board's ban promoted the values of those who oppose dancing for religious reasons. The board appealed <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s order that they stop enforcing the ban, but the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> is not expected to rule in the case before next year. The dance ban evoked comparisons to the hit movie `` Footloose'' about a similar ban in a fictional town. Although barred from dancing at school, <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> students have held dances at the community center or in neighboring towns. But they said that was inconvenient and unfair. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Buxton </PERSON>, superintendent of the <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> school system, said about 85 students attended Saturday night's dance. He said it went smoothly, but he refused to comment on whether other dances could be expected. Student council president <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said board members attended the dance. But the board members, who sat on the sidelines during the dance talking among themselves, apparently did not cramp students' style. `` It was a blast, we had a great time,'' Miss <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. `` It was really fun, everybody's dancing,'' said <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON>, a senior who left the dance early. But Miss Francisco, 17, added that the dance had caused controversy and bitterness in the southwestern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> town. `` I do n't think it was worth all that,'' she said. Miss <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, appearing tired but happy after a day that included a college entrance exam and the history-making dance, said early Sunday that she was n't ready to plan another dance. `` I'm still thinking about cleanup for this one,'' she said.

<HEAD>Eggnog Sales Bring Cheer to Dairy Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The traditional eggnog season is in full swing and every cup that's raised should bring cheer to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s dairy farmers, says an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist. Most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dairy production is consumed as Grade A milk, cheese, butter and non-fat dry milk. But dairy economist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says several frequently overlooked products `` lie in the shadows'' of the big-volume items. These include eggnog, fluid cream, yogurt, cottage cheese and canned milk, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Collectively, they use the equivalent of about 11 billion pounds of milk each year and have a farm value of about $ 1 billion. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, in a report and a telephone interview, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial use of milk in 1987 was a record of about 136 billion pounds and that this year's consumption probably will edge still higher. Although <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he had no breakdown showing how much eggnog counted in the group of lesser items, sales figures indicate that eggnog has grown in popularity, more than doubling between 1970 and 1987. `` Some growth in eggnog sales has come from use outside the holiday season,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. At one time, milk processors started selling eggnog just before Thanksgiving and quit in late December. Today, he said, some eggnog processors begin selling for Halloween and continue through the holidays. Sales are sometimes resumed for a brief Easter season. But it will take more than merriment around the holiday eggnog bowl to keep pace with American dairy farmers. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s recent outlook conference that milk production this year is expected to rise 2 percent to another record level of around 145 billion pounds. Production declined slightly in 1987 to 142.5 billion pounds from the record in 1986 of 143.5 billion pounds. `` The new record was reached because of an increase of almost 3 percent in milk per cow,'' he said. The number of cows in production this year was estimated at 10.2 million, down 1 percent from 1987 and the fewest on record. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said there are a lot of variables ahead for 1989, including feed costs and other factors. Even so, total milk output next year `` may be about the same'' as in 1988, while commercial use may be up 1 percent to 3 percent. Another factor in the dairy business has been the increase in use of fluid cream, with sales rising by three-fourths between 1970 and 1987, he said. Whipping cream more than doubled, while half-and-half and light cream showed similar gains. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> added that `` yogurt has received a great deal of attention'' because of its popularity among weight watchers and other consumers. Last year, he said, yogurt sales were up sixfold from 1970, but he added that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> yogurt market was tiny before the introduction of sweetened, fruit-flavored brands. `` Lost in the excitement about yogurt's rapid growth is the realization that yogurt remains a minor use of milk,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` Growth in yogurt sales since 1970 has contributed considerably less to farm milk demand than have increases in fluid cream use.''

 Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is likely to push for more conservative arms-control stances during backstage negotiations, but he no doubt will toe the administration line in public, national security analysts say. `` <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s certainly been more conservative than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but this is going to be a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, not a <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> administration,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON>, a national security analyst with the non-profit, conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON>, director of the liberal Council for a Livable World, agreed. `` I think that to the extent there's any disagreement between the two, it will be <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> making the accommodation, not <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a Republican from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, was one of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s most conservative members on national security issues during his eight years in the chamber. For example, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> voiced a series of questions and criticisms earlier this year about the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty negotiated by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strongly supported the pact, which was ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who eventually voted for the pact, said in a 1987 interview that `` I have a lot of questions -LRB- about the INF treaty -RRB-, and I do n't believe in the long run, quite frankly, contrary to the popular perception, that this is going to be a big political plus for this administration.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also has voiced skepticism about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration efforts to negotiate a U.S.-Soviet Strategic Arms Reduction Talk treaty providing deep reductions in the long-range arsenals of each nation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has supported those efforts and pledged to work toward a START pact after he replaces <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Jan. 20. In a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing last Feb. 3 on the INF pact, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` If in fact we do not get a START agreement, it is not going to be the end of the world. As a matter of fact, it might give us some time to see how the INF agreement is going to be implemented.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his first debate with Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said, `` We've achieved an arms control agreement -LRB- INF -RRB- that our critics thought was never possible. And I want to build on it _ I want to see us finalize the START agreement.'' Both <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be negotiating to reduce conventional weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where the Soviets have a large numerical advantage. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbrunner </PERSON>, director of foreign policy studies for the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s influence is likely to be limited when the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration begins drafting arms control positions. `` <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been a classic hardliner on arms control, but I do n't think many people imagine that he's going to have a very great weight in deliberations,'' <PERSON> Steinbrunner </PERSON> said. `` The speculation really focuses on how <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own plans evolve.'' `` Quayle and other members of the right wing would have slowed up or strung out the INF treaty if they had the votes, but they showed they did n't have the votes,'' <PERSON> Steinbrunner </PERSON> said. `` The right wing has limited appeal. It's very vociferous, it's very intense, but in fact it's not in line with most people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON>, who helped negotiate the SALT I and Anti-Ballistic Missile treaties, agreed that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is likely to have only limited influence. `` Quayle wo n't differ publicly, but he may be a voice for the conservatives within the inner councils of the administration. I do n't expect that he'll have a large influence, but his opinion may be sought by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to understand what the conservatives are thinking,'' <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON> concurred that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is likely to seek to influence administration positions. `` Certainly <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will support the administration in public, despite what it does, but I presume he will have some influence in the in-house meetings that lead up to the public positions,'' he said.

<HEAD>Base-Closing Panel Will Meet Year-End Deadline, Chairman Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A presidential commission studying the nation's more than 3,800 military installations is closing in on its goal of determining which ones should be shut down Former Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Republican who is co-chairman of the 12-member panel, says it will meet its year-end deadline of recommending which bases should be closed. But <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said a final list has yet to be prepared by the commission, which will report to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. `` People keep asking about a list and wanting to know how many bases, but we do n't have a goal in terms of numbers,'' he said. `` We have n't made any final decisions yet.'' The commission is an attempt to untie a congressional knot that has blocked the Pentagon from closing any bases since 1977. Legislators, loathe to lose the jobs that bases provide, have erected a long and complicated series of barriers to individual closings. `` Closing bases is tough for any congressman,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` You're talking lost jobs and that means unhappy voters. This is near and dear to all our hearts.'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said he does n't know how many bases will be on the final list, but <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> predicted `` the figure will likely be 20 to 25 bases, perhaps a few more.'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, who said he has purposefully remained aloof from the panel's work, estimated that annual savings will be about $ 2 billion. Besides evaluating data from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, the commission is also listening to petitions from congressmen and their constituents. Last week, Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., delivered more than 13,000 letters from Enid, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, urging the panel not to close <ORGANIZATION> Vance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> Earlier, legislators from northeastern states ranging from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> had written the panel, urging that <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> states suffer the most reductions because they said those states had the most bases. After the <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' panel finishes its work, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> will have until Jan. 15 _ five days before he leaves office _ to accept or reject the entire list. He ca n't make any other changes. If <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> approves the list as expected, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could only block the closures if the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> each pass a disapproval resolution. That resolution could be vetoed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meaning it would effectively take a two-thirds vote in each chamber to block the shutdowns. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> explained that his panel is using a complicated set of criteria to make its decisions. First, installations are being grouped by military mission; for example, all Army depots, all <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> fighter bases, all <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ports for surface ships. Then bases in a particular category will be evaluated for five factors _ mission suitability, including geographical location and ease of deployment; physical facilities in place; the quality of those facilities; quality of life for personnel, such as housing; and community support. Bases at the bottom of each `` mission'' list will be considered for closure, partly by determining if other, higher-ranking bases can become `` receiving'' facilities. Next, cost evaluations will be done, environmental factors such as hazardous waste problems will be considered, and the impact of the lost jobs will be weighed. `` It's an extremely complicated process,'' said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. `` We have a huge amount of information to evaluate and judgments to make.'' The Pentagon and the services have n't offered any lists. `` What we have done is asked the services for information, a tremendous amount of information,'' he said. `` We're checking that information by sending staff members and commission members out to the bases in some instances, talking to base commanders and local people.'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> insists politics is n't an issue. `` This the most non-partisan committee I've ever been associated with. Believe me, that's the truth.'' `` We do n't look at our charge as having anything to do with politics. We have n't looked at whose district a base is located in,'' he said. `` Obviously, everybody else in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> approaches it from the perspective of politics, but we have n't.''

<HEAD>Teachers Frustrated By Lack of Support from Parents, Social
Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than half of the nation's teachers say they see evidence of child abuse, poor nutrition and parental neglect in their classrooms, according to a national study. `` Teachers repeatedly made the point that in the push for better schools they can not do the job alone, and yet there is a growing trend to expect schools to do what families, communities and churches have been unable to accomplish,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Teaching. The foundation's survey of 22,000 teachers found a sense of frustration among teachers, both at `` the lack of support they receive from parents'' and from a feeling of `` powerlessness in teaching,'' he said. `` Large majorities of teachers find poverty, poor health, undernourishment and neglect to be problems at their schools,'' he said. Teachers from every state were canvassed in twin surveys conducted by mail in the spring and fall of 1987. The findings were released Sunday. Among them: _ 90 percent said lack of parental support was a problem at their schools _ 89 percent said there were abused or neglected children at their schools _ 69 percent said poor health was a problem for their students _ 68 percent said some children were undernourished Teachers in the survey described their students `` as ` emotionally needy' and ` starved for attention and affection,''' <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the report underscores the need for parental involvement. `` I wish I could sit down with every parent in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and emphasize how important they are to their children's education,'' Ms. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said. `` Parents are a child's first _ and potentially the most influential _ teachers.'' The average public school teacher earned $ 28,031 in 1987-88, according to figures from the NEA. Forty-nine percent of the teachers in the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> survey said their pay was worse than they expected; 41 percent said it was about what they expected, and 10 percent said it was better. The average teacher surveyed had 16 years experience. The average teacher faced 79 students on a typical day, with elementary teachers working with 60 different pupils and secondary teachers 114. The typical class size was 23. Sixty-two percent of the teachers said their most typical class was about the right size; 36 percent felt it was too large, and 1 percent said it was too small -LRB- The figures do not add up to 100 percent because of rounding -RRB-. Only 7 percent of the teachers surveyed said they planned to quit the profession as soon as they could. Fifty-six percent planned to teach until they retire; 21 percent said they probably would continue teaching; 10 percent were undecided about their career plans, and 6 percent said they may take time off from teaching. The <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, published earlier `` Condition of Teaching'' reports in 1983 and 1985. It said the overall margin of error on the unusually large survey was only plus or minus 1 percentage point.

I saw people carrying wounded Tibetans on their backs, running into their houses and trying to find some place to hide,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, a sociology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newfoundland </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. He said he dashed up a street to dodge police bullets and tear gas. `` It seemed like an eternity I was running up that street,'' he said in a telephone interview Sunday with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The clash broke out Saturday in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> when 30 Tibetans, identified by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> as <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and nuns, marched into a market with the banned <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> flag to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the U.N. Declaration on Human Rights. The protesters, dressed in street clothes and face masks, demanded an end to 38 years of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> communist rule over the Himalayan Mountain region. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said Sunday that a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk was killed and 13 people were wounded when police fired at demonstrators. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said the monk had been carrying <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s banned flag. Police `` appeared, marching in a tight formation. They fanned out in an arc, some very close to the monks,'' said <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>. He and the other foreign witnesses said the police then opened fire without warning. The nationally televised evening news said police `` were forced to fire'' when `` some troublemakers refused to heed a warning and threw stones and bottles at police.'' `` The soldiers were running after us. They came so close,'' said <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, who was shot in the left arm. `` They started shooting, and we started running. I ran for my life,'' said another witness, an English woman who spoke on condition of anonymity. One traveler, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a Tibetan who went to a hospital to give blood for the wounded saw four bodies. The foreigners, who spoke by telephone from their hotels, said authorities imposed tight security in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> and searched foreigners' hotel rooms on Sunday Ms. <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON> said after she was wounded, she tried to hide `` but they came after me so I ran again.'' `` There was no looking back, it was just running, running. I heard the bullets skimming past my head: shoo, shoo. My only thought was, ` I have to hide.' I ran into a Tibetan courtyard. There were many people there in panic. I said, ` I'm wounded,' and I fainted.'' A British man who spoke on condition of anonymity said he ran in a different direction and found himself in a narrow alley with about 50 Tibetans. `` The police fired tear gas at both ends of the alley,'' he said. `` I thought I was going to die of suffocation.'' After 10 minutes, he said the gas subsided, and the group escaped. `` Some Tibetans took me to a small temple where I saw the dead body of the monk who had been shot in the head,'' he said. `` There was a crowd of Tibetans weeping.'' At the scene of the shooting, he said, a tear-gas canister lay near a pool of blood. `` Within half an hour after the demonstration, Tibetans began laying white scarves near the pool of blood and the canister,'' he said. Tibetan Buddhists drape gauzy, white scarves over the statues of deities in their temples as a gesture of greeting and respect. Saturday's was the third bloody confrontation in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> between authorities and anti-Chinese protesters since October 1987. At least 38 people were killed in the earlier clashes, and hundreds were arrested. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government, which claims <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> has been part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the 13th century, moved troops into the remote region in 1950. <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> was then ruled by a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> theocracy headed by the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, who fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> when the Chinese put down a 1959 uprising.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was four or five years old when he dropped to his hands and knees, crawled unseen beneath the toll collector's window and then sprinted to the far end of the pedestrian bridge. `` One of the rituals of growing up here was to skip across without paying the toll,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 55, pointing to the narrow span where workers once paid two cents to cross the river to jobs in the mill. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was home in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> last week after being elected by his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues to become majority leader of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He will lead rituals of lawmaking far more embroidered than the childhood challenge of the bridge. But back home, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> showed himself as a homespun fellow who does n't forget the lessons of his life. And in a series of meetings around the state, he demonstrated a political repertoire he's destined to employ in the thicket inside the Capitol _ DISAGREE BUT DO N'T ARGUE `` The fact is that issues come and go, and on any public policy there are valid arguments on both sides,'' he tells an audience in the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> gymnasium. _ KEEP BRAGGING IN ITS PLACE, a place like your home state This is a constant in <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s banter, even when it approaches the ridiculous. `` Those are the best bagels in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> right there,'' he said, passing a bakery in <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>. He went on to explain to a skeptical reporter that `` the reason is they're not really bagels, they're much lighter.'' Down the street was `` the best salad bar in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The town also had the best 4th of July parade, and for this <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> offered a plausible explanation. `` It's the best parade to march in because it's all downhill,'' he said. _ REMEMBER THE SHORTCUTS `` Turn left after <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> shoes,'' he ordered an aide, as they rushed to make an appointment in <LOCATION> Ellsworth </LOCATION>. The back road reduced the trip, and if <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> can find shortcuts through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s legislative logjam his colleagues will make him a hero. _ DO N'T GET TOO COCKY `` He does n't really have the opportunity to savor the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader -LRB- election -RRB- too long,'' explains brother <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who was joyously trading insults with his younger brother across their sister's kitchen table. `` You know what <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> would say about the deficit? ` Let's spend it,''' the senator says. _ TAKE SOME BLAME, especially when it's yours for the taking When a citizen at a town meeting refers to the federal deficit as `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Republican,'' the eight-year senator concedes that `` in fairness, I think we're part of the problem too.'' _ ENJOY YOUR JOB <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Presque </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> receives three packages of imported vegetables from potato farmers who are considering using Japanese or European vacuum-processing methods of preservation. `` I get paid for this,'' exults <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, fascinated by the products and the possibilities of using the new system to make more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food available to developing countries that lack refrigeration. His task: to find ways to counter Canadian subsidies which might put the plant across the border. _ TAKE IT, TO A POINT A constituent in <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON>, the only precinct in the state <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> lost in November when he won his second full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> term, blasts him for opposing efforts to outlaw all abortions. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> had enough, however, when the man likened him to `` pimps, prostitutes and witches.'' The constituent, he said, was trying to practice guilt by association and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> backed him down, winning kudos from the crowd even though most disagree with him on the issue. _ TAKE IT WITH HUMOR A <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION> constituent suggested a solution to the nation's foreign debt of biblical proportions: have all nations wipe the slate clean and start over again. `` Well, it has the advantage of being a dramatic proposal,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, drawing a chuckle from the others at the town meeting but not at the expense of the woman making the proposal. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> will have 99 constituents, 54 other Democrats and 45 Republicans. And they mostly have bigger egos and less self-sufficiency than the good people of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. He'll need all the skills he uses at his town meetings, and possibly a few he does n't show his constituents. Such as sneaking past the toll booth, if that's what's needed to get to the other side.

 The state has $ 3 million in checks it ca n't seem to give away.

 Peace is as rare today as the <ORGANIZATION> Ceylon </ORGANIZATION> of antiquity, when <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Polo </PERSON> marveled at the fist-sized gems and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> traders called the island `` Serendib,'' a place of pleasant surprises. The surprises now are routinely nasty. The <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> nation, once likened to paradise by the poets, has become the battleground of a sectarian conflict between two of the world's most tolerant religions, <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Buddhism. Tamil rebels, seeking independence for their ethnic minority, butcher civilians of the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese majority and turn their guns and swords on the previously unthreatened Moslem community. Sinhalese militants, infuriated at the government's efforts to make peace with the Tamils, wage a campaign of terror and intimidation that some observers fear could force cancellation of Dec. 19 presidential elections. Hit squads, in turn, hunt and kill the Sinhalese radicals they blame for the escalating violence. `` A dark veil of anarchy and bloodshed has descended on our country,'' said <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, former prime minister and the presidential candidate of the main opposition Sri <ORGANIZATION> Lanka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Opposition parties, the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> clergy and human rights and labor organizations have repeatedly urged a caretaker government, saying it would help defuse the crisis on an island once considered a model of economic progress and stability in the Third World. With less than two weeks left in office, President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> has resisted the calls, saying he will dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and then step aside once his successor is chosen. The Buddhist Sinhalese and the Hindu Tamils, both descendents of migrants from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, have been battling each other for more than 2,500 years. The contemporary problem ignited in 1983, when the Tamils exploded their campaign for a separate homeland in the north and east into a guerrilla war, contending the Sinhalese rejected their language, denied them jobs and gave them too little money for education and development. Nearly 10,000 people have died in the fighting, more than 500,000 have been routed from their homes, and the economy, once buoyed by a booming tourist industry, is in ruins. In July 1987, with the help of neighboring <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the regional power in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and home of 60 million Tamils, the government signed a peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil insurgency in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The pact guaranteed some automony to the Tamils and for the first time publicly stated that the Sinhalese-dominated government was willing to share power. It also invited <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to send troops to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to end the war and supervise the accord. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> took political risks when he accepted the accord, angering opposition politicians, religious leaders and even some members of his Cabinet. The most militant Tamils rejected the accord, saying it did n't meet enough of their demands for self-rule The Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the island's 16 million people, said the government had sold out to the Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of the population. Indian troops soon were fighting the very people they were sent to protect. More than 625 soldiers have died in the fighting. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a shadowy group forced underground after a 1971 attempted coup, emerged and vowed to kill anyone who supports the accord. The front, better known for its violent acts than its Marxist ideology, within 16 months had been blamed for more than 900 political murders and nearly succeeding in assassinating <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> in a daring grenade attack in Parliament. Only one of the three presidential candidates, <PERSON> Ossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Abeygoonsekera </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, has dared to openly criticize the front, and he nearly paid with his life. Twice in less than a month, Sinhalese militants hurled bombs into his campaign rallies, killing eight people and injuring more than 150. Neither Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> nor Prime Minister <PERSON> Ramasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, the candidate of the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has indicated how they propose to tackle the front if elected. In an apparent bid to buy peace, both have steered clear of criticizing the front. The front, however, has turned its guns on them. Both have canceled campaign rallies because of threats. When the front demanded all <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officeholders in the south, the Sinhalese heartland, either quit or be killed, a number obeyed and prominently displayed their resignation letters. `` The task of creating a new era to solve the country's problems, of providing a new leadership, of building a new nation is in our hands,'' <PERSON> Rohana </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON>, leader of the front, said in a rare interview recently with The <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. `` The members of our party are willing to sacrifice their lives for their country and people. When our members are willing to lead the people at the risk of torture and death, the people will have to make at least a small sacrifice to liberate the country,'' said <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON>, who has been compared privately by senior government officials to <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> widely held responsible for the deaths of 1 million Cambodians from 1975-79. Last month, in its most daring effort yet to destabilize the government, the front told government and other employees to stay away from work or be killed. Shops, banks and post offices closed their doors, and trains sat idle in the railyards. Troops drove public buses, manned ports and operated gasoline stations. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> responded by arming the military with unprecedented powers, including the right to shoot anyone participating in anti-government demonstrations, and decreeing death by hanging for anyone instigating protests or writing, printing, distributing or displaying threatening posters. To counter threats to workers, authorities declared employees who failed to report for work at essential services would be dismissed. Most refused despite the warning, apparently believing it was safer to disobey the government than risk the militants' wrath. The threats, however, have spawned squads that authorities say killed at least 25 suspected Sinhalese militants this month. Most have gathered beneath the mantle of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, believed to be comprised of paramilitary forces and members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a union of four leftist parties. Posters showing grisly photographs of the front's victims and commanding `` Kill Wijeweera'' have been plastered throughout the capital. `` Right now, it seems the government only controls a few army and police posts and <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>,'' said one military official, who can not be identified under briefing rules. `` And on some days, not even <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>US Banker Has New Scheme to Cut Third World Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A leading international banker has a new plan to reduce the burden of debt owed by the Third World without cost to taxpayers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other creditor countries. `` The objective of lower debt service is sound and necessary for some -LRB- debtor countries -RRB-, at least for a time,'' says <PERSON> Pedro-Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuczynski </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` But the idea of using taxpayers' dollars to achieve what the market is already doing, albeit partially, is not.'' Third World debt is expected to reach $ 1.2 trillion by the end of this year, and debt service has become an increasing drain on nations that can least afford it. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> estimates that in 1987 Third World transfers to richer countries were $ 29 billion. Traditionally the flow had been in the other direction, in the same way that money flowed from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to this country when it was developing in the 19th century. In an article for the current issue of the magazine `` International Economy,'' <PERSON> Kuczynski </PERSON> proposes dividing the debts of countries such as <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> into two parts. Interest payments and delayed payments of principal on the first part would continue, but with the size of the debt discounted _ possibly by 40 cents on the dollar. How much of the debt that portion should contain would be established in a deal between the commercial banks and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by 151 governments. They include both debtor and creditor countries. On the second part, <PERSON> Kuczynski </PERSON> would require payments by a debtor country only under two conditions: if it earned more from world trade than an agreed amount, and if its reserves of gold and hard currency were greater than the projected payments. If those conditions were fulfilled in any given year, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> would call on the debtor to pay at least part of the interest and principal owed. Total payments could be as little as 10 percent and as much as 125 percent of the debt. This plan would go on for 10 years. At the end of that time, the debt in the second portion of the plan would be considered paid off. Payments on the first portion would continue. <PERSON> Kuczynski </PERSON> estimated in a telephone interview that his plan could save heavily indebted Latin American countries as much as $ 13 billion a year in the first few years. Later the savings would be less, but the countries would be in a better position to pay. A <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said officials are now reading <PERSON> Kuczynski </PERSON>'s proposal and would have no immediate comment <PERSON> Kuczynski </PERSON> said a way should be found for the billions of dollars in reserves already put aside by creditor banks like his own to be used for a temporary reduction in payments by debtors. He suggested that this is already being done, to some extent. `` In order to get their interest back from the larger debtors, -LRB- the commercial banks -RRB- are themselves putting up about 30 percent of it in refinancing,'' he wrote. `` Lenders might be willing to give up some principal now if they have a chance of recouping it later with gains.'' Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed last week that many debts be forgiven, payments on others by the poorest countries be delayed for as long as a century, and a new international body set up to buy remaining debt at a discount. The last proposal is similar to one in the Trade Act that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed last August, but neither <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> nor the new law suggested who should bear the cost. `` The Soviets themselves could not expect to take advantage of anything like my plan,'' <PERSON> Kuczynski </PERSON> said. `` They owe a pile of money themselves but they have to be very scrupulous about keeping up with all their payments.''

<HEAD>Social Security, Taxes Eyed By Deficit Commission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Republican co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> says the government should consider taking back some of the Social Security benefits paid to higher-income individuals. <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> expressed optimism Sunday that the 12-member panel eventually will produce a consensus report on cutting the federal deficit, with the emphasis on reduced federal spending. `` The position all of us have taken is that we're going to address this based on cutting the spending,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a former transportation secretary in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' program However, he added, `` this does not mean if we are not able to address the issue on that basis, that there are not a number of members on the commission who would prefer a tax increase.'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> specifically mentioned, as `` a last resort,'' some sort of consumption tax that would be adjusted according to each individual's ability to pay. He also offered the term `` rebates'' to describe other revenue sources which do not involve raising taxes. Among these rebates, he said, would be taking back some of the Social Security benefits paid to people with other incomes over $ 90,000 a year, and collecting repayment of some Medicare benefits from the estates of wealthy elderly recipients who die. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said he did not think much of the savings could be achieved in military spending. `` Over half the budget is now in entitlements and interest. Unfortunately, that's where we're going to have to go if we're going to find reductions in spending,'' he said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' Democratic counterpart on the panel. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, appeared on the same program and said he believes that simply cutting spending wo n't be enough. `` I must tell you that in my judgment I have not found sufficient spending cuts to make up the shortfall'' in meeting a deficit-reducing target, said <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>. Such a finding by the panel would be directly at odds with President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Democrats are turning up the heat for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to show how he would close the $ 35 billion gap in meeting next year's deficit-reduction goal. `` I have n't seen a way to get there without some increased revenue. Hopefully we'll find it. If we do n't, I'm going to be for some increased revenue,'' said <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a former Democratic national chairman. Tax increases, while viewed as political poison, have been identified by many economists as the only realistic way to slash deficits and calm nervous financial markets. Though <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> has expressed similar opinions in the past, he was unusually blunt in Sunday's public appraisal. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said he would consider so-called `` sin taxes'' on alcohol and tobacco, or a gasoline or other broad-based energy tax, as likely sources for the needed revenue. Such ideas have received broad support from many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> also agreed that Social Security payments to high-income Americans _ such as himself _ should be taxed. Upper-income recipients of Social Security now pay taxes on half their benefits under a provision that was part of a 1983 change in the law. Some commission witnesses have suggested boosting that level to 85 percent.

 Spanish pop singer <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON> says he suffers from depression caused by hordes of adoring women, a magazine reported today.

 Black students especially in the South are far more likely than whites to be targets of corporal punishment or school suspension, according to a study. `` Teachers often overreact to blacks, especially black males. Interestingly, that's true even with black teachers,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> <PERSON> First </PERSON>, executive director of the Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION>, which Sunday released an analysis of federal school data. The report found black youngsters are more than twice as likely to be hit or be labeled mentally retarded as whites. And while blacks make up 16 percent of the school population, they comprise only 8 percent of those in gifted student programs. The findings were based on an analysis of biennial data published by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, the latest year available. The coalition study projected the rates at which students of different races suffered various school penalties. The coalition found that the 10 states with the biggest black-white disparities in the rate of corporal punishment were nearly all southern: <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Nationwide, male students account for 80 percent of corporal punishment incidents and 70 percent of suspensions, the study found. It shed little light, however, on why blacks seem to bear the brunt of school penalties. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, called the analysis `` disheartening'' and said the study indicated that teachers and administrators sometimes respond in a racist manner to certain students. `` We have our own built-in prejudices about the way certain kids can learn, or how they talk, or how they walk or dress,'' she said. `` I do n't see a lot of efforts to counter that.'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdan </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said her union rejected racism as the explanation. `` It's clear that there are problems. Schools are n't reaching the majority of the students we need to reach. Teachers need the flexibility to meet the needs of individual students,'' she said. First said the results do n't mean blacks and other minority students are breaking school rules more often than whites. Instead, she said, `` teachers tend to react out of their frustration and irritation.'' She said few school districts have systematic controls over discipline, such as requiring teachers to document in writing why a student was referred for discipline. It means students are often punished for trivial offenses, she said. Among the report's findings: _ Nationwide, 5.22 percent of black students received corporal punishment, compared with only 2.28 percent of whites and 2.05 percent of Hispanics. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> had the biggest statewide disparity in corporal punishment rates: 22.57 percent of blacks received such punishment, compared with 10.99 percent of whites, and 5.64 percent of Hispanics. Among the nation's 100 largest school districts, the largest black-white disparities were in <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Nashville-Davidson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. _ Nationwide, 9.07 percent of blacks, 4.44 percent of Hispanics, and 4.05 percent of whites were suspended from school. The racial imbalance in suspension rates was largest in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>: blacks were suspended at a projected 16 percent rate, Hispanics at 9.54 percent, whites at 4.8 percent. Among the largest districts, the biggest racial disparities in suspension rates were in the Alpine School District, in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fork </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Md.; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. _ Blacks nationwide were placed in special classes for the `` educable mentally retarded'' at a 2.3 percent rate, while 0.87 percent of whites and 0.56 percent of Hispanics were similarly labeled. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> exhibited the greatest differences: blacks were labeled `` educable mentally retarded'' at a 6.13 percent rate, compared with 1.99 percent of whites, and 0.79 percent of Hispanics. Among the largest school districts, the largest black-white disparities existed in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Escambia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County-Winston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>; Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb. _ 5.35 percent of white pupils get placed in gifted programs nationwide, compared with 2.44 percent among blacks and 2.41 percent among Hispanics. The differences were largest in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, where whites were placed in such programs at a 9.46 percent rate, compared with 5.62 percent of Hispanics and 2.03 percent of blacks.

<HEAD>Educators Say Prolonged Closure Of Schools Has Left Students
Unmotivated</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> educators say they face a difficult task trying to motivate children deprived of classroom learning during <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s long closure of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools. They say they fear the system may never fully recover. After a nearly 10-month shutdown, elementary schools are again abuzz with children's chatter. Junior high schools reopened Sunday and high schools are to resume next week, bringing all 300,000 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> students back to classes. But, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> educators warn, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s 1,194 schools may never achieve the same standard they maintained before being closed last Feb. 3, remaining shot for all but a few weeks since. `` In the limited period we have to catch up for nearly a year of lost education, I'm sure our standards will decline,'' said <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahshi </PERSON>, principal of the Quaker-run <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. `` The quality of education we could provide before the closure has definitely been lost.'' Army officials say schools were closed because they had turned into breeding grounds for protests during the year-old revolt against 21 years of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Authorities have indefinitely closed <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> universities and colleges and Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Shaike </PERSON> <PERSON> Erez </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> military administration, has warned that other schools will stay open only if they are `` used for learning and not for demonstrations.'' According to Palestinian educators, the closures have brought myriad difficulties, ranging from a decline in enrollment to unmotivated students who have lost the discipline of regular study. `` Our No. 1 problem is getting the children into the habit of coming to school regularly again,'' said <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Rishmawi </PERSON>, principal of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` For almost a full year, these children have been in the habit of watching TV until late at night and getting up at 9 or 10 in the morning. Now we are asking them to get back into the swing of school discipline. It is not going to be easy.'' The task of catching up is further complicated by closure orders from the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. School officials will comply, closing at noon instead of the usual 1 p.m. for public schools and 3 p.m. for private schools. Even though last year's academic term was unfinished, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> students were automatically promoted _ often, educators fear, at the expense of basic skills. `` They have moved on to the next grade, but this really means nothing,'' <PERSON> Mahshi </PERSON> said. `` In terms of learning, these students have lost a year.'' Especially at risk, he said, are children in the primary grades. `` There are critical periods in a child's life when he begins to learn skills like reading, writing and numbers,'' <PERSON> Mahshi </PERSON> said. `` If you miss that period, although he may eventually learn to read, a person will never reach the same level of competency.'' Palestinian attempts at alternative study during the school closures were quickly outlawed by the Israeli army, which claimed they were organized to incite civil unrest. Last month, <PERSON> Mahshi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rishmawi </PERSON> were called into <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>'s military headquarters after they distributed home study assignments They said the army ordered them to stop. `` They said the school closures were to pressure parents into understanding what they were losing and home study counteracted this,'' <PERSON> Mahshi </PERSON> said. The frequent clashes and mass arrests of the uprising _ in which at least 322 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been killed _ have also taken a psychological toll on students. `` Our first job every day is to play the clown and try to get the children to smile. They arrive frowning and sad, traumatized by some family encounter with the army,'' <PERSON> Rishmawi </PERSON> said. `` But we just do n't have the resources to deal with the more severe effects of stress: nightmares, bed wetting, depression,'' he said. Enrollment in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools has dropped considerably as Arab-American students left for schools in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and hundreds of others enrolled in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> schools. The student body at the <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> is expected to be 250, compared with 470 students last year. <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> English </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Nahala </PERSON> <PERSON> Assali </PERSON> estimates about 25 percent of the territory's 18,000 college students also left to study in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the elsewhere in Arab world. `` Anything that causes our young people to leave the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> is consistent with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> aims,'' she said.

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Nov. 10-20 with 1,084 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The phone numbers were selected randomly by computer, and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a 3 percentage-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 of 20 times. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ 5 points, for example, for Southerners. Other sources of potential error in polls include the wording and order of questions. The questions and responses in this poll follow; because of rounding, sums may not total 100: 1. Do you celebrate Christmas? Yes: 96 percent. No: 5 percent. 2.

<HEAD>Americans To Spend At Least $200 For Christmas Gifts, Poll Shows</HEAD>

 Most Americans intend to spend at least $ 200 on Christmas gifts this season, and one in four will spend at least $ 500, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll shows. Given those expenses, it's not surprising that a vast majority of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> _ 85 percent _ say they believe Christmas is too commercialized. Still, a plurality celebrate the holiday as a religious, not just a social, occasion. The survey of 1,084 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was conducted by telephone Nov. 10-20. The poll suggested that Americans remain strongly religious and have a deep fondness for the Christmas season. But it also showed significant differences in viewpoints among regions and age groups. Eighty-nine percent of those answering the poll identified themselves as Catholic or Protestant; the rest were Jewish, `` other,'' or had no religion. Ninety-six percent of respondents said they celebrate Christmas and 87 percent said they look forward to the Christmas holidays. About a third thinks of Christmas as mainly a social holiday, and about one-quarter regard it as primarily religious. The largest number _ 38 percent _ consider it religious and social. The poll also showed that nearly seven in 10 Americans are churchgoers, and four in 10 had been to church the week before the poll. Sixty-four percent said they generally go to church on Christmas. The poll suggested that Americans are in a somewhat more generous mood this holiday season than they were seven years ago, when an AP-NBC News poll showed that 69 percent intended to cut back on gift spending. In the new poll, nearly half said they'll spend the same as they have for the last few years; 27 percent will spend more. Only 23 percent said they intend to spend less. Sixty-nine percent said they intend to give gifts to at least 10 other people, and only 3 percent will be giving to none. Twenty percent will be giving to 20 or more people. Finally, seven in 10 people say they usually receive the gifts they really want; one in four do n't. The poll indicated that Americans who live in the South and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> have stronger religious traditions than those in the West and <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION>, and that black Americans are more religiously observant than whites, conservatives more than liberals, Catholics more than Protestants. For instance, 75 percent of those in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and 71 percent of those in the north-central states said they attended church services during the year, compared with 69 percent in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and 57 percent in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Eighty-three percent of blacks are churchgoers, compared with 69 percent of whites; 75 percent of conservatives compared with 56 percent of liberals; 76 percent of Catholics compared with 71 percent of Protestants. The poll also showed that younger adults are more likely to look forward to Christmas than their elders, and that they also are much more likely to view Christmas as a primarily social, not religious, holiday. Overall the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, but a somewhat higher error rate for answers involving subgroups. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, Va.-based communications company, publishes the <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>, The Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 From the Jewish state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to the Moslem nation of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the earthquake in Soviet <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> spurred nations across the world to set aside political differences and rush to the aid of the stricken Soviets. Children opened their piggy banks, musicians offered their art and a search dog wearing a Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON> on his chest was flown into the region as part of an international mission of mercy. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> relief organizations announced that 23 countries worldwide collected about $ 44 million in aid, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. In <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, the donations were so great they could n't all fit onto one plane. A Soviet aircraft loaded with about 80 search and rescue workers, six dogs and 9 -LCB- tons of medical supplies and winter clothing was delayed for hours at Mirabel Airport on Sunday while workers tried to cram everything aboard. Armenians in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were organizing a medical team and collecting money to help victims, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. Though Soviet-Iranian relations improved somewhat with the increasing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, they have often been strained. Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has backed Moslem rebels fighting Soviet and government troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a 42-member Israeli rescue team headed by an army general flew to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, to help search for earthquake survivors. The team included experts specially trained in operating heavy cranes, several doctors, and an Alsatian shepherd dog named <PERSON> Tim </PERSON>, who is trained to sniff people under rubble and wore a red Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON> on a white chest cloth. Two other planes were scheduled to fly to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today with a 46-member medical team, equipment and 4 -LCB- tons of medical supplies. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> broke diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war and does not officially recognize the Jewish state, but relations have been gradually warming. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' Armenian community collected millions of dollars for relief. `` This little girl came with her grandfather, and she apparently had a piggy bank that she was saving for Christmas. She said ` Grandpa, instead of me getting something, why do n't I give this''' said <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barsamian </PERSON>, who is working with the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> chapter. A hastily assembled telethon that ran from midnight Saturday to 6 a.m. Sunday on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> drew $ 2.9 million in pledges, said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> station KSCI-TV. The telethon was shown on that station, on cable channels throughout <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and on independent stations in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters that four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes had already arrived in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to provide help. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> branch of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Narodny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the Soviet state bank, said late Sunday that donations to earthquake relief from the British public had reached $ 1.04 million. Organizers of British relief efforts announced a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> concert to raise money for victims. Conductor <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Previn </PERSON>, flutist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Galway </PERSON> and cellist <PERSON> Mstislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> are among those scheduled to perform Saturday. Almost 30 tons of emergency relief supplies, mostly blankets and clothing, were flown out of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, officials said. The supplies were donated mainly by individuals who drove them to the airport from throughout southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Not all the relief efforts went smoothly. A Dutch medical relief crew was refused visas to assist in the rescue operations, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. The source said Soviet diplomats claimed no more foreign relief was needed. Some foreign relief workers said they ran into snags upon reaching the disaster areas. `` The relief effort until you reach the spot here has been very good,'' said <PERSON> Sverre </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilde </PERSON>, a Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officer. `` But here on the spot there is no control.''

 Illegal fireworks exploded in a crowded street market Sunday and started a chain reaction and fire that spread to five buildings, killing at least 61 people and injuring 45. `` We'll be searching all night. They're still finding bodies,'' said <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Padillo </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> commander at the scene. Floodlights lit the narrow street and an alley as rescuers dug into the night, putting bodies on stretchers, tagging them and putting them in ambulances. A bulldozer began plowing away the rubble. At least 61 people were killed, Commander <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> <PERSON> Guadarrama </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said early Monday. `` They ca n't get inside the storerooms, but they are full of bodies,'' said <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Castanon </PERSON> <PERSON> Romo </PERSON>, city director of medical services. `` You can no longer talk of survivors.'' At least 11 of the dead were children, officials said. <PERSON> Padillo </PERSON> said at least 45 people were injured, but an official on duty at <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> headquarters put the number at 83. Two firefighters were among the injured, medical workers said. The first explosion apparently was in a market stall set up in a narrow street leading to the popular Merced market and jammed with Christmas shoppers, said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. Fire spread to a two-story building of candy and fireworks shops, where fireworks also were stored, and to a building of candy shops next door. A city legal official, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON>, said the fireworks were being sold illegally. The shops `` were all full of people buying,'' <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>, another rescue worker said. After the explosions began, an estimated 500 people streamed from the building screaming, `` Get out, get out,'' said <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>, who was working in shoe store less than 100 feet away. `` At first it sounded like bullets. Then there were more and more and then the explosion,'' <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON> said. The narrow street was crowded with people buying fireworks for the celebration of the Day of the Virgin of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> on Monday. The explosion began with one crate of fireworks on the end of the street nearest the Merced, said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrade </PERSON>, who lives next to one of the buildings that caught fire and was in the street at the time. He said boxes of fireworks kept exploding down the street. Windows shattered throughout the block. Spent Chinese firecrackers, charred wood and comic books, twisted metal and tangles of high tension wires littered the street. As smoke billowed from the second floor of the building more than two hours after the fire was reported at 2:40 p.m., six young men on the third floor refused to leave. `` We're staying here to hold onto our things,'' one shouted to police. `` If it were your house, you'd do the same.'' Police sent firemen and police officers into the building. By about 5 p.m. fires had been extinguished in a six-story building across the street and a four-story building down the block. Some smoke also was coming from one floor of an apartment building. For at least an hour, the white smoke could be seen billowing from the site from more than two miles away. As darkness fell, a bulldozer began plowing away the rubble. Distraught relatives searched for missing relatives while vendors and residents vented anger at Mayor <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON>, who walked through the water-soaked debris of burned metal, canvas street stalls, and scattered merchandise. `` Many children died here, Mr. <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON>,'' said one man. Earlier, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, a leader of the area's commercial association, said it had been protesting illegal sales of fireworks. He complained that people who do n't belong to the group come in and sell fireworks without permits during the holidays. `` These present a great danger ... to the shops,'' he said. District Attorney <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> <PERSON> Lechuga </PERSON> said that fireworks are illegal to sell without a permit. `` This does not mean there is going to be an attack on Mexican culture,'' he said. `` These things -LRB- fireworks -RRB- are part of Mexican culture.'' `` It's a case of corruption,'' said <PERSON> Andrade </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Angelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Peredo </PERSON>. `` We do n't want street vendors selling fireworks here.'' For years, the Merced was the main market in this city of 18 million, supplying dozens of other markets and individual customers. A new main market was built on the edge of the city in 1982, but the Merced remains important because of tradition and its location about half a mile from the main Zocalo Plaza in a densely populated area.

 Four turtles wielding <LOCATION> Ninja </LOCATION> weapons, the brainchildren of a sandwich maker and a self-described hack cartoonist, are threatening to move into the top 10 of the Christmas toy market. `` They are just flying off the shelves,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, a toy industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poors </ORGANIZATION>. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have hit No. 11 in the Toy & amp; Hobby World charts of best sellers just four years after they were conceived by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON> during a late-evening sketching duel. Stores report they ca n't keep up with demand for the goofy turtles with their slice-and-dice arm action and their silly one-liners -LRB- `` One good turtle deserves another'' -RRB-. `` It's insane,'' said <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON>, 26. `` <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> and I really had no idea what we were unleashing. We were just two wild-eyed kids who just wanted to do comic books.'' They keep shop in a run-down building on a back street of this college town. Eastman, then an occasional student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, said he tracked down <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>, who scraped out a living by drawing illustrations for local newspapers, in 1982 because their cartoons looked alike. They became fast friends, joined by a love for <ORGANIZATION> Marvel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comics </ORGANIZATION> illustrator <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>. The turtles were created after what <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON> called a heavy dose of `` T.J. Hooker'' and `` Love Boat'' at an apartment the two men shared while <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>'s fiancee finished her studies at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamsphire </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> was still free-lancing cartoons. Eastman got by making sandwiches at a restaurant. `` We had been watching a bunch of horrible TV and we started drawing and throwing the stuff at each other,'' Eastman said last week. `` We found we had this little beastie that we really fell in love with.'' The beast soon had three brothers, all named after Renaissance painters, and a weird history involving a pool of goo in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> sewer and a rat with the powers of a Ninja master. As the story goes, the turtles were covered by the muck through a random series of odd accidents. They mutated and grew up under the rat's tutelage, evolving into superturtles with a taste for pizza and for doing battle with the Shredder, leader of the most feared assassins in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Valentine considers the turtles the natural descendants of the tin soldier with appealingly distasteful roots in radioactive gunk. `` Kids are into slime,'' he said. `` Anything to gross out their little sisters.'' Their creators scraped together $ 1,200 and printed 3,000 copies of the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic book. The comics sold out in three weeks and <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donatello </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michaelangelo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> were propelled to fame on T-shirts, cereal boxes and Saturday morning TV. Even avid fan <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> was filmed reading a turtles comic in the farewell episode of `` Magnum, P.I.'' `` It goes way beyond luck,'' <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON> said of their success. `` We had one of the best black-and-white comics around. We worked hard to get it to the point where <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> picked up on it.'' <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> licensing agent, managed to entice a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company, Playmates, into investing $ 2.5 million in an animated television show and launching a line of 10 figurines. The turtles were helped by the phenomenon of specialty comic book stores that have sprung up in the last five years, which have opened a market for the offbeat. `` Everybody says, ` You guys must be zillionaires now.' Far from it,'' said <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON>. He said, however, that the collaborators' annual income is in the six figures and they now have eight artists working on the comic strips and other ventures. The turtles have long since moved their comic book haunts from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> sewers to the town where their creators have settled. `` They can still get into the city easily from here,'' <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON> said. `` And we can use people we know for characters.''

 By Christmas, four teams of reindeer from <LOCATION> Operation </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> will have logged 50,000 miles and 110 appearances at shopping malls and resorts across the country. `` We have to make hay while the snow flies,'' said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillaspie </PERSON>, who manages the ranch for <ORGANIZATION> Troutman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> with her husband, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>. `` Santa's got one night and we've got six weeks,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillaspie </PERSON>. Other reindeer from the ranch are on exhibit at <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo. `` The only part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> we do n't hit is the Deep South,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Gillaspie </PERSON>. `` Part of the reason is the heat, part is because we just have n't marketed the area and haven generated enough interest.'' Most of the reindeer's bookings are through mall merchants associations for the holiday season, she said. Each team is accompanied by two trained handlers. Mrs. <PERSON> Gillaspie </PERSON> said she knows of no serious competition in her reindeer-for-hire business. The only herd she knows of that's larger is at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> and it's for research. <ORGANIZATION> Troutman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION>, an offshoot of a <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> department store chain based in <LOCATION> Eugene </LOCATION>, has no salesmen to market the reindeer. `` Just me,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gillaspie </PERSON> said. `` What started out as a June-through-January job has become year-round work,'' she said. `` But it really does n't get fast and furious until the summer months. `` People do n't want to think about Christmas in February, and neither do I. But we get started early.'' When <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zumstein </PERSON> started <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claus </ORGANIZATION> back in 1950, he knew little about reindeer. `` I got the idea from watching a Christmas show with papier-mache reindeer,'' said <PERSON> Zumstein </PERSON>, who lives a few miles away from this central <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> town now that he has sold the ranch. `` I wondered why the dickens people did n't have real reindeer, so I questioned around.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> zookeepers told him that they had tried to keep reindeer, but the arctic natives died. <PERSON> Zumstein </PERSON>, who was in the fuel business, had studied animal husbandry and decided to apply to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> for permits to buy 10 reindeer from Eskimos in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. He flew his first batch into <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and trucked them to <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON>, where he figured the cool, dry, high-desert climate was more suitable than the rain in the <LOCATION> Willamette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. But they all died. He flew to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and got more. And by trial and error he figured out how to keep the animals from dying and how to breed them. `` Every time I had bad luck I learned a little bit,'' said <PERSON> Zumstein </PERSON>. He developed a feed formula that worked and learned to watch out for parasites that overcame the deer when they were transplanted to a warmer climate. At his peak, <PERSON> Zumstein </PERSON> had 80 reindeer on tour to places such as <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> as well as the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He also was selling reindeer. When <PERSON> Zumstein </PERSON> got the herd up to 100 head, he figured he had it under control. He sold out about 10 years ago. <PERSON> Gillaspie </PERSON> now trains the animals to accept a harness and pull a sleigh. Of course, the reindeer are popular with children. During a recent visit to the ranch, some children climbed on the fence at <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claus </ORGANIZATION> and pointed out one named <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON>, even though the young calf with the nubby little antlers had a brown nose like the others. `` His nose does n't glow because it's sunny,'' said 5-year-old <PERSON> Jewelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Urell </PERSON>, who was visiting from the Learning Tree preschool in nearby <LOCATION> Prineville </LOCATION>. `` It'll glow by Christmas time. I can wait.''

 A hastily assembled telethon to aid victims of the devastating earthquake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> drew nearly $ 3 million in pledges, and one child emptied her piggy bank of money she had saved for Christmas presents to help. Other offers of assistance poured in from around the country, including teams of search dogs from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, kidney dialysis machines from an Armenian congregation in <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and a planeload of medical personnel and equipment from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` People want to help people in need and we all think that, ` There but for the grace of God go I,''' said Dr. <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, medical director of the Seattle-King County Disaster Team. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> and about 100 volunteers spent the weekend lining up everything from operating equipment and wheelchairs to kerosene generators and cooking stoves. The group is sending 40 to 50 medical personnel and nearly 100,000 pounds of medical equipment aboard a donated cargo plane that's due to take off Tuesday and arrive in the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on Wednesday. For the quake-stricken region where tens of thousands have died and hundreds of thousands were left homeless, no offer of help was too small. `` Little children have come in and given us their Christmas donations,'' said <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barsamian </PERSON>, who is working with the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` This little girl came with her grandfather and she apparently had a piggy bank that she was saving for Christmas. She said ` Grandpa, instead of me getting something, why do n't I give this?''' Thousands of Armenians prayed Sunday in churches around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The point of it is, they are all Armenians and they are all our relatives,'' <PERSON> Odette </PERSON> <PERSON> Hambarsoomian </PERSON>, 28, said while waiting for Mass to begin at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apostolic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>. `` It's something that is going to be in Armenian memories forever.'' For many, the relief efforts were combined with anxious strivings for information. `` We have tried 300 times to call <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but they say there are no lines,'' said <PERSON> Saro </PERSON> <PERSON> Diashian </PERSON>, a computer programmer with many relatives in the hard-hit city of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, who attended services at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. `` All we can do is just wait and pray and give some help.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, word reached <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazarian </PERSON> through relatives in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that two cousins had perished in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>. `` They were in an office and the entire office building collapsed,'' he said after Mass at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vartan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's terrible, terrible I could n't sleep all night. I mean, the whole family is so upset. It's ... that pain _ you just ca n't describe it.'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> station KSCI-TV received $ 2.9 million in pledges toward supplies with its spur-of-the-moment telethon, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Good </PERSON>. The show ran from midnight Saturday to 6 a.m. Sunday on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and was shown in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The congregation at Holy Martyrs Armenian <ORGANIZATION> Apostolic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, bought four kidney dialysis machines, which Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had requested for treatment of crushing injuries. In addition to the machines, which are to be shipped Tuesday, 30 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> volunteered to go to the devastated area, said <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chakalozian </PERSON>. On Saturday, an <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> jet left <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with more than a ton of supplies and $ 1 million for quake victims. Chairman <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, 90, who has long had close ties to Soviet leaders, arranged the flight. Alaskan officials grateful for Soviet help in freeing two trapped whales in October were arranging to send teams of rescue dogs and handlers. Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said the teams could be in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> by Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> participated in a Mass with about 200 Armenians on Sunday and announced that a special collection made at churches in the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archdiocese </ORGANIZATION> would go toward relief efforts. `` We are working primarily to raise money, because we are not exactly sure what is needed, except for medical supplies,'' said Rev. <PERSON> Yeznig </PERSON> <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vartan </LOCATION>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the diocesan headquarters for the eastern branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` The response has been tremendous in every sense, both from Armenians and non-Armenians.'' A few minutes earlier, <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blossom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cashdan </PERSON> walked into the church offices with an armload of coats and sweaters. `` We're Jewish, but people are people,'' <PERSON> Cashdan </PERSON> said `` This is an overwhelming disaster, so we just felt a need to help.''

<HEAD>Workers Still Search for Survivors in Collapsed Apartment Building</HEAD>

 Outside the ruins of 270 <ORGANIZATION> Sverdlovsk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION>, families picked at the heap of wreckage that used to be home and prayed that relatives still buried in the rubble might somehow survive. Several people were pulled from the 50-apartment building alive immediately after Wednesday's earthquake, but by Sunday, relatives of the missing were losing hope. Stacks of red, black or unfinished wood coffins were piled on street corners. <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Manoyan </PERSON> knew that his wife, mother-in-law and a brother-in-law were dead. The three were in a ground floor apartment when the quake struck. <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazaryan </PERSON>'s husband had found his son but not his wife, who had come home from work for her lunch break when the earth began to shake and the long, five-story concrete building collapsed. `` We do n't know whether anyone is alive or not,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Kazaryan </PERSON>'s husband, a laborer. `` I went to the school where my son studies. The building was ruined, but he was alive. Then I came home and started searching for my wife.'' People were trying to dig out their belongings from one end of the 15-year-old building, which was built on a slight rise above the street and had slid into a heap by the roadside. Some worked in a pile of rubble, digging through the ruins. Others simply milled about. A young man was accused of trying to steal something, and shouting erupted. Soldiers arrested the man and led him away. Everywhere, officials and rescuers pleaded for more cranes and heavy equipment to drag slabs of concrete and twisted pillars off trapped people. At one site, rescuers worked feverishly with saws, torches, hammers and crowbars to free a family of seven discovered near the top of what was a nine-story apartment building. Survivors who spoke about the tragedy described a series of three or four quakes separated by brief pauses. Mayor <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirokofyan </PERSON> told a group of foreign correspondents that recently constructed apartment buildings were not built to withstand such a severe temblor _ even though <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> is in an area of frequent earthquakes. Choking back tears, the mayor told reporters he lost 15 relatives. Hundreds of bonfires fueled by cardboard, trash or debris provided the only heat for people who had spent four nights on the streets. They sent a pall of smoke over the city of 250,000 people. `` I do n't have anywhere to live. I am homeless,'' cried an old woman walking out of rescue headquarters, where officials had put her on a list for new housing. <PERSON> Manoyan </PERSON>, a machinist who found his wife and relatives dead, appealed to the foreign reporters, who were touring the disaster area at the invitation of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` As a member of the Armenian nation, I ask you to give us help,'' he said. `` We need equipment. The city is in ruins.'' Some aid that was given proved useless. After people had been digging through the rubble with their hands for three days, a crane arrived Saturday. But the next day, it was parked beside the ruins, motionless. Workers said it was too small.

<HEAD>Indicted Bakker Urges Forgiveness For Accusers At Service</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 To shouts of `` hallelujah,'' <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> preached for the first time since his fraud and conspiracy indictment and urged followers of his new church to forgive his accusers. `` They ask us, ` Why do n't you attack your enemies?''' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said, his voice rising. `` The devil wants me to renounce my salvation and attack, attack, attack. The Bible says ` Love your enemies.''' `` I'm not going to lift a finger to attack my enemies. I'm not going to lift a finger to vindicate me.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` That will put cold chills down your enemy's spine.'' During the service for his <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> never mentioned the 24-count indictment issued last week by a federal grand jury investigating PTL. `` I feel a miracle,'' he told 400 worshipers Sunday gathered at a roller skating rink. `` And the harder the devil fights, the bigger the miracle that's coming.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987 after admitting to a 1980 extramarital sexual encounter with church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy reorganization in June 1987 and a court-appointed trustee has been trying to sell its assets to pay creditors. In Fort Mill, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, an auction was scheduled for this afternoon of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s 2,200-acre property, which includes a 500-room hotel, a theme park, television studio and a 2,000-seat church. The only certain bidder, <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, has let it be known he intends to offer a total of less than $ 70 million cash. A month ago, he said he would pay $ 115 million, $ 50 million of it cash. During Sunday's service, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> talked about his reaction to being fingerprinted and having his mugshot taken at the federal courthouse in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. `` I looked up at all those wanted posters and I thought, ` No one is smiling _ so I smiled,''' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` If I'm going to be on the walls of post offices, I'm going to smile.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, plan to tape several television specials at their home south of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. `` The old adrenalin is flowing again,'' he said. `` We're excited to be able to minister to the people again.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> joined her husband on stage, singing `` This Too Shall Pass,'' and telling stories of well-wishers who had greeted her in restaurants and shopping malls. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> won repeated cries of `` hallelujah'' and `` you got that right'' from worshipers seated under the fluorescent lights and mirrored balls of the rink. At one point, most of them left their metal chairs to gather around him and raise their hands in prayer. As one elderly woman left the service, she told reporters, `` The worse they do <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, the more we're going to love him.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> did not allow reporters inside the building. Some of his remarks, however, could be heard through the door in the lobby. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and three of his former associates were indicted a week ago today after a 16-month federal grand jury investigation into the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> television ministry. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, 48, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, 57, his former top deputy at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, were accused of diverting more than $ 4 million of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money to support their `` lavish and extravagant'' lifestyles.

 A passenger train ran into the back of a commuter train in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> this morning, killing two people and injuring at least 50, a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The collision occurred at the height of the morning rush hour near the <LOCATION> Clapham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> station, said the spokesman. He spoke anonymously in keeping with British custom. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambulance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the crash occured at the bottom of an embankment, making it difficult to reach the injured. However, news reports said one train toppled down the embankment following the collision. Three local hospitals have been alerted, said the ambulance spokesman, also speaking anonymously, and more than 100 firefighters were at the scene, along with a fleet of ambulances and a mobile surgical unit.

 <PERSON> Josh </PERSON> <PERSON> Farnsworth </PERSON> stood on a mountainside with snow blowing around him and the wind cutting through his coat. He reluctantly pulled off his mittens to write down the name of the 40-foot tree towering in front of him. `` I think I'm going to call it ` Three Splits,''' said the 9-year-old, as he scrutinized the maple that split at its base into three separate trunks. Then, he measured the base with his scarf and paced off the distance from the tree to a trail marker 15 feet away. <PERSON> Josh </PERSON> and other pupils at <ORGANIZATION> Derby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in neary <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION> will use the information to find sponsors for dozens of trees along the 265-mile Long Trail, a hiking trail that runs north-south from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The proceeds will be used by the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> to buy some of the 67 miles of unprotected, privately owned land along the trail. `` The Long Trail is one of the treasures of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. This is one of the few true wilderness experiences on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>,'' said teacher <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Westin </PERSON>. The project also is introducing dozens of fourth, fifth and sixth graders to a different way of learning science, history and math, and a way to apply their skills to benefit their community, he said. The Long Trail program, which includes a pupil-produced history book about the trail, began this fall at a school that has earned a reputation for developing unusual, creative projects that extend beyond its red brick borders and into the 4,200-member community on the Vermont-Quebec border. The school just won an award from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and Local History for last year's project, a set of 109 short stories the pupils prepared and read on a radio station. The school also was honored recently as a finalist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s A + award for its projects, <PERSON> Westin </PERSON> said The projects begin in <PERSON> Westin </PERSON>'s `` Challenge Room,'' a classroom where he was told five years ago to establish a program for gifted pupils. But the program is `` really open to anybody in the school who has a serious interest. It's not just for kids with high IQs,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, guidance counselor. Individual pupils participate for six weeks, three days a week, about 45 minutes each day. Or the projects can involve entire classes, like <PERSON> Josh </PERSON>'s. Earlier this month, he and his classmates boarded a bus for the half-hour drive to the Long Trail on <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Peak </PERSON>. Up on the trail, the youngsters fanned out to pick a tree. Ten-year-old <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenness </PERSON> sat in the snow in front of her tree, a gray birch with roots raised to form a hole above the soil. `` What does it look like?'' <PERSON> Westin </PERSON> asked. `` A troll's house,'' <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> answered. `` Oh, beautiful,'' he said in praise. <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> said the project helps her learn in a way that's more enjoyable than sitting at a desk. `` You learn about nature,'' agreed classmate <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Castl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> said the projects help develop an interest in the outdoors. `` I do n't think it's going to turn them all into environmentalists, and that's not our goal. But I would like them to be at least as aware as they are of video games or what's going on in sports.''

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s premier was relieved of his position today for health reasons and resigned from the ruling Politburo, the country's official news agency said. The Korean <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> report, monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Gun </PERSON> <PERSON> Mo </PERSON> will be replaced by <PERSON> Yon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyong </PERSON> <PERSON> Muk </PERSON>, a Politburo member and secretary of the Korean Workers' -LRB- Communist -RRB- Party. It said the changes were approved at an extraordinary session of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> had been premier since Dec. 29, 1986. Little is known about him. On Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> KCNA </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>'s 15-member standing committee had requested an extraordinary meeting of the assembly. That prompted speculation the party could have important decisions to be approved by the congress. Another official report, from <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pyongyang </ORGANIZATION>, said a son of party leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, was appointed ambassador to <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> became ambassador to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in August but returned to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in September to protest <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s agreement with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to exchange permanent trade offices in their capital cities. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> was director-general of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> prior to his appointment as ambassador to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The appointment of a new ambassador to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was not announced, according to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> news agency that monitors communist bloc broadcasts. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is believed to have downgraded its relations with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to one requiring the exchange of deputy ambassadors, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> also approved the appointment of <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Song </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryong </PERSON> to replace <PERSON> Yong </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyong </PERSON> <PERSON> Muk </PERSON> as secretary of the party's central committee, <ORGANIZATION> KCNA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hyon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jun </PERSON> <PERSON> Guk </PERSON> was appointed editor-in-chief of the official newspaper, the <PERSON> Rodong </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinmun </PERSON>, a position formerly held by <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, a central committee member, was appointed to <PERSON> Hyon </PERSON>'s position as head of the party's international department. The assembly meeting came at a time when some of communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s closest allies are improving their ties with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Since the Summer Olympics in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have increased their economic and cultural contacts with the capitalist South. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have agreed to exchange trade offices with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

They said the hijacker was not violent and was shocked when he was arrested on Grand Turk, part of the British colony of Turks and <LOCATION> Caicos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> southeast of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. `` He was horrified to realize he had been tricked,'' said passenger <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blattner </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, identified the would-be hijacker as <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 26, who left <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> during the 1980 Mariel boatlift <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrence </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office said the suspect remained in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turk </LOCATION> and extradition proceedings were scheduled to begin today. A device that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> claimed to be a bomb proved to be harmless, officials said. <PERSON> Blattner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> apparently wanted to return to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to see his ailing mother. `` A couple of times he leaned over some people and told them everything's going to be all right,'' said passenger <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Patri </PERSON>. The pilot of the Flight 469 was able to get permission to land on <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turk </LOCATION> island where police were able to convince <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> he was in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Motta </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, who acted as an interpreter during the hijacking, said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> tapped him on the shoulder and gave him a letter that said in red ink `` This is a hijacking.'' He told <PERSON> Motta </PERSON> he had a bomb and said it would be activated by his watch. `` He said ` I want to stay in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Please tell the captain, we go to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' according to <PERSON> Motta </PERSON>. <PERSON> Motta </PERSON> said the man was very nervous, and that the plane banked to land on the first island it approached. `` As they landed he saw a fire engine -LRB- and several cars -RRB- and said ` Really, we are not in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. I know the cars in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,''' <PERSON> Motta </PERSON> said. The pilot and the interpreter convinced him that a civilian would have to greet him, and when he left the plane he was arrested, <PERSON> Motta </PERSON> said. It was the first hijacking of a domestic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flight since May 3, 1986, when a man hijacked a <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> commuter jet with 11 other passengers and two crewmembers en route to <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and demanded to go to <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. The plane landed at <LOCATION> Hillsboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and the hijacker was arrested. Hijackings to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> were common in the late 1960s and early'70s, prompting the security measures now commonplace at airports. The only previous hijacking involving a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial flight this year occurred in October, when three soldiers in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> stormed aboard an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> during a period of political turmoil in their country. On May 25, a flight mechanic without a pilot's license stole a private jet in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> News </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and took it on a 1,600-mile joyride to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, where he shot himself as authorities closed in.

<TEXT>
 Strewn throughout the charred, water-soaked debris of what hours before had been a thriving street market were the fireworks that set the market and five buildings ablaze. It happened Sunday, the eve of the Day of Virgin of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>. One of the ways Mexicans honor their patron saint is by shooting skyrockets, Roman candles and other fireworks. They keep firing them sporadically through New Year's. Though barred by a little-enforced law, fireworks abound in markets like that on Corona Street, especially during national and religious holidays. A woman of about 60 said authorities have sometimes confiscated the fireworks. `` This year there was nobody. Nobody came to take the fireworks away,'' she said. `` The street was completely full of fireworks. It was full of people. The Day of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>. So many dead. My God.'' Authorities early today did n't know what ignited the fireworks, triggering the series of explosions and fire that killed at least 70 people. Some witnesses said a spilled gas tank was to blame, others a carelessly tossed cigarette. But the fire scarred both sides of <LOCATION> Corona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, whipping through the well-known Candy Market, an apartment building, two other structures containing apartments and shops, and yet another where fireworks were stored and sold. `` All these people, it took away part of their lives,'' said <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Guera </PERSON>, who has a market stall and ran to the scene after the first explosion. `` They lost everything, and they live from one day to the next.'' <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> rescue worker <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Guayaberra </PERSON> said 22 of the victims died in one structure next to the apartment building. `` Most of those found dead there were huddled together. Burned,'' he said. Many of them were on upper floors and apparently had shut themselves inside the building to escape the flames, dense curtain of smoke and popping fireworks outside, <PERSON> Guayaberra </PERSON> said. The smoke lifted to reveal the remnants of a bustling marketplace. A child's pail lay on its side in the muck; nearby, a pair of women's shoes. On a table sat blackened soot in the classic pyramid shape that fruit sellers use. Red, yellow and blue berries and the candy <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> street was known for were scattered about. Red and silver Christmas rope draped across the remains of a food stand. Dozens of gasoline cans, like those used to cook tacos and other typical Mexican fare at open-air stands, littered the street. And everywhere, in the grime of <LOCATION> Corona </LOCATION> street and an adjacent alleyway, were Chinese firecrackers, skyrockets and Roman candles.

<HEAD>Mayor Announces Candidacy For 2-Year Term</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> launched a bid to stay in office, saying he had `` kept our city together'' in troubled times after the death of Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> announced his candidacy Sunday for next year's special election as a new poll showed him trailing <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> in a one-on-one race for the Democratic nomination `` I look forward to the contest. I know it wo n't be easy,'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> told about 700 supporters at a rally at a downtown hotel. `` I need your help and your hard work and your prayers.'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, 54, enters a field of six other candidates who have announced they are vying for his job. The election will be for a two-year term, the remainder of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s second four-year term. `` In the past 12 months, I have been on the firing line day in an day out,'' he told his supporters. `` I've taken some shots, fairly and unfairly, but I have kept our city together and we've made great progress through some very difficult times.'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> was elected acting mayor by fellow aldermen during a raucous <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting last December after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the city's first black mayor, died of a heart attack. The new mayoral poll, published in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, showed <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> beating <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> by a margin of 59 percent to 30 percent. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> is the son of legendary Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who ruled <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for more than 20 years until his death in 1976. The telephone survey of 1,038 registered <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> voters showed <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> beating <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s chief rival for the support of black voters, by a 56-34 margin. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> are black. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would give <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> the toughest opposition in the mayoral race, garnering 40 percent to <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s 52 percent, according to the poll, which was conducted Dec. 2-5 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Saturday said he was not a candidate. Political analysts said the survey was very early and did not mean much. `` I do n't put much stock in December polls when the election is the last day of February, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> University </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> set April 4 as the date for a special election. The Democratic primary is scheduled for Feb. 28. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> has between $ 2 million and $ 3 million in a campaign war chest. `` He's got a large kitty, so obviously he's going to be able to get his message across,'' the analyst said The Democratic primary has generally been tantamount to winning the general election in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s recent history. But that changed somewhat in 1983 when a white <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate made a strong showing in a losing effort against <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The other announced Democratic candidates are <ORGANIZATION> Aldermen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloom </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and former state Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. Former <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Parks Superintendent <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> withdrew from the Democratic field the day after <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> announced his candidacy and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday said <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> also quit the race. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Howlett </PERSON>, son of a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> secretary of state, is the only announced <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate.

<HEAD>Prominent Union Leader Given Bail After 900 Days In Prison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an unexpected move, a court today granted bail to a prominent union leader and four other black activists held for up to 30 months while on trial for treason. The <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> granted bail to <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON>, head of the country's largest metalworkers union, and four co-defendants charged with attempting a political takeover of <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>, an inpoverished black township adjoining <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON> was released on bail of 10,000 rand, or $ 4,200. The others each paid $ 2,100. Four of the men, including Mayekiso, spent more than 900 days in custody, while the fifth had been held almost 700 days. The case was adjourned last month and is to resume in February. The trial has attracted international attention due to <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON>'s position as general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metalworkers </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and because many activists view the prosecution as an attempt to stifle peaceful anti-apartheid activity Conditions of bail bar the defendants from entering <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>, addressing meetings or granting press interviews. The government alleges that the defendants organized rent and consumer boycotts and sought to undermine the security forces in 1985 and 1986, the height of nationwide black unrest. <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> was one of the most militant townships at the time, and dozens of people were killed in clashes with security forces. In several recent court cases, authorities have taken actions designed to give the appearance of leniency toward anti-apartheid activists. Last week, a judge in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> sentenced four prominent activists to prison terms of six to 12 years following their conviction on treason in a three-year trial. Most observers expected the sentences to be much harsher. In November, President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> granted clemency to the <ORGANIZATION> Sharpeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION>, a group of blacks convicted of murder in the mob killing of a black township councilor. Their deaths sentences provoked an international outcry, and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> decided to give them lengthy prison sentences instead. In the past two years, the government has sought to restore control by detaining or restricting leaders of <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Alexandra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> while undertaking a $ 38 million development program in the township. <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>, wedged between affluent white suburbs, is one of the country's most squalid urban townships. Many of the 120,000 residents lack electricity and toilets, and water comes from communal taps.

 Israeli soldiers killed two guerrillas before dawn today in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, a military spokesman said. No Israeli troops were hurt in the clash, the spokesman said. Troops opened fire after encountering the guerrillas during a routine patrol in the central sector of the 6-to-10-mile-wide security zone near the village Barachit, the army said. The guerrillas were heavily armed with submachine guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled grenades, the army said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio said they were probably planning to attack an Israeli target within the security belt.

<HEAD>Teen-ager Says Parents Taught Her To Use Cocaine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The parents of a teen-age girl were arrested after she told authorities they taught her how to use cocaine and how to cook it into the highly addictive drug `` crack.'' <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hupman </PERSON>, 36, and his wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, 34, were free on bail Sunday. Their five children, ranging in age from 6 to 17, were placed in the custody of grandparents. <PERSON> Hupman </PERSON> told authorities he figured his 17-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON>, would be exposed to cocaine and `` he wanted her to be exposed to it at home,'' police Lt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. The Hupmans were arrested after <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> told a school counselor they had a drug problem and were openly using cocaine, police said. The two were booked on four counts of furnishing cocaine to a minor and released on $ 25,000 bail Saturday night. Miss <PERSON> Hupman </PERSON> told authorities she used cocaine four times, two of those times in the form of crack, he said. The teen-ager said she saw her parents use cocaine for the first time in the summer of 1986. Several months ago, she began asking questions about the drug's effects and if she could try it, said police officer <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindholm </PERSON>. `` He said, ` Here. Have some,''' <PERSON> Lindholm </PERSON> said about the father's reaction At first, Miss <PERSON> Hupman </PERSON> was disturbed by the police intervention with the family, but state child abuse laws require school officials to inform police when they receive such a report, <PERSON> Lindholm </PERSON> said. `` Her initial reasoning was not to throw them in jail or anything but to get help for her or them,'' he said. `` She was worried the family might crack up and her parents might die.'' <PERSON> Hupman </PERSON> is a printer at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and his wife works there as a patient relations specialist. Mountain View is about 35 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.

 Jazz musician <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> got into a bidding war he did n't want _ and had to lose in order to win. <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, 74, was enjoying some jazz at a benefit art auction given Sunday by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. The Alliance was honoring six artists, including <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, the late collage artist <PERSON> Romare </PERSON> <PERSON> Bearden </PERSON> and theatrical producer <PERSON> Vy </PERSON> <PERSON> Higginsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> is a fan of <PERSON> Higginsen </PERSON>, whose `` Mama, I Want to Sing'' has been billed as the longest running off-Broadway play produced by a black. `` I was in her lobby and said she needs some pictures in here,'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> recalled. So when the signature acrylic painting `` Piano Man'' by <PERSON> Bearden </PERSON> protege <PERSON> Verna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> came up for bid, <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> was ready. `` I'm going to get this picture for Vy,'' he thought. But <PERSON> Higginsen </PERSON> began bidding for `` Piano Man'' too. The price went up and up, until <PERSON> Higginsen </PERSON> won at $ 2,500. <PERSON> Higginsen </PERSON> was elated at winning, but even more so a few minutes later, when the auctioneer told her <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> would pay for the painting. `` That was the least I could do,'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> said, adding that the former magazine publisher had helped many black artists over the years. `` I was absolutely thrilled. I was very interested in that painting,'' <PERSON> Higginsen </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Labor, Likud Tussle Over Guidelines For Joint Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc renewed negotiations today on forming a joint government, and officials said a major point of conflict involved right-wing plans to build 40 Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> ordered talks restarted Sunday night after a 10-day lull. The party chiefs set up three-member negotiating teams to finalize a coalition agreement that would bring the country's two largest political blocs back into a broad-based government. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the two teams met in secret locations today and focused on guidelines for a new government. The radio said there was growing pressure for <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to become finance minister, a less prestigious post than his current position as foreign minister. The radio said the negotiators agreed to continue the 10-member Inner Cabinet with equal representation from both parties. The body decides major security and foreign policy issues. The liberal daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> said today the two parties have agreed to set a timetable for dealing with electoral reform, which appeared aimed at reducing the influence of small religious parties that currently hold the balance of power. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has been trying to forge a government since <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won a slight edge over <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, 40 seats to 39, in the Nov. 1 election for the 120-member parliament. In an apparent effort to avoid making concessions on religious and political issues _ some of which deeply angered American Jews _ <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> turned back to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> after appearing close to an agreement with small religious and nationalist parties. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s talks with the small parties continue, however, and officials close to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> did not rule out the small parties joining whatever government is formed. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> adviser, expressed the hope that talks with Labor could be wrapped up in two or three days. But a <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> aide who demanded anonymity predicted negotiations would go down to the Dec. 26 deadline, when <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> must present a new government. <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said the policy guidelines should be substantially the same as those laid down for the current coalition government, which was formed after stalemated elections in 1984. `` Some adjustments and additions are needed. For example, we insist that more emphasis be given to building new Jewish villages -LRB- in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> -RRB- as economic conditions allow,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> did not favor unlimited settlement building. He indicated that if Labor joined the government, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> would not be obligated to carry out an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Tehiya </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-settlement party, to build 40 new settlements. An official close to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> would have to break its agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Tehiya </ORGANIZATION>. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> does n't break the promise, there is no way Labor can enter,'' he said. There are more than 130 Jewish settlements with about 70,000 Jews living in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. They are surrounded by 1.5 million Palestinians. <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> wanted to preserve existing policy guidelines on the peace issue. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> demands direct talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Arabs, whereas <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> supports an international conference as an opening for those talks. An official close to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> indicated one way to bridge the gap might be to propose talks under joint Soviet-American sponsorship. `` The attitude towards the Soviets is different today, so maybe this will help,'' he said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also will insist that any new policy initiatives be cleared in advance with the prime minister. But Israeli newspapers indicated Labor wanted freedom of maneuver to explore peace options and other political policy issues. Labor officials indicated they would insist on the right to vote against religious legislation such as the so-called `` who is a Jew'' bill, which proposes giving <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Orthodox rabbinate final say over the sensitive issue of conversions.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said today his outlawed trade union is ready for talks on reforming the Polish system and strikes should be a last resort. The Nobel Peace Prize winner spoke before returning home from his first trip abroad since martial law was imposed in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1981. By allowing him to travel, authorities gave implicit recognition of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s importance as a public figure. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to attend ceremonies Saturday marking the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. `` There is a -LRB- reform -RRB- process that we want to speed up and the fact that we are here is evidence of a quickening,'' said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. On Nov. 30, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> debated the chief of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist-backed official union in a live broadcast on national television. The uncensored debate was the first time since 1983 that the Solidarity leader has appeared on Polish television. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said the Polish `` system is moving in a good direction. But it is going by foot while the rest of the world is going by car. It is necessary to accelerate the process.'' `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> needs peace and pluralism. There is a place for both -LRB- Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> and Solidarity,'' he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he continued to favor negotiations to include the government, church and opposition. The government offered to hold the talks following two waves of strikes this year. But the talks reached an impasse after the government refused to legalize the banned union and Solidarity demanded a signal the government would consider the legalization before it would enter talks. He said the discussion was still necessary. `` My union has wanted it for a long time. But we should be considered free and independent. Under this condition we are ready right away,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> does n't need any more strikes now, because strikes are a last resort,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. He said the union `` should struggle to get the most we can for ourselves. But we also should remember to behave like good microorganisms and not destroy the system that we live in.'' During his visit, the smiling and ebullient <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met Soviet dissident physicist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> for the first time. The men, both Nobel laureates and leading dissidents, exchanged impressions of the fight for human rights in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said today he hoped to maintain contact with <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. `` He's a great thinker and a great, great man. But I do n't know what the possibilities will be for keeping in touch.'' Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Bronsilaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemerek </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> earlier in the day was at the departure of a truck loaded with supplies for victims of the Armenian earthquake. He said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> sent a letter on the truck to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` to express his Solidarity with the Soviet people.''

<TEXT>
 A quiet candlelight vigil by `` skinheads'' capped a day of demonstration and counterdemonstration by white supremacists and those who oppose their racist beliefs. The vigil Saturday night at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Whidbey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> marked the slaying four years ago of white supremacist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>. The 31-year-old founder of The Order died in a shootout with <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officers at a cabin near the park. Earlier Saturday, about 225 people chanted slogans and waved signs in a parking lot in this <LOCATION> Whidbey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> town, about 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. State police troopers and sheriff's deputies kept the two groups apart, and there were no violent incidents or arrests. A 17-year-old youth wearing a swastika button who wandered up to the crowd was surrounded by 30-40 people, who shouted `` Scum go home.'' Officers and protest organizers cooled things down, and the youth was escorted away by a park ranger. The counterdemonstrators included union members, civil rights activists, students, gay-rights activists and members of the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION>. They shouted slogans like `` We beat the fear by being here'' and `` Hey hey, ho ho, <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> bigots got to go.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jesus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, arrived shortly after most of the counterdemonstrators left, followed shortly by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON>, founder of White Aryan Resistance, based in <LOCATION> Fallbrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The vigil was organized largely by <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON>, leader of White Aryan Resistance Youth. Those arriving for the vigil gave Nazi-like salutes, called reporters `` scumbags'' and `` leeches,'' and hurled profanities at a photographer of Japanese ancestry. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Herler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> brought his daughters, <PERSON> Kristina </PERSON>, 12, and <PERSON> Eva </PERSON>, 10, for the memorial service. `` The skinheads, who everybody has this nightmare image of, it's incredible how intelligent and knowledgeable they are, compared with most people their age,'' he said His younger daughter said she hoped to become a skinhead when she got older, although women are not accepted as full-fledged members of the movement. Skinheads, generally young, favor close-cropped hair, military-style clothing and tattoos. Many are associated with the white supremacist <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and White Aryan Resistance, and have adopted Nazi beliefs. `` I'd die for my beliefs, so the least I could do is cut my hair,'' <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Herler </PERSON> said. About 60 people attended the vigil, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, state parks assistant regional supervisor. He said law enforcement officers were present but did not approach the group's campsite, and reporters and others were kept away. After <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>' death, 22 Order members were indicted on racketeering charges stemming from murders, arson, counterfeiting and armed robberies that netted more than $ 4 million to finance their operations, authorities said. Ten were convicted in December 1985, and 12 others pleaded guilty. Many were former members of Aryan Nations.

 An 11-year-old boy standing near the Christmas tree in his living room was killed when a stray bullet apparently fired by gang members crashed through a window and struck him in the back, police said today. The boy's death Sunday was the second blamed on gangs during the weekend; a 21-year-old woman who was seven months pregnant died Saturday after being shot in the head and abdomen. <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' fetus did not survive Authorities were seeking three assailants who drove by the boy's home in a large car in the community of <LOCATION> Willowbrook </LOCATION>, 12 miles south of downtown, sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Gabe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said The shooting `` definitely was gang-related, but we do not feel that this house or this boy was the subject of the shooting,'' sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> said. The boy, identified as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Polion </PERSON>, was with his mother and other family members inside their house, about 100 yards from the shooting scene, when the bullet came through the front window, Deputy <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahla </PERSON> said. `` They heard a number of shots ring out.

<HEAD>Court to Study University Tenure Issue in University of
Pennsylvania Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a case capturing the attention of some leading universities, agreed today to study a university's attempt to withhold confidential information from a faculty member who says her denial of tenure was due to illegal discrimination. The court said it will hear an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> officials accused of discriminating against a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> woman denied promotion to full professor. But the justices indicated that they will be studying a very narrow issue in the case _ one dealing with which trial court had the authority to hear it. The university's appeal was supported by <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>. Lawyers for the other schools said that forcing universities to reveal confidential statements about those being considered for professorships will inhibit candor by those who evaluate tenure candidates. The case began with a complaint by <PERSON> Rosalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tung </PERSON>, an associate professor of management at <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>, after she was denied tenure at the university's <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Tenure is a lifetime appointment to the faculty. Ms. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> filed a complaint with the federal <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> charging she was the victim of discrimination against women and people of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> race. The commission subpoenaed the university's confidential peer review records for Ms. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> and five other male candidates considered for tenure. The university refused to provide the documents. It said confidentiality is vital to the tenure review process, which in turn is `` a critical component'' of the university's academic freedom protected by the Constitution. University officials supported a balancing test, approved by other federal appeals courts, that would allow the school to keep the information secret unless it is shown to be essential to the claim being made by the teacher denied tenure. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last June that the university must not be allowed to shield possible discrimination behind `` a wall of secrecy.'' The appeals court said relevant information may not be concealed from the commission. But the appeals court ordered further trial court hearings to determine whether the university may be allowed to delete from the peer review reports the names of professors who evaluate tenure candidates. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to allow the appeals court ruling to stand. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers noted that the high court in 1986 declined to review the issue in a similar case. They said there is no more reason now for the court to enter the dispute. The case is <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION>, 88-493.

 Residents of a town southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> got a double surprise when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military helicopter made an emergency landing with <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> aboard. Police said today the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter landed Sunday in a rice paddy about 220 yards from an elementary school after an oil leak was detected in the rotor. One of the four crew members emerged from the helicopter dressed in a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> suit in hopes of surprising his family at nearby <LOCATION> Atsugi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, said the police officer in <LOCATION> Isehara </LOCATION>, 30 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` -LRB- The crew member -RRB- said he boarded the helicopter in uniform and changed while he was aboard,'' said the police official, spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the helicopter was on a routine training flight and no injuries or damage to the craft were reported. He refused to name any of the helicopter crew members.

 Investigators today cleared unexploded fireworks from a marketplace where a chain reaction of blasts and flames killed at least 70 people in stalls crowded with Christmas shoppers. Forty-five people were injured in the explosions Sunday in the congested street market, said <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Padillo </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> commander. Most were quickly released from the hospital and none was reported seriously injured. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzo </PERSON> said early today that 70 bodies had been found. At least 12 of the dead were children, officials said. The last seven bodies were discovered shortly after 3 a.m. -LRB- 4 a.m. EST -RRB- in a storeroom of illegal fireworks. Many of the other dead were found in the rubble of candy vendors' stalls. `` It was a time bomb,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, a member of a union of market vendors. `` There's hundreds of people who come here to sell them -LRB- illegal fireworks -RRB-, they have for years. Why did n't the authorities come?'' Authorities said they had not determined the cause of the disaster, and witnesses disagreed on where the first explosion occurred. But all said that after the first blast, explosions ripped like machine-gun fire through stalls where vendors had been selling skyrockets, Roman candles and other fireworks. `` At first it sounded like bullets. Then there were more and more and then the explosion,'' said <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>, who was working in a shoe store. Selling fireworks to the general public is barred in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, but the law is widely ignored. The fire ripped through the congested market and five adjacent buildings, which are half a mile from the Zocalo Plaza in the heart of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The area was crowded with shoppers buying food, looking for Christmas presents and for fireworks to celebrate the Day of the Virgin of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s patron saint, which is today. `` People were running out of the market and screaming,'' said <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, 25, standing by the pile of debris that had been his stand and stock of calculators and other electronic goods. The block on Corona Street was one of scores in the old downtown where vendors set up tables in the street. It is one of the busiest market areas in this city of 18 million and is most famous for the Mercado de Dulces, or Candy Market, one of the buildings that was partially burned. Many people died when they were trapped in buildings along the street that caught fire. The fire spread to the five-story Candy Market, an apartment building and three other buildings. After the fire was out, firefighters and sanitation workers used dollies to remove dozens of crates of unexploded fireworks from the area, and the work continued under floodlights through the night. The street was strewn with spent firecrackers, charred wood and comic books, twisted metal, tangles of high tension wires and glass from shattered windows. Although illegal, fireworks are easily purchased and are a strong tradition on the Day of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>, one of the country's biggest religious holidays. They are heard sporadically in the city from Dec. 12 through New Year's. `` Here's it's all clandestine,'' said <PERSON> Rutilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayala </PERSON>, a policeman at the scene. `` They sell rockets and hide them under pastas, fruit and whatever else they sell.'' `` It's a case of corruption,'' said <PERSON> Angelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Peredo </PERSON> who lives next to one of the buildings that burned. Residents and market vendors vented their anger at Mayor <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> as he plodded through the water-soaked debris, a yard deep in places. `` Many children died here, Mr. <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON>,'' said one man. The mayor, who took office Dec. 1, promised to look for a solution to the problem. District Attorney <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> <PERSON> Lechuga </PERSON> said fireworks are too much of a tradition to do away with. `` This does not mean there is going to be an attack on Mexican culture,'' he said. `` These things -LRB- fireworks -RRB- are part of Mexican culture.'' <PERSON> Everado </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, a municipal leader, admitted that inspections in the market were not frequent and that there might be 2,000 fireworks vendors in his district. `` There are n't enough resources to inspect and watch here every day and night,'' he said. `` They've always sold fireworks here.''

<HEAD>Clinics Swamped As Abortion Ban Goes Into Effect Monday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Doctors and nurses worked double shifts over the weekend as hundreds of poor women had abortions before a new state ban on Medicaid funding for the procedure took effect today. It will be some time before the effect of the ban can be evaluated, but some clinic operators say the measure, approved by <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> voters in the Nov. 8 election, wo n't decrease the number of poor women having abortions. `` A lot of pro-lifers say this is going to hurt us, but I do n't think it will,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a spokesman for Women's Health Services of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> `` I've had women tell me they've sold crack -LRB- cocaine -RRB- to get the money. ... If they know they want to terminate it, they'll get the money.'' At Womancare clinics, which perform most of the Medicaid-funded abortions in the state, doctors and nurses worked double shifts to perform the operation during the weekend, owner Dr. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodari </PERSON> said. The clinics were prepared to perform 120 abortions Friday and Saturday, about 50 percent more than the normal two-day total, he said. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a woman answering calls at a Womancare office today, was unable to say how many abortions were actually performed. <PERSON> Hodari </PERSON> said with the ban in effect, he would perform abortions for $ 50 for Medicaid recipients. `` During the years I did this on Medicaid, I saved a lot of money,'' he said. `` Now I want to help people with it.'' Proponents of the ban said the state spent $ 6 million on Medicaid abortions last year for about 18,000 poor women. Some forecasts show the state now will have to pay between $ 10 million and $ 50 million because of more Medicaid births and children born into poverty, State Medicaid Director <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> said. In states where Medicaid-funded abortions have ended, such as <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, studies show about 20 percent of Medicaid-eligible women who carried pregnancies to term would probably have had abortions had they been free. The cost to taxpayers for a Medicaid abortion averages $ 318 in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, state Medicaid administrator <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The cost for a Medicaid recipient who delivers a baby averages $ 3,100 for health care and hospitalization. A 19-year-old who had an abortion Friday at the Womancare clinic in <LOCATION> Southfield </LOCATION> said she would have terminated her pregnancy even without Medicaid financing. `` I'd have found the money somewhere,'' said the woman, who identified herself only as <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. `` I do n't know where, though.''

<HEAD>Court Rules on Garbage-Privacy Issue in Nebraska Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, already having ruled that privacy rights do not extend to garbage left at curbside for pick-up, today refused to treat differently garbage discarded closer to home. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that a convicted Fremont, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, man had no privacy right in garbage cans left outside for collection four feet from his home's back door. Unlike the court's decision last May in a case from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, today's order sets no national precedent. But it defeats <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Trahan </PERSON>'s challenge to his conviction for possession of cocaine and gambling records and for promoting gambling. Fremont police and Dodge County Sheriff's deputies, without obtaining a court warrant, searched through the contents of garbage left outside <PERSON> Trahan </PERSON>'s trailer home and outside the tavern he and his roommate owned. They found `` bet sheets'' used by bookmakers. Police previously had been tipped that <PERSON> Trahan </PERSON> was involved in bookmaking. After obtaining a search warrant, law enforcement officers raided <PERSON> Trahan </PERSON>'s home. They found gambling materials and some cocaine inside. <PERSON> Trahan </PERSON> was sentenced to three years probation. The <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld <PERSON> Trahan </PERSON>'s conviction and sentence last Sept. 2, rejecting arguments that the warrantless search of the garbage left for collection on his property violated his privacy rights. The nation's highest court voted 6-2 last May 16 in ruling that police do not need a warrant before sifting through garbage left in plastic bags at curbside. `` It is common knowledge that plastic garbage bags left on or at the side of a public street are readily accessible to animals, children, scavengers, snoops or other members of the public,'' Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> wrote for the court then. `` The police can not reasonably be expected to avert their eyes from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by any member of the public,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> court said <PERSON> Trahan </PERSON>'s challenge must fail in light of the May decision. `` Garbage left for collection at a designated location and accessible to the public shall not be accorded constitutional protection'' whether it is on or off someone's private property, the state court ruled. The case is <PERSON> Trahan </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, 88-697.

<HEAD>Questions Raised About Charitable Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman whose annual Thanksgiving-eve dinners for the elderly have attracted thousands of dollars in donations and praise from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been ordered by the state to halt fund-raising. And The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that a detailed examination raises questions about most aspects of her operation, including her claims to feeding thousands, her record-keeping and fund-raising. <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolds </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> has claimed to feed up to 25,000 people each year. Far fewer than that showed up this year, and while she said her charity was deep in debt, much of the food was donated. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> gave inconsistent and sometimes contradictory answers while defending the charity she heads, <ORGANIZATION> Concerned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, its records and the scope of the operation, the newspaper reported. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> did not return phone messages left by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was unable to say how much <ORGANIZATION> Concerned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has raised or spent in recent years. She has kept no ledger. She has no checking account. She makes most of her purchases with cash, she told the newspaper. `` I'm just terrible with record-keeping and stuff like that,'' she explained, adding that she runs essentially a one-woman operation. <ORGANIZATION> Concerned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has failed to file annual reports required by state law and pay its $ 10 registration fee since 1986, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates charities' fund-raising. In March the commission ordered Concerned Parents to halt fund-raising until it filed updated reports and renewed its registration to operate as a charity. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> told the Inquirer she complied with the letter almost immediately, but commission officials said they have no reply from <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> on file. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 47, says her annual Thanksgiving-eve dinners began modestly in 1968, when she invited elderly neighbors to share Thanksgiving dinner with her family. It has gotten more publicity as it has grown. Publicity helped the charity raise thousands of dollars from hundreds of givers _ <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> has two index-card file boxes filled with their names and addresses. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has written a letter of praise. In interviews, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> always stresses the financial and logistical burden of feeding 25,000 people a dinner that includes turkey, ham, roast beef, macaroni salad, sweet potatoes, collard greens and baked beans. This year, as in the past, she said her menu would include 500 turkeys, 200 hams and 400 `` steamship rounds'' of roast beef. In fact, no turkey was served at the dinner _ although there were 450 chickens. There were only nine canned hams and a dozen rounds of roast beef, according to a check of the kitchen that day at the Civic Center site of the dinner and interviews with <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> cooks who volunteered to prepare the meal. There was still more than enough food because far fewer than 25,000 showed up for the dinner. In an interview the day of the dinner, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said she had raised about $ 23,000 for this year's meal, but was $ 70,000 in debt. She used identical figures in interviews before the 1987 dinner. Much of the food served this year was donated, according to local corporations and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` The money that we have raised has never covered the cost of the meal,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` When we were doing it on our own, we were always in the hole doing it. And we've been in the hole ever since.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> has two criminal convictions: one in 1968 for passing worthless checks; another in 1979 for her part in a scheme to steal $ 158,000 in emergency checks from the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. She insisted that she got into trouble while trying to help others. `` I have never done anything to benefit myself personally. When they investigated it ... they found it was done to help others,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON>, the maverick Soviet-born theater director, has left the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after a dispute over his staging of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s `` The Ring of the Nibelungs.'' <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON>, general director of the opera house in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Covent Garden, said Sunday that the 70-year-old Russian had been released from his contract <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> was leaving after `` intellectual differences in artistic interpretation'' with the Royal Opera's Dutch-born music director, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Haitink </PERSON>. The collaboration could only have proceeded if there was `` absolute confidence between them,'' <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> said. `` The Ring'' is a German myth about power struggles among ancient gods over a hoard of gold, and discord over how to present the work is nothing new in the operatic world. <PERSON> Haitink </PERSON>, who does n't like displays of temperament, clashed with <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> over the director's emotive staging ideas and dislike of detailed advance planning. <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Haitink </PERSON> argued interminably during rehearsals earlier this year over the staging of the first part of the cycle, `` The Rhine Gold.'' The opera opened Sept. 29 to general acclaim from critics and public and every seat was sold for the six performances. But the crunch came over how `` The Valkyrie,'' the second part of the four-opera `` Ring'' cycle, should be presented next year. `` They had very different ideas ... and despite making every effort, no consensus could be reached,'' said an opera house official who asked not to be identified. `` That's not uncommon with ` The Ring,' which is the most demanding work in the whole of opera. There have been many resignations over it in many opera houses in the past,'' the official added. <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> told a reporter: `` I regret this parting of the ways since I admire <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON>'s work very much. But I am sure this decision is for the best.'' <PERSON> Lybimov </PERSON> will be replaced by a German director, <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON>, 58, said <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON>. <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> staged the `` The Ring'' at Covent Garden in 1974-1976. He works for the Deutsche Oper, based in the West German cities of <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Duisburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Haitink </PERSON>, 59, had chosen <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> to produce the cycle over a four-year period. `` The Valkyrie'' is scheduled for September 1989, followed by `` Siegfried'' and `` The Twilight of the Gods'' in the 1990-91 season. <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> scored a hit at the Royal Opera in 1986 with an innovative staging of the Czechoslovak opera `` Jenufa,'' by <PERSON> Leos </PERSON> <PERSON> Janacek </PERSON>. He is to stage <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` Hamlet'' in 1989 in <LOCATION> Leicester </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> made his name at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s avant-garde <LOCATION> Taganka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION>, which he founded. His productions often ran into trouble with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials. In 1983, <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to stage <PERSON> Fyodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Dostoyevsky </PERSON>'s `` Crime and Punishment'' and extended his stay, demanding assurances he would be allowed artistic freedom in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But in 1984 he was fired from his job and expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Four months later, he was stripped of his citizenship. <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> later became an Israeli citizen. In May, he visited <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and was given an ovation when he saw a performance at the Taganka of his play about a rebel Soviet poet and singer. He is to return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in January to direct two plays.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to reinstate a $ 4.5 million libel award won by a former prosecutor against the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>. The justices, citing the lack of `` a properly presented federal question,'' let stand a <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that requires a new trial for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON>'s lawsuit against the newspaper. <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> lawyer in private practice, formerly served as an assistant district attorney in that city. He sued the Inquirer and several of its reporters and editors 15 years ago over two series of articles published in late March and early April of 1973. The first series of articles indicated that <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON> had participated in an illegal wiretapping scheme. The second series reported that <LOCATION> Sprague </LOCATION>, at a time when he headed the district attorney office's homocide division, had prevented the bringing of homicide charges against the son of a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> State Police official. The series implied that <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON>'s treatment of the case was motivated by personal favoritism. At trial, reporter <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> testified that information for one of the articles about the homicide case came from a confidential source. He refused to identify the source when <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON>'s lawyers demanded he do so. The trial judge, noting that <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> was legally entitled to withhold the name under <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s `` shield law,'' told jurors they should not consider any evidence derived from such sources. The state's shield law, similar to those in many states, says no one connected with a news-gathering organization can be forced to disclose confidential sources to any court or government investigation. The jury ruled for <LOCATION> Sprague </LOCATION>, awarding him $ 1.5 million in compensatory damages and $ 3 million in punitive damages. A state appeals court threw out the award and ordered a new trial, and the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld that ruling last May 31. `` The reporter's information is properly admitted and no adverse inference may be drawn from the invocation of the shield law,'' the state court said. It said jurors should be told that invocation of the shield law `` does not establish an affirmative inference either as to the reliability of the source or as to the validity of the information received.'' Plaintiffs and defendants are free to offer evidence or arguments about reliability and validity, the state court said. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> concluded, `` If the shield law is invoked by the defendant to avoid disclosing a source, no inference either favorable or adverse may be drawn ... as to the reliability of the unidentified source or as to the accuracy of the information supplied.'' The case is <LOCATION> Sprague </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, 88-671.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today upheld a voting rights ruling that led to the election of a black <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member from <LOCATION> Crittenden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The court, by an 8-0 vote, ruled against an appeal by Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> officials that had challenged the election of <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> as a state legislator. The case began when blacks in <LOCATION> Crittenden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> filed a voting rights lawsuit attacking the county's at-large system for electing two House members. The suit contended that the system deprived black voters of a chance to elect a black to the House. A special three-judge federal court agreed last April that the system violated the federal Voting Rights Act. The three-judge court threw out the results of a March 8 primary election in which <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, who is black, was defeated by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockley </PERSON>, who is white, for the Democratic nomination. The lower court split the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voting district into two single-member districts, and on Sept. 20 <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> won the nomination. That was tantamount to election on Nov. 8, since no Republican ran for the seat. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> and the other state officials said the federal court improperly threw out the results of the first primary and ordered a new election. But the federal court said the voting rights law was violated, although it did not find intentional discrimination against blacks. The law does not require minority groups to prove intentional discrimination before getting courts to order election changes. The three-judge court noted that there is ample evidence that black voters in <LOCATION> Crittenden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were deprived of a chance to elect one of their own. It said its conclusion is supported by evidence of highly racially polarized voting. One of the new single-member districts created by the lower court has a population of more than 60 percent black. Today's decision, not accompanied by any opinion, upheld the three-judge court ruling. Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, hospitalized last week for treatment of pneumonia, did not participate in the vote. The case is <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 88-554.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal in Death of Marine in Virginia Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a case it previously used to give military contractors sweeping immunity from being sued, today rejected an appeal by a family seeking damages for the death of a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> helicopter co-pilot. The court, without comment, refused to order a new trial in a lawsuit stemming from a 1983 helicopter crash in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. A federal jury in 1985 ordered helicopter manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Sikorsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 725,000 to the family of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, who drowned April 27, 1983, when his CH-53 helicopter crashed <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> and the three other crew members survived the crash impact. The three others escaped through emergency hatches, but <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> was unable to open his hatch against the pressure of the water. His family said the design was defective, arguing the hatch should have opened inward to permit escape. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in May 1986 threw out the jury award against <ORGANIZATION> Sikorsky </ORGANIZATION> and its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in an important 5-4 ruling last June, substantially upheld the appeals court decision. The high court said a military contractor is protected from suit when it makes equipment conforming to `` reasonably precise'' Pentagon specifications and the company warns the government about any potential dangers of which the company is aware. But the justices sent the case back to the 4th Circuit court to determine whether the appeals court improperly acted as a trial court and decided factual issues. The 4th Circuit court said in August it did not usurp the jury's function `` No reasonable jury could have found for -LRB- the <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> family -RRB- on the facts presented,'' the appeals court said. `` It is clear in this case that the military contractor defense was established as a matter of law.'' In its latest appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> family argued there are factual issues that should be submitted to a jury. The family said, for example, there is a question whether the government actually approved Sikorsky's design and whether the government's specifications for the escape hatch were reasonably precise. The case is <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>, 88-677.

 Official estimates put the death toll from the Armenian earthquake at up to 60,000 today, and hopes waned that any more survivors would be found. A second relief plane crashed near the Armenian capital, killing seven people. Renewed political trouble broke out, with Armenian activists reporting clashes with troops over the arrest of several nationalist leaders. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, after touring the disaster area, accused `` provocateurs'' of using the consequences of last week's earthquake to create instability and insisted, `` They must be stopped.'' One Armenian activist who avoided arrest, <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>, said by telephone today that three demonstrations were staged Sunday in the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. He said all were protesting the arrest of leaders of a committee that has spearheaded a drive to annex <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a predominantly Armenian enclave in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. In one demonstration, troops and demonstrators began fighting, and several were wounded on both sides, <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said. An editor at Armenpress, the Armenian news agency, confirmed there was violence at one demonstration but said the incident did not appear serious. The editor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, acknowledged soldiers fired several warning shots to break up the protest. He confirmed that police detained several leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday. A dozen tanks were parked in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s central square Sunday night. Before dawn today, a <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> military plane crashed while trying to land at <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> airport with medical supplies _ the second crash of a relief plane in as many days. On Sunday, a Soviet military transport plane crashed as it approached the airport at <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, a city hard hit by Wednesday's quake. Seventy-eight people died. All seven crew members aboard the AN-12 cargo plane died in today's crash, First Deputy Aviation Minister <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Banyukov </PERSON> said. Local reporters said the plane crashed at 4 a.m. because the pilot mistook a well-lit highway for a runway. The Yugoslav plane was part of an international relief effort. Council of Ministers spokesman <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Voznesensky </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that 38 relief planes have arrived from abroad, with the most _ six _ from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. He and other officials said 923 specialists from abroad with 216 search dogs were working in the disaster area. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> there was little hope more survivors would be found in the rubble piled high in several Armenian cities, including <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, near the quake's epicenter, and <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, which was virtually wiped out. The spokesman, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, said only people trapped who managed to find water and had an air supply would survive. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> quoted reports that only 150 people survived in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, where some 25,000 people lived before the quake. Other reports said only 10 percent of the population remained. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter visiting <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> found a nearly deserted wasteland. She said only a few hundred residents remained. Bitter cold weather was forecast for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> overnight, worsening conditions for the 500,000 people left homeless by the quake. The Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said the temperature in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> would drop to 14 to 23 degrees Fahrenheit. The center did not have weather information for the disaster area itself, but temperatures there have generally been even lower. Hundreds of bonfires provided the only heat for some people who have lived on the streets since the quake. The earthquake rescue effort, drawing workers and supplies from about 40 nations, has been hampered by shortages of equipment and haphazard organization, some officials said. Some aid that proved useless. A crane sat idle besides the ruins in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>. Workers said it was too small. Without electricity or water, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> rescuers worked around the clock by the eerie light of campfires. On Sunday, with the aid of search dogs, they pulled out of the rubble a man in his 30s who had broken bones in his legs but did not appear seriously injured. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and international rescue workers warned of the danger of epidemics breaking out. But one relief official from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sverre </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilde </PERSON>, said the danger was substantially reduced by sub-freezing temperatures in most of the region, which would inhibit the growth of disease-carrying organisms. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wound up a two-day visit to the disaster area Sunday and called the earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, `` a grave disaster, simply a tragedy.'' Doctors Without Borders, an international relief organization, said in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> that Health Minister <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON> told workers the quake had claimed 50,000 to 60,000 lives. The previous government estimate was 40,000 to 45,000. The Soviet Embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said about 500,000 were left homeless and 6,000 people were hospitalized. It said 1,500 people had been rescued. Mayor <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirokofyan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> told a group of foreign correspondents that recently constructed apartment buildings were not built to withstand such a severe temblor _ even though <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> is in an area of frequent earthquakes. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> promised residents of the disaster zone that the government would begin an investigation of why new apartment buildings crumbled so easily while older buildings remained standing after the quake. Officials and rescuers pleaded for more cranes and heavy equipment to drag slabs of concrete and twisted pillars off trapped people. At one site, rescuers worked feverishly with saws, torches, hammers and crowbars to free a family of seven discovered near the top of what was a nine-story apartment building. The earthquake aggravated an already severe refugee problem in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, where thousands of ethnic Armenians fled because of anti-Armenian rioting in the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court Asks Administration Viet of Fine Against Maryland Paper Mill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today asked the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for its view of a fine of nearly $ 1 million against a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> paper mill operator for failing to comply with a federal clean water law's reporting requirements. The court said it wants to hear from <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers before acting on a challenge to a key provision of the act authorizing citizens and environmental groups to sue alleged polluters. The court is not expected to say whether it will grant full review to the case before hearing from the administration, which could take months. <ORGANIZATION> Simkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> runs a paper mill in <LOCATION> Catonsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, on the banks of the <LOCATION> Patapsco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> sued the company for failing to monitor and file quarterly reports on discharges into the river from Aug. 1, 1981, to March 31, 1984. Under the federal Clean Water Act, the company's permit to operate the mill required it to monitor discharges and report them. <PERSON> Simkins </PERSON> faced fines of up to $ 10,000 a day, or a total of $ 9.77 million. A federal judge assessed penalties of one-tenth that amount, $ 977,000, payable to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. There was testimony that the company's plant supervisor did not regard sampling of its discharges as a priority. The <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with members nationwide, charged that <PERSON> Simkins </PERSON> had discharged copper into the Patapso at 10,000 times the safe levels for fresh water, and that oil and grease in the river from the mill were twice the allowable limit. The company said the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> did not have the legal authority to sue it because the club suffered no direct injury, and also that the suit should be dismissed because it was filed after <PERSON> Simkins </PERSON> stopped violating the law's reporting requirements. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last May upheld the fine. The appeals court said the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> established that at least one of its members who uses the <LOCATION> Patapsco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for recreation was injured by <PERSON> Simkins </PERSON>' violations. Fines for failure to monitor and report possible pollution `` can be an important deterrence against future violations,'' the appeals court added. The appeals court, citing a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision, said such private citizen suits under the clean water law may not be `` based upon wholly past violations.'' The appeals court added that <PERSON> Simkins </PERSON> was violating the law at the time the suit was filed in late 1984. The company did not file a complete quarterly report until January 1985, nearly three months after the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> filed suit. `` It is true that <PERSON> Simkins </PERSON>' failure to sample occurred solely before <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> filed suit,'' the appeals court said. `` But <PERSON> Simkins </PERSON>' monitoring obgligations were not designed to be a mere academic exercise.'' `` Unless a permit holder monitors as required, it will be difficult if not impossible for state and federal officials ... to know whether or not the permit holder is discharging effluents in excess of the permit's maximum levels.'' The appeals court also noted that <PERSON> Simkins </PERSON> began monitoring its discharges after it was alerted by the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> that it was about to be sued. The case is <PERSON> Simkins </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, 88-660.

<TEXT>
 Justice Minister <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> announced today she is resigning because of controversy over a telephone call in which she advised her husband to break with a company accused in a drug money laundering scandal. The 52-year-old <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>, first woman to join the federal executive, only last Wednesday was elected vice president, a post that rotates annually and would have made her eligible to become president in 1990. She announced she will step down as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> by the end of February because she has come under `` unbearable pressure.'' `` I am not morally and legally guilty of any wrongdoing,'' she said in a statement, adding that a brief Oct. 27 telephone conversation with her husband had gained `` disproportionate importance.'' In the telephone call, she disclosed Friday, she warned her husband, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>, to give up his seat on the board of the Lebanese-controlled Zurich-based Shakarchi Trading A.G.. A few days later, prosecutors announced they had opened an inquiry into a $ 1-billion money laundering operation and accused <PERSON> Shakarchi </PERSON> of involvement The company denies the charge. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>, who resigned from the board a week before news of the inquiry broke, said he did so for personal reasons and that he had no knowledge of any illegal activities by the company. Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> said she warned her husband after her personal assistant told her privately of the suspicions about <PERSON> Shakarchi </PERSON>. She maintained she had no official information and did not violate the trust of her office. A public opinion poll three months ago named her the most popular Cabinet member. But her revelation caused an uproar believed without precedent in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Even members of her own conservative <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> urged Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> to step down. A government spokesman said President <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Stich </PERSON> thanked Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> for her work and said she continued to command the confidence of her Cabinet colleagues.

<HEAD>Court Avoids Decision on Pennsylvania Age-Bias Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, avoiding a decision on an important issue for all lawsuits alleging age bias in employment, today dismissed the case of a laid-off <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> man. By an 8-1 vote, the justices said in effect that they had made a mistake when agreeing to decide whether <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brieck </PERSON>'s lawsuit against his former employer, <ORGANIZATION> Harbison-Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refractories </ORGANIZATION>, should proceed to trial. The court's action was carried in a one-sentence, unsigned decision dismissing the case as `` improvidently granted.'' Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> dissented. The effect is to leave intact an appeals court victory for <PERSON> Brieck </PERSON> that clears the way for further trial court proceedings in his case. <PERSON> Harbison-Walker </PERSON>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Dresser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, sells specialized ceramic brick products primarily to steel producers. <PERSON> Brieck </PERSON> worked as an installation specialist for <PERSON> Harbison-Walker </PERSON> from 1965 to 1982. In July 1982, several employees of <PERSON> Harbison-Walker </PERSON>'s Iron and Steel Marketing Support Group were laid off, including <PERSON> Brieck </PERSON>. He then was 55. <PERSON> Brieck </PERSON> sued in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> in 1984, contending that he was laid off and not recalled to work because of his age. His lawsuit pointed to a 39-year-old installation specialist with less seniority who was not laid off until November 1982 and then recalled eight months later. Lawyers for <PERSON> Harbison-Walker </PERSON> contended that the other employee, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Faust </PERSON>, was retained because of his more diverse work experience. A federal judge threw out <PERSON> Brieck </PERSON>'s suit, ruling that <PERSON> Harbison-Walker </PERSON> had articulated legitimate, non-discriminatory business reasons for laying off <LOCATION> Brieck </LOCATION> while retaining a younger man with less seniority. But the 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reinstated the suit last year. The appeals court ruled that an employer charged with violating the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act can not avoid trial by articulating legitimate business reasons if the suing employee presents `` a reasonable inference that the employer's proffered explanation ... is unworthy of credence.'' The appeals court added: `` The question is not whether the employer's asserted reason is plausible, but whether there is also evidence of record which, if credited, could render the reason implausible.'' Lawyers for <PERSON> Harbison-Walker </PERSON> had argued in a session before the justices Oct. 31 that the appeals court ruling would virtually eliminate pretrial dismissals in employment discrimination cases. The case is <PERSON> Harbison-Walker </PERSON> vs. Brieck, 87-271.

 A frigid air mass spread from the Great Lakes to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the South today, plunging temperatures to record lows and forcing homeless people to shelters. One man apparently froze to death on a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> street, and a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> woman warming her heatless home with candles died in a fire. Accidents on snowy roads were blamed for at least 10 deaths in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. More than a foot of snow was responsible for hundreds of weekend traffic accidents in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, authorities said. Wind-whipped snow caused hazardous driving conditions through much of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. Snow was falling this morning over parts of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Snow was forecast for <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, a snow advisory was in effect for eastern <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, and wintry weather was possible in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> beginning tonight. The cold air mass was so far-reaching that it produced predictions of snow over <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> today, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. The bitter temperatures forced hundreds of homeless off the streets in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and into shelters, agencies reported. `` We've filled every bed we have. It usually gets worse when the weather gets colder _ people who normally might not come here show up because they just ca n't bear the cold,'' said <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, assistant supervisor of the 113-bed <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, police took only four homeless people to shelters overnight. Three came in voluntarily, and a cold weather alert gave police the authority to remove the fourth from the streets against her will, said a department spokesman, Sgt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. One homeless <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> man did n't make it to a shelter. The man was found Sunday on a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> street, apparently frozen to death, police said. The man's identity was not known.

A van operated by the shelter to bring in street people `` brought in quite a few. They're very busy tonight.''

 Incumbent <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> easily won a five-year term as <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s president today and Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> scored a victory in her first parliamentary vote of confidence. Federal Election Commissioner <PERSON> S.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusrat </PERSON> said on television that <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> swept 78 percent of the presidential vote. Of 446 valid votes, <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> polled 348 compared with 91 to his nearest rival, veteran politican <PERSON> Nawabzada </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nusrat </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> won her first test of strength in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the country's lower house of parliament. Of 203 members voting on the confidence motion, 148 said `` yes'' and 55 said `` no.'' Her <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> party emerged as the largest single party Nov. 16 in the country's first free elections in more than a decade. But with 105 seats, it fell short of an outright majority in the 237-seat legislature. The party since gained support from several independents and minor parties. The constitution dictates that the governing party pass a parliamentary test of confidence within 60 days of forming a government. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and four provincial assemblies functioned as an electoral college for the president. Provincial assemblies were restricted to 45 votes each to put them on equal footing. The populous eastern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> assembly has 260 members, for example, compared to western <LOCATION> Baluchistan </LOCATION>'s 45 legislators. Of the four presidential candidates, only <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, 73, of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, had the support both of Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s party and the right-wing opposition alliance, headed by the <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> has been credited with guiding <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> back to democracy after 11 years of autocratic rule, eight of them under martial law by President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> died in an Aug. 17 plane crash investigators said was probably caused by sabotage. Because he was <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chairman, the presidency was passed to <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, a venerable technocrat and constitutional scholar with nearly 40 years' experience in senior administrative posts, six of them as finance and commerce minister. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s president holds a largely ceremonial post, but the roles of both president and prime minister are under debate here. A 1985 constitutional amendment authored by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> gave the president broad but vague discretionary powers. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> has called for a repeal of that amendment, which would restore supreme political powers to the prime minister as they existed during her father's government of the 1970s. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ousted Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, in 1977. He had <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> executed two years later allegedly for plotting to overthrow a political foe.

<HEAD>Court Bars Government From Retroactively Applying Hospital Medicare
Payment Rules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a ruling likely to mean millions of additonal dollars for some hospitals, today barred the government from retroactively applying rules limiting reimbursement paid to hospitals treating Medicare patients. By a 9-0 vote, the court rejected <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration arguments that some hospitals could reap a windfall from a ban on retroactive application of the government's reimbursement formula. The justices upheld a ruling that awarded more than $ 2 million to seven hospitals. The administration said more money could be at stake. The government in 1981 adopted a rule that excluded from the Medicare reimbursement formula for private hospitals the wages paid by hospitals owned by the federal government. The idea was to save money by not applying national pay scales to private hospitals in areas with lower wage levels. But the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> adopted the new rule without allowing a time for the public to comment on the proposal. The formula was challenged by private hospitals and thrown out by a federal judge as a violation of proper rule-making procedures. The federal agency adopted the rule again in 1984 using the correct procedure. But this time the department applied the rule retroactively to reimbursement sought by the hospitals beginning July 1, 1981. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today upheld a ruling by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here that the formula may not be applied retroactively. `` Our interpretation of the Medicare Act compels the conclusion that the secretary -LRB- of HHS -RRB- has no authority to promulgate retroactive cost-limit rules,'' said Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> for the court. The hospitals involved in the case are <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> here; <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> -RRB- General, Greater Southeast Community, <ORGANIZATION> Tucson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, St. Cloud -LRB- <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> -RRB- Hospital and <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>.

 Two air force planes loaded with supplies and medical teams left for a city in earthquake-stricken <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> today but returned after an Israeli general there said their help would be more useful elsewhere, officials said. Officials said Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vardi </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, radioed the pilots that no additional medical assistance was needed in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>'s second-largest city which has been devastated by the quake. The U.S.-made Hercules transports had been sent to reinforce Israeli experts who went to <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> on Sunday. A military spokesman said <PERSON> Vardi </PERSON> ordered the planes to return because he decided `` they could not be used effectively at the scene'' and would be more useful elsewhere, the spokesman said. He said the planes were not turned back by the Soviet government. The Israeli participation in the rescue effort was seen as part of a warming trend between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which have not had diplomatic relations since the Soviets cut ties after the 1967 Middle East War. On board the aircraft that left today were 46 doctors, medics, vehicles, an electric generator, field hospital, blood and medicine, the military said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> began sending aid to the Armenians on Sunday with a planeload of supplies including cranes, medicines and a specially trained rescue dog. As the planes took off today, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s top diplomat in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> said this assistance would bring Israelis and Soviets closer. `` We are greatly moved by this,'' <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martirosov </PERSON>, who heads the Soviet consular delegation in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio. `` This help by the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> people will bring us closer emotionally.'' The earthquake relief was the second time <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has given humanitarian aid to the Soviets this month and some officials have said they hoped the Jewish state would reap diplomatic benefits. On Dec. 2, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> allowed a hijacked Soviet jet to land at <LOCATION> Ben-Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and subsequently granted a Soviet request by deporting the four hijackers. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> thanked <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for that help in an unprecedented meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with Israeli consular representative, <PERSON> Aryeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. Concerning the aid to Soviet <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Allon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said Sunday, `` we have no intention of building political achievements on such tragic events. I must state, though, that the atmosphere created following this and the hijack incident last week, is a warm and friendly one.''

<HEAD>Deposition Reveals Roy Williams' Impressions of Mob</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The late Teamsters leader <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> once warned his protege <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> to go along with mob associates who had infiltrated the union, according to a court deposition obtained by a newspaper. `` They've infiltrated every big local, every conference, every pension fund, and they're even into the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> in 1958. `` They're bad and I certainly think you should go along with them. I'm tied as tight as I can be.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' recollection of that conversation with <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> was part of a federal court deposition, according to a story in Sunday's editions of The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> During two days last week, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> described his rise and fall in the union, his relationship with the late <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> crime boss <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Civella </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> and several of their Teamster and mob associates. The deposition will be used at the trial of a civil lawsuit brought by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> aimed at removing Teamsters officials and mobsters who allegedly have corrupted the union. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> also said he had agreed to cooperate with the government after he was sentenced to 10 years on the attempted bribery charge. He said his release from prison in September after serving about three years was contingent upon his continued cooperation with the authorities. He gave the deposition on the advice of his attorneys. Most of the questions asked by <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastro </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney from the Southern District of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and other attorneys participating in the deposition focused on <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' association with <PERSON> Civella </PERSON> and other organized crime leaders. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> in 1938 and later, as a protege of <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>, rose through the ranks as president of Local 41 in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and finally became international president in 1981. <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> disappeared in 1975 and has been presumed slain. <PERSON> Civella </PERSON> once told <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> that `` <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was his territory and that he had a working relation with other areas including <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>.'' He said he agreed with <PERSON> Civella </PERSON>'s request to find work for some of <PERSON> Civella </PERSON>'s associates. He appointed <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiavola </PERSON>, <PERSON> Civella </PERSON>'s nephew, as a <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> health and safety director, and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ancona </PERSON> as a general organizer Both have been subjects of investigations by police and federal agents. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he met with <PERSON> Civella </PERSON> about once a month. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told the Star on Saturday, through one of his attorneys, that he has not been threatened because of his testimony and that he does not fear for his safety because of his disclosures.

 One moment <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> was heading toward <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> aboard a commuter train, and the next he was scrambling through a rail car roof that had `` split open like a ripe tomato. `` We were sitting next to the aisle in the buffet and when the crash happened we were thrown down the train,'' <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> said today as he awaited treatment for a head injury at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` All I can remember is dust and debris as you've never experienced it in your life.'' <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION>, was among more than 100 people injured when a British Rail commuter train slammed into a stopped train at <LOCATION> Clapham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> during this morning's rush hour and then a freight train on an adjoining track rammed into the wreckage. Dozens were killed. `` There was furniture and enormous lumps of metal flying everywhere,'' <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> said. `` You see pictures of things like this but when you're in the middle of it, your life goes in front of your eyes. `` The whole of the buffet car disintegrated,'' <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> said. `` The roof split open like a ripe tomato and that's how we got out. We tried to find people underneath the rubble but there was so much debris, there was nothing we could do. `` I think the woman who was in there was dead _ and there was a man lying dead on the tracks we we got out,'' <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Underhill </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Farnborough </LOCATION>, said there was `` a hell of a bang'' as his train approached <PERSON> Clapham </PERSON>. `` The train seemed to shoot backwards and the guy opposite me flew into my face,'' said <PERSON> Underhill </PERSON>, who also was taken to St. <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s. `` Amazingly enough, there was not a lot of panic. It was fairly calm and people were helping one another to get out. I saw one man helped out who had lost his foot and there were many others with terrible injuries.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mintram </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Bournemouth </LOCATION>, received 20 stitches at the scene for a head wound. `` It seemed to me, the coach I was on, half -LRB- the people -RRB- were OK and half were bad news,'' he said. He said the woman sitting next to him was killed. `` There was no panic. None whatsoever, no screaming,'' <PERSON> Mintram </PERSON> said. `` We were out in 30 seconds. We climbed out through the roof. There were no seats left. It was a rubbish heap.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Crump </PERSON>, 40, from King's Somborne, was in the back car of the train that hit the stopped commuter train. `` Surprisingly there was no panic whatsoever. I suppose we were in the most fortunate part of the train. We had heard the bang and a terrible screeching sound,'' <PERSON> Crump </PERSON> said at the crash scene. <PERSON> Alun </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, an ambulance worker, was in the same train. `` There was a school on the other side of the track and the people there started taking in the injured. They reacted remarkably quickly and efficiently,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. `` There was a doctor on the train and we both rendered first aid where we could.'' <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Larner </PERSON>, 36, from <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION>, said he saw people with metal in their bodies. `` A woman was trapped with metal which was in her chest and we just started to get people out immediately,'' he said. `` It was the most horrible sight I have ever seen.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sees no need to immediately reciprocate for Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announcement of a military force cutback in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, a White House spokesman said today. `` The president's view of this was that it was a unilateral decision on the part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` We certainly point out the unilateral nature of it as a way of saying there is no response required.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s remarks came amid assertions by other government officials and private analysts that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s vow to cut the size of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> could put new pressure on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to withdraw troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But these same officials and analysts said such a move would do nothing to reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal deficit. At his daily <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news briefing, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman was asked whether it was fair to say that there would be no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announcement last week of a 500,000-troop reduction in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ground forces along with cuts in military armaments. `` It would be appropriate to say it was a unilateral decision that did not require a unilateral reciprocal action and that no reciprocal action is expected,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied. Several officials interviewed about the impact of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s initiative said that unless President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is prepared to reduce the overall size of the American military, simply bringing home <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers to match a Soviet withdrawal of troops from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> front lines would n't save money and might even cost more `` It's debatable whether you get any cost savings, and if you do they're minimal,'' says Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't even have the facilities here to accommodate them.'' If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decides not only to withdraw troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but also to dismiss them from the military, the budget savings could be substantial. Pentagon officials and top brass, however, will resist such a move. The service was forced to cut its strength by 8,600 soldiers in budget cuts last year and is now fielding its smallest active-duty force since before the Korean War in 1950 _ about 772,000. `` Further reductions would increase the risk to the nation's security,'' a new Army briefing paper warns Outgoing Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, in several recent speeches, has made it clear he will not include any further `` force structure'' cuts in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's final budget proposal, which goes to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in January. He has publicly urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to endorse that budget proposal and fight <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a 2 percent real increase in <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> further has sought to remind the American public there are important concerns besides money that guide the stationing of troops overseas. To be simplistic, he says it is far better for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to engage the enemy on foreign soil than on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> territory. `` It is a strategy that requires a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence beyond our shores _ not from habit, not as a gift _ but rather for the defense of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosperity,'' he said in a speech last May. `` Bringing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops home from abroad would not save money unless we deactivate them.'' `` There are some expenses you incur by posting troops overseas that you do n't face here, including swings in the valuation of the dollar, higher travel costs, etc.,'' said one top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> financial officer who asked not to be identified. `` But that's small potatoes compared to the fact that we do n't have the housing or facilities at our bases to accommodate these guys The refurbishing and construction would be a huge expense.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has about 318,000 servicemen assigned to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, of whom about 212,000 are Army troops. Another 200,000 are deployed to other countries around the world or at sea on <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships, meaning roughly 25 percent of the American active-duty force of 2.1 million is deployed outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> audience last week that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will unilaterally reduce its own military of more than 5.1 million by 500,000 troops and pull back 50,000 assigned to the front lines facing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. Retired Rear Adm. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRocque </PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> and a frequent critic of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies, argues that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could easily remove 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> without jeopardizing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> security. `` I'm concerned that if we do n't respond in some way, the Soviets' initiative will be of no avail to reducing forces in the long run,'' he says. `` There's nothing magic about the number of troops we have there now. Pulling troops back to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> does n't do anything for your budget this year, but if conditions improve then we can gradually shrink our forces.'' Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, counters that the cuts announced by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would still leave the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact with a strong numerical advantage in conventional forces. Alliance leaders should be `` first, watchful, and second, wary'' of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s moves, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said last week. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blechman </PERSON>, a former government arms control executive and now a defense consultant, maintains that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could save $ 15 billion if half of its troops and 10 bomber squadrons were deactivated. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should use the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> initiative as a starting point for negotiating mutual, 50 percent troop reductions, he says, adding: `` This military competition is out of sync with today's politics and economics.''

 Rebels say they shot down a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> locust-spraying plane in the belief it was a <LOCATION> Moroccan </LOCATION> military transport and apologized for the attack, which killed the plane's five <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> crewmen The Polisario rebel movement said Sunday it would retrieve the five bodies from the desert and return them to their families in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It made no mention of compensation, and it was n't known how long the recovery would take The DC-7 was shot down Thursday in one of the most desolate parts of the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. There is no regular human settlement for more than 50 miles in any direction, and nothing grows in the wilderness of rock and sand. A second DC-7 was also hit but managed to make it to an airfield 400 miles away and made an emergency landing with its five crew members safe. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the downing of the plane `` once again underscores the need to seek a peaceful end to this long-running conflict.'' Asked if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government accepted the explanation offered by the Polisario, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We do n't have any reason to believe otherwise.'' The statement issued by the Marxist-led Polisario group said the attack, in the no man's land between <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s defensive wall and the Mauritanian border, was `` neither premeditated nor intentional.'' It expressed `` deep sorrow.'' The statement, telexed from Polisario headquarters in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and distributed locally, said the planes were mistaken for Moroccan military C-130s. It said Polisario would return the five bodies to their families without delay. It ascribed the incident to the spirit of Polisario's desert patrols, who it said were `` daily attacked by Moroccan aircraft.'' There was no immediate reaction to the statement from <LOCATION> Moroccan </LOCATION> authorities. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> has insisted that the incident happened over Mauritanian territory. Following vigorous Mauritanian denials, however, a Moroccan government statement late Saturday acknowledged the planes were attacked over the 40-mile-wide no man's land between the defense wall and the border. The planes were chartered by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and were flying from <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, to <ORGANIZATION> Agadir </ORGANIZATION> to take part in the campaign against the growing plague of locusts along the fringes of the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>. Polisario has been fighting Moroccan forces for control of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> since the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> army withdrew from the former <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> colony in 1975. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is trying to organize a referendum among 80,000 inhabitants, but <PERSON> Polisario </PERSON> insists on a prior withdrawal of Moroccan troops and administrators. The two sides also disagree about who should be allowed to vote.

 The nation's oldest synagogue celebrated its 225th anniversary by expressing gratitude for the religious freedom it has enjoyed. `` We have been a symbol -LRB- of religious tolerance -RRB- for both the Jewish world and the gentile community,'' Rabbi <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said Sunday. Almost 300 people of differing faiths crammed into the Touro Synagogue for a traditional Friday night Sabbath service that was seasoned with references to the holiday of Hanukkah. Hanukkah, which means dedication, commemorates the cleansing and resanctification of the Temple in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Maccabees </ORGANIZATION> following their victory over the pagan Greco-Syrians in 165 B.C. The Maccabees' struggle, said temple President <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusinitz </PERSON>, is `` the first recorded battle for religious freedom in history.'' This year, he also noted, the dedication celebrated by the holiday parallels the rededication of the landmark synagogue. Participants in the Sabbath service and various parties this weekend felt `` a combination of pride and at the same time a certain gratitude to the Jewish and gentile communities that welcomed us,'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said. In 1759, 100 years after the first Jewish families sailed into <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, the community decided to build a synagogue. The congregants, who by this time numbered 35 families, hired architect <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>. It is assumed that <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, a Quaker who had never seen a synagogue, based his design on <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Touro </PERSON>'s description of his childhood synagogue in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Touro </PERSON> was the temple's cantor. `` There are enough similarities between the two that we feel they have to be related,'' <PERSON> Kusinitz </PERSON> said. The brick building, which stands 95 percent intact, `` is a mixture of Colonial architecture with traditional Jewish motifs,'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said. `` As simple as it is on the outside, it is as beautiful on the inside,'' <PERSON> Kusinitz </PERSON> said. In 1790, two years before the enactment of the Bill of Rights, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> issued a letter from the synagogue promising the new government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would give `` to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.''

<HEAD>People From Six States Gather at Arson-Plagued Church</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GODFREY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Beside the graves of former slaves and the work of a modern arsonist, people from six states proclaimed that the burned <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AME </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fork </ORGANIZATION> would once again serve its tiny congregation. Frequently vandalized through the years, the church was rebuilt after it was destroyed by arson in April, only to be torched again in October. A suspect in the second fire is awaiting trial. `` It's like when you lose a loved one,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennet </PERSON> of the 200 people who attended the gathering Saturday in this southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> town about 25 miles north of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` People come and you did n't even know they cared.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who lives in nearby <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> and is not a member of the congregation, said he attended out of respect for those who lost their church. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> heard about the rally while attending a stamp collecting convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He stopped by on his way home and wrote a check for $ 300. <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> urged others in the audience not to become bitter about the fires. `` It takes only one or two individuals to upset the progress,'' he said. Last year, racial epithets were carved into the walls of the church, which serves a predominantly black congregation, and swastikas were spray-painted on the building. `` People feel that after the civil rights movement of the'60s that racism died. It did n't. But if we work together, we can kill it,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, pastor of the 25-member congregation, estimated that Saturday's donations would amount to $ 10,000 to $ 12,000. Rebuilding the church is expected to cost about $ 65,000. The church in this town of 2,600 residents was founded in 1863. Its yard is adorned with headstones, both recent and decades old. In some cases only jagged hunks of rock mark the graves. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said many of the former slaves who founded the church are buried there. Authorities said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON>, 19, of <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> confessed to setting the October fire and is awaiting trial on one count of arson. He has not been linked to the earlier blaze. <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON>, who is white, said he was not motivated by racism but by rumors from friends that the building was used by devil worshipers.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is keeping a line open to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> to see what further assistance the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might provide to earthquake victims, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today. A day after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, paid their respects at the embassy here, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there have been so many offers of help that the switchboard at the mission has been jammed. For this reason, he said: `` We have lines open on a continuing basis to receive their needs and find out what they're looking for. They're trying to define better the need at this point.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has spent roughly $ 825,000 to ferry experts and supplies to the ravaged region in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. He said that one <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> C-141 cargo plane had arrived there and that a second was en route. The spokesman estimated that a total of about $ 2.47 million had been raised through the weekend, through private means, to aid the earthquake victims. An additional $ 3 million was raised during a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> telethon Sunday. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also estimated that roughly $ 22.9 million has been collected through international means for assistance to the earthquake region. `` The process at the moment is to continue what we have been doing,'' he said, which for the most part involves helping to see to it that donated food, medicine and other supplies get to the stricken region.

 Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will be replaced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by conservative Republican Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, a former aide recently elected to a fifth term as an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> congressman, a party source said today. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> would make a formal announcement of the appointment later in the day. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s other senator, Republican <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, also were scheduled to make a statement on the subject this afternoon, according to a <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spokesman who declined to divulge any other information. Coats, 45, was elected in 1980 to fill the 4th Congressional District seat <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> vacated to run for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He worked in <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s congressional office in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, from 1976 to 1980, and was known to have <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s backing in the jockeying to pick a new senator for <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Coats has compiled a staunchly conservative record. His rating for 1986 from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> was 82 percent. His rating the same year from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action was 10 percent. He is a supporter of aid to the Nicaraguan Contras and to the Angolan rebels. In 1984, he attempted to attach an amendment to an omnibus education bill that would have cut off federal aid to schools and states banning voluntary school prayer. The amendment was defeated. Calls to Coats' office were unreturned today. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> brushed aside questions as he attended a Christmas-tree trimming ceremony in the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, instead telling reporters to talk to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>. Coats will serve as an appointed senator until a special election is held in 1990 for the remaining two years of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s term. An election for a full six-year <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> term will be held in 1992. Coats' selection also means a special election will be held to fill his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat, probably in March. His selection will leave the total of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans in the incoming, 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at 45. The Democrats will be in the majority with 55 seats. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has announced his intention to resign from his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat by Jan. 2. That would permit Coats to be sworn in a day ahead of the senators elected in November, thus gaining an advantage over the rest of the class in seniority. Party sources said that in selecting Coats, <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> was hoping to find a politician capable of building a strong political and financial base to withstand a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> challenge for his seat in either 1990 or 1992. Several other names had been mentioned as potential candidates for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s seat, including former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> political director <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, who is a political protege of <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> took himself out of contention several weeks ago, as did <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, wife of the vice president-elect. Others who had meen mentioned as contenders included Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudnut </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> and Lt. Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutz </PERSON>, who was defeated last month in a bid for the governor's office. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> was moving to fill the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vacancy before his own term ends early next month, to prevent <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s incoming <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor, <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, from naming a Democrat to the post.

 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> has made a career of following <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> _ first as his aide, later as a congressman and now as the vice president-elect's apparent successor in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` We call them the two Dans because <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> worked for him and followed him to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, the 4th District Republican chairman. Coats, 45, was expected to be formally named by Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> this afternoon to fill <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat for the next two years, according to a source in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Coats' rise to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> marks the second time in his career he has filled a vacancy left by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. In 1980, Coats, then <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s district representative, won his first term in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House in the same year his boss won the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat Although their careers have followed similar paths, the two men are different in background and style, friends say. Coats was born in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and then served in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. He received his law degree by attending night classes at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a native Hoosier, also attended the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> law school while serving in the National Guard during the Vietnam War. Four years older than <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, Coats joined <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s staff in 1976 after working as an assistant vice president and legal counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In contrast to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, an exuberant campaigner, Coats is `` very low-key,'' said former Secretary of State <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simcox </PERSON>, who went to law school with Coats. <PERSON> Simcox </PERSON>, who had been in the running for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s seat, said of Coats: `` I think a great deal of him. He's an outstanding person.'' Gates called Coats, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> resident, especially attentive to his constituents' wishes. `` He's not ultra-conservative. He really studies what the people want and votes that way. He takes a lot of surveys,'' said <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>. `` He really cares for his people.'' That attentiveness has translated into significant vote-getting appeal, the party official noted. In fact, Coats has never received less than 61 percent of the vote in the northeastern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> district. On Nov. 8, he won 62 percent of the vote in defeating <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a Democrat who lost to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in the 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race.

 Three trains collided in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at the height of this morning's rush hour, killing dozens of people and injuring more than 100 in a vast tangle of crushed metal. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> divisional officer, said nine hours after the crash that all the bodies were thought to have been recovered, and the death count stood at 35. Police Detective Inspector <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said another person died in a hospital, bringing the toll to 36. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> told reporters the death toll had fluctuated during the day because some bodies were dismembered. A <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambulance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, who requested anonymity, said 115 passengers were hospitalized, 30 with serious injuries. Others were treated where they lay on the ground or in the wreckage, and some people had to have limbs amputated to extricate them. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, the Fire Brigade's chief divisional officer, said all survivors had been removed about five hours after the crash near busy Clapham Junction just before 8 a.m. But he said he feared that when the mangled wreckage was finally cleared `` there may be further bodies underneath.'' <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> also did not rule out a further increase in the death toll. Rescue workers used metal cutters to pry open rail cars strewn like matchwood across the tracks. Scores of people suffered minor injuries and were treated on the scene. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, a law enforcement unit controlled by state-owned <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>, said at the scene that about 1,500 people were aboard the 20 passenger carriages involved in the crash. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> came out of a meeting in her Cabinet room and told reporters she was `` grief-stricken.'' `` It brings home to us very much that families have lost some of their dearest people ... it is even more poignant just coming up to Christmas,'' she said. Transport Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>, facing opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> charges of overcrowding trains and cutting safety expenditures, promised the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> an independent public inquiry would be set up. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> said a crowded passenger train traveling at 40 mph to 50 mph slammed into the back of a stationary commuter train about a quarter-mile south of <LOCATION> Clapham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION>. An empty freight train traveling on an adjoining track in the opposite direction then crashed into the spillover wreckage, he said. `` We were going pretty fast, about 70 miles an hour,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, 28, who was on the passenger train. `` It went ` bang' and that was it. We were all over the place.'' <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, 37, was in the buffet car when `` the train started stopping and we started falling on top of each other. We came to a stop and the -LRB- buffet -RRB- counter was sort of lodged on top of us. That saved us.'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION>, also was in the buffet car. He said he saw `` furniture and enormous lumps of metal flying everywhere.'' `` The whole of the buffet car disintegrated,'' <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> said. `` The roof split open like a ripe tomato and that's how we got out. We tried to find people underneath the rubble but there was so much debris, there was nothing we could do.'' Today's was the third serious rail accident in a month in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. On Nov. 30, 15 passengers were injured when two express trains collided outside the <LOCATION> Newcastle-upon-Tyne </LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. On Nov. 12, a driver was killed and 18 passengers badly hurt in a crash near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helens </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The ambulance service said today's collision occured at the bottom of an embankment, making it difficult to reach the injured. Some cars overturned, the fire brigade said. The injured were ferried to five hospitals in a fleet of 20 ambulances. British <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> said the commuter train was the 7:18 a.m. from <LOCATION> Basingstoke </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, traveling along the main <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> line to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> station. The second train was the 6:14 a.m. from <LOCATION> Poole </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s southern coast, also heading toward <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Emmanuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> near the scene of the crash was used as a makeshift clinic. Boys from the school scrambled down the banks to help rescue survivors, and elderly people at a nearby day center handed out tea to survivors. <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a school official, said scores of passengers arrived at the school bleeding, dazed and missing teeth. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s worst crash occurred in 1915, when 227 people were killed and 246 injured in a collision between a troop train and passenger train in southwest <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court Grants Treasure Hunter Right to Salvage Pirate Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that a treasure hunter has the right to recover cargo and artifacts from the submerged 18th century pirate ship `` Whydah.'' In a unanimous opinion, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' highest court rejected the state's claim of sovereignty over the wrecked wooden sailing vessel, lying beneath the sand in the waters off <LOCATION> Wellfleet </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> where the it foundered in April 1717. `` The ill-fated <LOCATION> Whydah </LOCATION>, nearly three centuries later, has sailed into this court's jurisdiction as the subject of a dispute between contemporary treasure seekers and the would-be modern sovereign of the coastal waters,'' Justice <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> wrote for the high court. He described the case as `` a conflict mired in competing claims of title to the shipwreck and its cargo, involving issues of federal maritime and admiralty law, and disputed dominion over submerged lands in the marginal sea.'' In November 1982, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> and his salvage company, <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Underwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surveys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, found `` an unidentified, wrecked and abandoned vessel'' one mile off <LOCATION> Wellfleet </LOCATION> under about 14 feet of water and 5 feet of sand. Since 1983, Maritime Surveys, using sophisticated sensing and recovery technology, has recovered numerous artifacts from the site, while waging legal battles with the state, the federal government and rival treasure hunters over who owns the wreck of the commandeered English merchant ship. Gold, silver, cannons and pistols recovered from the ship have been valued at $ 14 million to $ 25 million, and the total bounty is estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars. After winning his claim of ownership to the <LOCATION> Whydah </LOCATION> in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> was sued by the state, which asked a state <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to confirm its claim of title to the vessel and its cargo. The <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appointed <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> temporary custodian of the wreck, and on that basis, he won a permit from the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Underwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> to salvage the ship. Later, faced with claims from <LOCATION> Clifford </LOCATION>, the state and other searchers, the state court granted <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>'s company title to the vessel.

<TEXT>
 A new $ 17 million federal prison was dedicated today in this western <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> town, replacing the detention center that rioting Cubans burned in a night of terror 13 months ago. The new beginning gives townspeople the chance to look to the future, but they should not forget the rioting, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Veron </PERSON> warned in his dedication speech. <PERSON> Veron </PERSON> recalled watching the television coverage of the prison going up in flames as <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> detainees rampaged through the <ORGANIZATION> Oakdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` I can not understand how these defendants wanted to burn down these excellent facilities they had, and think by burning them down and taking hostages they would gain their freedom,'' said <PERSON> Veron </PERSON>. `` It is not up to me, and I express no opinion on the conduct the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should take against those that destroyed $ 15 million in taxpayers' property.'' More than 1,000 Cuban inmates awaiting decisions on whether they would be freed or sent back to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> rioted and took 28 employees hostage on Nov. 21, 1987, at the <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> center. The siege lasted eight days, and the hostages were released unharmed. Although <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> officials do not want to answer specific questions about security, the new facility has some obvious differences from the old one. Within the 40-acre prison, two of the four dormitories are isolated by a high chain-link fence and a guard post. Also added is a maximum security building, which has over 50 individual cells. Each cell door has a small hole and each inmate must put his hands through that hole to be handcuffed before the door is opened. The showers also have bars. The new <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> facility will handle prisoners who have been sentenced by federal judges to prison terms. Under construction at the site is a $ 14 million federal deportation center, which will open in November 1989 to handle detainees. The rebuilt prison has 265 inmates at this time and can accommodate 1,300, prison officials said. There are 400 guards. The deportation center will have 1,000 beds and perhaps as many as another 400 guards, said a spokesman for Warden O.C. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>. About 200 people shivered through the rededication ceremonies in the open-air basketball court on the prison grounds. None of the inmates was in sight and the prison looked empty. Despite last year's riot, Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mowad </PERSON> said he looked forward to reopening the prison the community worked so hard to secure and was so proud of when it opened in 1986. `` If someone had been killed there probably would have been more bad feelings,'' he said recently. `` We're ready to get on with the program.'' The town's economy has fluctuated since the riot, and unemployment in <LOCATION> Allen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> is about 11 percent, <PERSON> Mowad </PERSON> said. `` It was 31 percent back in January 1982 when we first started this thing. It was the highest in the country,'' <PERSON> Mowad </PERSON> said. `` It was n't all the prison, but it certainly has been a major reason why unemployment -LRB- went -RRB- down.'' Rioting at the federal prisons in <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> two days later erupted shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> had agreed to take back more than 2,500 of the 3,800 Mariel refugees who were locked up nationwide at the time. More than half were in the federal detention center in <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>. The takeovers ended after the government agreed to a moratorium on deportations and a one-time-only <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> review of each <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> decision.

 Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions taken Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. NCAA-Discipline The court, in a setback for college basketball coach <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>, bolstered the power of the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> to discipline its member schools. The 5-4 ruling also could help the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in its effort to police drug use by athletes at state-run member schools. The court said the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION>, in disciplining <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>, did not violate the constitutional rights of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada-Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> coach because the athletic body acted as a private organization, not one operating with governmental authority. The case is <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>, 87-1061. MEDICARE The court barred the government from retroactively applying rules limiting reimbursement paid to hospitals treating Medicare patients. The court, in a 9-0 ruling likely to mean millions of additional dollars for some hospitals, rejected <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration arguments that some hospitals could reap a windfall from a ban on retroactive application of the government's reimbursement formula. The case is <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1097. EVIDENCE The court ruled that a government investigator's conclusions and opinions are not `` hearsay'' and may be used as evidence in federal trials. The justices reversed a federal appeals court ruling that had ordered a new trial in a wrongful-death lawsuit against the makers of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> airplane in which two people crashed six years ago. But today's 7-2 vote appeared to make a new trial necessary, because the justices also ruled that the plaintiffs' lawyers wrongly were limited in presenting their case. The case is Beech Aircraft vs. <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>, 87-981. GARBAGE The court, having already ruled that privacy rights do not extend to garbage left at curbside for pick-up, refused to treat differently garbage discarded closer to home. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that a convicted Fremont, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, man had no privacy right in garbage cans left outside for collection four feet from his home's back door. Unlike the court's decision last May in a case from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, today's order sets no national precedent. The case is <PERSON> Trahan </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, 88-697. TENURE The court agreed to study a university's attempt to withhold confidential information from a faculty member who says her denial of tenure was due to illegal discrimination. The court said it will hear an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> officials accused of discriminating against a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> woman denied promotion to full professor. But the justices indicated that they will be studying a very narrow issue in the case _ one dealing with which trial court had the authority to hear it. The case is <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION>, 88-493. LIBEL AWARD The court refused to reinstate a $ 4.5 million libel award won by a former prosecutor against the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>. The justices, citing the lack of `` a properly presented federal question,'' let stand a <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that requires a new trial for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON>'s lawsuit against the newspaper. The case is <LOCATION> Sprague </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, 88-671. HELICOPTER CRASH The court rejected an appeal by a family seeking damages for the death of a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> helicopter co-pilot. The court, without comment, refused to order a new trial in a lawsuit stemming from a 1983 helicopter crash in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The court previously used the case to give military contractors sweeping immunity from being sued. The case is <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>, 88-677. SODOMY The court threw out a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> man's sodomy conviction because he was barred at his trial from questioning the alleged victim, a white woman, about her living with a black man. By a 7-1 vote, the justices overturned the conviction and 10-year prison sentence of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Olden </PERSON>. The court expressed skepticism about the alleged victim's testimony that she did not consent to have sex with Olden. At the trial, the defendants' lawyers sought to introduce evidence that the woman was living with another man, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, who is black and a half-brother of Olden. The trial judge refused to let the defense lawyers question the woman about whether she was living with <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. The judge said allowing evidence of an inter-racial living arragnment would have created `` extreme prejudice'' against the woman. The case is Olden vs. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, 88-5223. VOTING RIGHTS The court upheld a voting rights ruling that led to the election of a black <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member from <LOCATION> Crittenden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The court, by an 8-0 vote, ruled against an appeal by Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> officials that had challenged the election of <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> as a state legislator. CLEAN WATER The court asked the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for its view of a fine of nearly $ 1 million against a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> paper mill operator for failing to comply with a federal clean water law's reporting requirements. The court said it wants to hear from <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers before acting on a challenge to a key provision of the act authorizing citizens and environmental groups to sue alleged polluters. feet away, even under mounds of concrete. Orange-clad German <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> volunteers follow their search dogs, telling the exhausted Soviets where they should dig first. They work around the clock, aided by the campfires after dark. The volunteers had a moment of joy Sunday when a 33-year-old man was found alive after more than four days under a collapsed, three-story building. Hundreds of onlookers stood on the rubble as rescuer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> slowly extracted the survivor. He said his name was <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> as he was carried away on a stretcher, with jubilant Armenians feeding him water and pressing a cigarette into his trembling hand. Reflecting the chaos in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, there was no ambulance to take him to a makeshift hospital outside the city center. After a few frantic minutes, the rescuers commandeered the van used to transport the German search dogs. The scene kindled little hope in despairing relatives like <PERSON> Gegush </PERSON> <PERSON> Aganyan </PERSON>, a 50-year-old woman who stood a tearful vigil by her son's wrecked apartment She came from a mountain village in hopes her son, <PERSON> Tateus </PERSON>, and his pregnant wife had somehow survived. `` It was to be my first grandchild,'' she said. `` But I think there is no chance for them to be found alive.'' Others searchers reported miraculous tales of survival amid the more common discoveries of entombed families. `` We still have hope, although not much,'' said <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Tovmasyan </PERSON>, a volunteer directing the cranes lifting concrete slabs and corrugated metal roofing. He said he had helped dig out 12 survivors in the past three days. A list of fewer than 2,000 survivors has been written on green sheets of paper at a shack marked with a hand-lettered sign: `` Regional Communist Party.'' Hundreds clamor around it, shouting the names of those they seek. `` We already know who is missing from here,'' said <PERSON> Zori </PERSON> <PERSON> Zayakan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Martuni </LOCATION>, a village about 100 miles from <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>. `` The reunification effort is disorderly, but people know they can find out if they ask at enough places.'' Another survivor, <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Arzumanyan </PERSON>, said outside his obliterated apartment that he ran home from the factory as soon as the main earthquake stopped. At first he was shocked that the seven stories above his second-floor home were spread like gray boxes in front of the foundation, then noticed his rear apartment had been exposed by the collapse. `` I pulled my two granddaughters and my younger daughter out myself,'' said <PERSON> Arzumanyan </PERSON>, 54. `` My wife and my older daughter were in the city to buy groceries. I did n't know what happened to them until yesterday -LRB- Saturday -RRB-.'' His wife survived, but his 27-year-old daughter was flown to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in critical condition and he did not know her fate. Like others remaining in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arzumanyan </PERSON> has been camping in the near-freezing weather with bedding salvaged from the wreckage, waiting for debris to be cleared away. He says he must find documents and a stash of money to help his family resettle. Most of the homeless have been taken to undamaged areas of the mountainous republic or bused to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, where they wait for flights or other transport to stay with relatives elsewhere. The discomfort of waiting without lodging, food or access to toilets is mostly taken in stride by Armenians who see the earthquake as another chapter in their tragic history. `` We lost 1.5 million people in 1915,'' said <PERSON> Varchik </PERSON> <PERSON> Azaryan </PERSON>, resurrecting the bloody Turkish invasion of 73 years ago. `` We have survived that as a nation and we will survive whatever fate we meet.''

 <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s principal arms control adviser, said Monday that Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plan to turn a controversial radar installation in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> over to civilian and eventually international control does not satisfy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has long maintained that the radar at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> should be torn down because it violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistc Missile treaty. The treaty permits radars on national borders pointed outward to detect incoming missiles. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar is a violation because it is in the middle of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> territory facing inward where it might be used in an early-warning battle management system. `` Turning it over to Soviet and international scientists is n't satisfactory to us,'' <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON> said `` There is no way we can be certain these civilian scientsts will remain in charge,'' he said. `` They could convert it to an early-warning radar in no time at all.'' <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON> commented in an interview by international journalists and others on Worldnet, a television production of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> beamed overseas.

 <PERSON> Sonja </PERSON> <PERSON> Henie </PERSON>'s icy heart wo n't be left out in the cold when the warehouse where it has been stored for nearly 48 years is demolished to make room for a frozen foods plant. The blue-green ice sculpture was presented to the famous Norweigian skater and movie star during a Valentine's Day 1941 performance at the Ak-Sar-Ben Coliseum _ the star's one and only appearance in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Henie </PERSON> said she would return for it some day. But she died in 1969 without ever claiming what <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> newsman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuralt </PERSON> once called `` the longest-running, open-ended, most enduring publicity stunt of all time.'' <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldfield </PERSON>, who was an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> publicist when he carved the heart, said Miss <PERSON> Henie </PERSON> found her appearance in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> less than heart-warming. Among other things, he said, she was upset that high costs cut into her profits. `` All she was really interested in that night was to get it ... out of the dressing room because it had green-blue dye and it was dripping on her dressing room floor,'' <PERSON> Oldfield </PERSON>, now an executive for <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, office. So the heart was taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> warehouse near the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and there it has remained over the years, gaining in notoriety as it shrunk from its original 100 pounds to about 60 pounds. `` It is highly flattering that something made 45 years ago out of the most perishable substance on earth _ frozen water _ would still be in existence in a cold storage warehouse in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Oldfield </PERSON> said. When plans were announced to tear down the warehouse to make way for a new <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> frozen foods complex, there was some concern about the fate of the heart. But <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattson </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storage </ORGANIZATION>, said he has moved the sculpture to his company's new warehouse in a converted meat-packing plant. `` It's in a box in a room with a lot of raw materials for making pet food _ liver, salisbury glands, items like that,'' <PERSON> Mattson </PERSON> said. `` I'd hate to throw it away. I'd probably get in trouble.'' `` I suppose some good-hearted guy will continue to take care of it,'' <PERSON> Oldfield </PERSON> said. `` It has been kind of like a relay race. There have been 10 or 12 people who had custody of it from one time to another.'' <PERSON> Oldfield </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, said he hoped to visit the heart during a trip to <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> later this month. He recalled how the ice show's promoter approached him in 1941 about a publicity stunt, but warned <PERSON> Oldfield </PERSON> that Miss <PERSON> Henie </PERSON> was n't always friendly. <PERSON> Oldfield </PERSON> carved the heart out of a keg of ice and presented it to Miss <PERSON> Henie </PERSON> at the Valentine show. As the promoter had warned, however, she gave <PERSON> Oldfield </PERSON> the cold shoulder. `` As kind of an exit line, I said we would keep it until she came back to <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> again,'' <PERSON> Oldfield </PERSON> said. `` We put it in the back of a pickup _ it was 10 degrees below zero that night. After the show we took it to <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storage </ORGANIZATION> and stored it there. It was forgotton until I came back after World War II and was in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> for Christmas before the victory march in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Oldfield </PERSON> said no one has tried to buy the heart but that the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> has called about it. `` They found somebody with a 36-year-old cake in storage and they were toying with the idea of a strange category that would include such things, but nothing came of it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a setback for college basketball coach <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>, today bolstered the power of the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> to discipline its member schools. The 5-4 ruling also could help the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in its effort to police drug use by athletes at state-run member schools. The court said the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION>, in disciplining <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>, did not violate the constitutional rights of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada-Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> coach because the athletic body acted as a private organization, not one operating with governmental authority. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, writing for the court, said the university does have governmental power because it is a state-run school. But <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION>, in seeking to discipline <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>, was acting independently from <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION> acted much more like adversaries than like partners engaged in a dispassionate search for the truth'' in investigating <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> `` is more correctly characterized as an agent of its remaining members, which, as competitors of <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION>, had an interest in the effective and evenhanded enforcement of <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION>'s recruitment standards,'' he said. The ruling's impact on <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>'s career at <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION> _ or the school's big-time basketball program _ was not immediately apparent. `` I ca n't say at this point what will happen to Mr. <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitchen </PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION>'s lawyers in the case. `` That's a matter the committee on infractions will have to take a look at,'' he said. `` As far as the impact on the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> itself, this is a good decision,'' Kitchen added. <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>, when told about the decision, said, `` Naturally, I'm disappointed. He refused to discuss what action <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION> might take in his case, saying, `` I do n't want to get into that right now. I'm going to let my lawyer talk for me.'' But <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>'s lawyer, said he did not want to discuss the decision until he had a chance to read the court's opinions <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>, a highly successful coach who has been at <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION> since 1973, was accused in 1976 of numerous rule violations by the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said he arranged for a student to bet a `` B'' grade without attending class, provided free air fare to a student-athlete, encouraged individuals to give the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> false information to impede its probe, falsely certified <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION>'s program as being in compliance with <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> rules and failed to comply with high ethical standards. The <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> placed the <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION> basketball program on two years' probation in 1977 for recruiting violations and ordered the university to suspend <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> from coaching for two years But <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> obtained a court order blocking the suspension and continued coaching. The <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> had violated <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>'s constitutional rights by failing to afford him due process during its lengthy investigation Today, however, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned the lower court order in ruling that the athltic organization, lacking governmental authority, was not required to adhere to constitutional standards in its probe. <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>'s lawyers had warned that lifting the court order against the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> could mean the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> may throw <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION> out as a member if the university refuses to suspend <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>. Individuals and private organizations generally can not violate someone's constitutional rights. Only a government and its agents can do that because the Constitution protects against governmental, but not private, wrongdoing. The <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> is a private organization representing nearly 1,000 colleges and universities, more than half of them state-run. Today's ruling could enhance the organization's power to investigate drug abuse by athletes by not requiring it to observe constitutional restrictions in probing for abuses. In other action, the court: _ Barred the government from retroactively applying rules limiting reimbursement paid to hospitals treating Medicare patients. The court, in a 9-0 ruling likely to mean millions of additional dollars for some hospitals, rejected <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration arguments that some hospitals could reap a windfall from a ban on retroactive application of the government's reimbursement formula. _ Ruled that a governfment investigator's conclusions and opinions are not `` hearsay'' and may be used as evidence in federal trials. The justices reversed a federal appeals court ruling that had ordered a new trial in a wrongful-death lawsuit against the makers of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> airplane in which two people crashed six years ago. _ Having already ruled that privacy rights do not extend to garbage left at curbside for pick-up, refused to treat differently garbage discarded closer to home. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that a convicted Fremont, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, man had no privacy right in garbage cans left outside for collection four feet from his home's back door. Unlike the court's decision last May in a case from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, today's order sets no national precedent. _ Agreed to study a university's attempt to withhold confidential information from a faculty member who says her denial of tenure was due to illegal discrimination. The court said it will hear an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> officials accused of discriminating against a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> woman denied promotion to full professor. But the justices indicated that they will be studying a very narrow issue in the case _ one dealing with which trial court had the authority to hear it. _ Refused to reinstate a $ 4.5 million libel award won by a former prosecutor against the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>. The justices, citing the lack of `` a properly presented federal question,'' let stand a <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that requires a new trial for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON>'s lawsuit against the newspaper. _ Rejected an appeal by a family seeking damages for the death of a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> helicopter co-pilot. The court, without comment, refused to order a new trial in a lawsuit stemming from a 1983 helicopter crash in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The court previously used the case to give military contractors sweeping immunity from being sued. In today's high court opinion in the <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> case, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> is properly viewed as a private actor at odds with the state when it represents the interests of its entire membership in an investigation of one public university.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said the fact that <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION> could forfeit its standing as a basketball `` powerhouse'' if it is kicked out of the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> does not mean the university was forced to fire <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>. `` That <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION>'s options were unpalatable does not mean that they were nonexistent,'' he said. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was joined by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Dissenting were Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. White, in an opinion joined by the others, said <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement to abide by <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> rules governing conduct of its athletic program made the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> a partner with the university in disciplining <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>. `` I would find that the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> acted jointly with <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION> and therefore is a state actor,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. The case is <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>, 87-1061.

 Six people, including a young <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman, were injured today when a firebomb was thrown at a passenger bus in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, causing the bus to crash into a wall and a parked car, police said. Among the injured was <PERSON> Salwa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanana </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, who was seen lying in an ambulance wearing a neck brace. Hospital officials said five other bus passengers received light injuries. Police closed off <LOCATION> Saladin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s main commercial street where the crash occurred, to search for the assailant. `` The moment the bottle was thrown, the front windshield of the bus was covered in fire and smoke,'' Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> Maod </PERSON> <PERSON> Halevi </PERSON> said. `` The driver kept going until he slammed into a wall and a Subaru nearby.'' Earlier, riot police chased stone-throwing Palestinian school girls into a sacred mosque complex in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and fired tear gas at the demonstrators, witnesses said. Police said four demonstrators were arrested. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, merchants shuttered their stores for a second straight day to mourn the deaths of two residents killed Saturday by army gunfire. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, troops raided the village of <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and ordered residents to paint over pro-PLO slogans. Villagers stoned soldiers who opened fire, wounding a 22-year-old in the left leg, said officials at <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. The protest in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> erupted on the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, which is sacred to Moslems and Jews. The mount, known in Arabic as <PERSON> Haram </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sharif </PERSON> or Noble Enclosure, houses the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosque and Dome of the Rock shrine _ the holiest sites in <LOCATION> Islam </LOCATION> after Mecca and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. Several hundred teen-age girls gathered in front of their religious high school inside the complex, chanting `` Allahu Akhbar'' -LRB- God is great -RRB- and throwing stones at police, said police and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> merchants in the area. Police entered the complex and started firing tear gas, said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> which administers the two mosques. `` While I was talking to the girls about what was going on, they -LRB- police -RRB- shot four canisters inside the school, and then they shot more and more,'' <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said none of the tear gas got into the mosques, which are about 50 and 100 yards from the school. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> and his assistants could not be reached for comment despite several calls to their office and residences. <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> said he asked the students to go home, and most eventually dispersed. A group of about 50 continued to chant `` Allahu Akbar'' on their way to east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s central bus station, where mounted police charged into the group. AP photographer <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> said the teen-agers fled into the narrow corridors of the station, pursued by club-wielding mounted police. One, about 16, grabbed a policeman's club and tried to pull him off the horse, <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> said. Police hit some teen-agers who responded by throwing rocks and bottles. Police charged into buses in search of agitators. Three girls and one boy were detained. <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> shops were closed to mourn the deaths Saturday of a 16-year-old <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> youth who hurled a firebomb at soldiers and an Arab prisoner who attacked a guard with a homemade knife. The deaths brought to 322 the number of Palestinians killed in the year-long revolt against Israeli rule. Eleven Israelis also have been killed.

<TEXT>
 The space shuttle Atlantis continued its cross-country trip from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> today, taking off from an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base near <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> atop a modified jumbo jet. The orbiter, which landed at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last week after completing a classified military mission, left the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> base at 3:27 p.m. Sunday, said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, shuttle area manager for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION>. Carried piggyback atop a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> reached <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s Davis-Monthan Air Force Base 90 minutes later, where it stayed overnight. The plane took off from the base shortly before noon on the next leg of its trip, headed to <ORGANIZATION> Kelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. 747, the shuttle The final leg should take the shuttle from <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> to the Kennedy Space Center at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Agostino </PERSON>. Rain could delay completion of the flight, he said Sunday. Flying through rain can damage the thousands of ceramic tiles affixed to the shuttle's belly to ward off the heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, he said. Atlantis landed Tuesday after a four-day secret mission that reportedly included deployment of a med to a mechanical air pump so the bear mimics the deep, gentle inhaling and exhaling of a healthy, sleeping person. A research project under way at the university and <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> has shown that the bears can help regulate breathing by inducing deep, quiet sleep in preemies, who frequently suffer respiratory disorders, said <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoman </PERSON>, the behaviorist who designed the project. `` This is a stimulation that I call biologically relevant,'' <PERSON> Thoman </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` It's sort of like having a companion to sleep with. It's breathing, just like mummy and daddy.'' <PERSON> Thoman </PERSON> came up with the idea about 15 years ago and experimented on rat pups deprived of their mothers. Those given a surrogate mother _ a warm, moist, pulsating tube _ survived. Those without a surrogate died. Premature infants were a natural subject for the study, since they too are separated from their mothers when they are isolated in an incubator. It took <PERSON> Thoman </PERSON> years to come up with the design for the bear _ commercially made ones have protruding snouts and limbs that keep infants at a distance _ and a pump that could duplicate the gentle rhythm of human breathing. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apparatus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Natick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, developed the pump. After some preliminary work, she got a $ 500,000 grant from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ahd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Develpment </ORGANIZATION> for a three-year study that runs until May. <PERSON> Thoman </PERSON> and her research assistants monitor how the babies respond to the bears through time-lapse photography. The experiment is based partly on the physics principle of entrainment, which holds that all pulsating or beating objects, animate and inanimate, tend to match the rhythms of nearby objects. The phenomenon explains why a half-dozen grandfather clocks on the same wall, all beating at different tempos, eventually will synchronize. In people, it means the various body rhythms _ sleep patterns, temperature, breathing, heartbeat _ influence each other, <PERSON> Thoman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thoman </PERSON> theorizes that the bears may calm colicky babies, and that aside from helping infants learn to breathe the bears stimulate brain development by letting the babies choose when to snuggle up to the toys. Doctors have known for years that underdeveloped, premature infants, isolated in an incubator away from their mothers and the outside world, need stimulation to thrive. But the stimulation used for years has been passive and inescapable: the incessant sound of an electrical heart implanted in a stuffed animal, the rising and falling of a breathing air mattress. The babies in the experiment snuggle with their bears about half the time, and move away by themselves the rest of the time. <PERSON> Thoman </PERSON>'s bears have been mentioned in writings on sudden infant death syndrome, but she cautions that it's far too early to theorize that a device that helps regulate breathing will help prevent the mysterious killer of apparently healthy babies. `` We have demonstrated the bear facilitates maturation and that it helps the babies breathe more regularly,'' she said. `` There is a logical jump to say, ` Should n't -LRB- that -RRB- help prevent SIDS?' And in my wildest dreams, I would hope so. But that's too far away, there is too much research to be done.''

<HEAD>Americans Say Christmas Too Commercial, But Still Plan to Buy</HEAD>

 Americans are in a giving mood this Christmas, although a vast majority believe the holiday has become too commercialized, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll. Three-quarters of those answering the poll said they intend to spend the same amount of money or more on gifts than in past years, and fewer than one in four intend to spend less. Seven years ago, when joblessness and inflation were considerably higher, an AP-NBC News poll found that 69 percent of the public intended to cut back on gift-giving. The new poll found that 85 percent of the public believes that Christmas is too commercialized, but 87 percent still said they looked forward to it. The survey of 1,084 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was conducted by telephone between Nov. 10 and Nov. 20. Ninety-six percent of those answering the survey said they celebrate Christmas. Eighty-nine percent identified themselves as either Catholic or Protestant; the rest were Jewish, `` other,'' or had no religion. The poll indicated that most Americans are religious, although religious observance varied considerably among regions and among different ethnic and social groups. About a third of the public thinks of Christmas as mainly a social holiday, while about one-quarter regard it as primarily religious. But the largest number _ 38 percent _ consider it both religious and social. The poll also showed that nearly seven in 10 Americans are churchgoers, and four in 10 said they had been to church the week before the poll. Sixty-four percent said they generally go to church on Christmas. The poll found that most Americans intend to spend at least $ 200 on Christmas gifts this year, and one in four will spend at least $ 500. Sixty-nine percent intend to give gifts to at least 10 other people, and 20 percent will be giving to 20 or more people. Only 3 percent do n't plan to give any gifts. Seven in 10 people said they usually receive the gifts they really want for Christmas, while one-quarter do n't. The poll showed that younger adults are more likely to look forward to Christmas than their elders, and that they also are much more likely to view Christmas as a primarily social, and not religious, holiday. Older people are much more likely to view Christmas as overly commercialized. The poll also indicated that Americans who live in the South and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> are more religiously observant than those in the West and <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION>, and that black Americans are more religiously observant than whites, conservatives more than liberals. For instance, 75 percent of those in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and 71 percent of those in the North-Central states said they attend church services during the year, compared to 69 percent in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and 57 percent in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Eighty-three percent of blacks are churchgoers, compared to 69 percent of whites; 75 percent of conservatives compared to 56 percent of liberals. Overall, the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, but a somewhat higher error rate for answers involving subgroups. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 The only hard feelings following pop star <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s libel suit against a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper came from a judge who castigated both sides for milking the case for publicity. `` Sorry Elton,'' said the headline over a front-page story in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>'s late edition Monday announcing a $ 1.84 million out-of-court settlement, and the paper quoted <PERSON> John </PERSON> as saying: `` This is the best Christmas present I could wish for ... and I do n't bear The Sun any malice.'' But High Court Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, who had been scheduled to begin hearing <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s action later Monday, voiced his `` disapproval and distaste'' at the way the settlement was announced in The Sun before it could be approved by the court. `` One would think that <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> and the newspaper had formed a mutual admiration society,'' he said. `` The parties were determined to milk the situation in order to obtain the maximum publicity to both sides.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> told reporters: `` I do n't think it is any of the judge's business.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will bar timber harvesting in certain parts of national forests in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in order to broaden habitat protection for the spotted owl, the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said most of the new habitat areas will range from 1,000 to 2,000 acres in size, and will serve as protection for nesting owls as well as providing `` stepping stones'' between larger areas, totaling more than 1.6 million acres, already protected as owl habitats. In the Olympic National Forest, the new habitat areas may be as large as 3,000 acres each, he said. In all, the special habitat areas are expected to reduce the annual timber harvest on national forests in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by about 180 million board feet. Each of the 13 national forests that have owls will share in the linkage system. The exact number will not be determined until the forests submit final management plans to ensure that spotted owl populations will be maintained. `` This has been an extremely difficult decision to make, but I believe it strikes a reasonable balance between the two conflicting goals of sustaining spotted owl populations and providing timber supplies that are vital to the economies of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency, has been embroiled in controversy concerning its management plans for spotted owl habitats, notably in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> where there are concerns that protection of the birds could adversely affect the timber industry. However, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said the controversy has not been confined to his agency, noting that a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> has resulted in an injunction prohibiting <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> from harvesting mature timber on some lands the agency administers in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Also, the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is being challenged in court over its 1987 refusal to designate the owl a threatened or endangered species. Meantime, authorities in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> voted last week to deny a place on the state list of endangered or threatened species to a robin-sized seabird called the marbled murrelet after biologists were unable to determine the bird's population. `` We simply do n't have good baseline data on the murrelet's population size nor any trends indicating changes in that population,'' said <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>, chief of the wildlife division for the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> The Oregon chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had petitioned to place the bird on the list under the new Oregon Endangered Species Act last January.

<TEXT>
 A potentially dangerous shortage of nurses in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is best solved by boosting pay scales for career caregivers and making sure they have time to be nurses instead of clerks, a federal commission said Monday. `` It is the sincere belief of the commission that the health of this nation will be at risk if the changes suggested in these recommendations do not occur,'' the report said. `` The institutions themselves have to change the very way they allow nursing to be practiced,'' <PERSON> Carolyne </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, head of the special advisory panel, said at a news conference. The report said higher pay will help, particularly for career nurses, but that better financial compensation alone is not the answer. The commission was convened a year ago by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. An underlying theme of its report, which to be presented to <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, is that nurses yearn for time to nurse. Nurses also want recognition for their nurturing instincts and acquired knowledge, and they want to be respected and consulted by the physicians who write up the orders telling them how to care for their patients, the report said. `` With increasing frequency, nurses provide services that should be carried out by other health care workers,'' the commission said. The report said hospitals `` should preserve the time of the nurse for the direct care of patients and families by providing adequate staffing levels for clinical and non-clinical support services.'' Without using the word doctor, another recommendation said, `` Close cooperation and mutual respect between nursing and medicine is essential.'' On the pay issue, the panel said starting salaries are not so much a problem as the lack of opportunity to see compensation grow with experience. It cited statistics showing that while the average $ 22,000 starting salary for a nurse two years ago was only $ 2,000 below that for an engineer, the engineer was making $ 41,000 five years later compared with $ 27,000 for the nurse. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the current average salary for all working registered nurses is $ 25,000 a year. Calculating that there are at least 137,000 `` budgeted vacancies in just the hospital and nursing home sectors alone,'' the panel said hospitals have laid off 100,000 non-nursing employees over the past five years. Although nursing school enrollments are down, the commission said a growing demand for nurses is more a factor in the shortage than lack of people in training _ partly because the patients now being hospitalized tend to be sicker as a group than a few years ago. Outpatient treatment is now more likely for the less seriously ill, leaving hospitals with the most difficult cases and the accompanying need for a higher nurse-to-patient ratio. `` Unless this shortage is addressed, I can anticipate there might be some impact on the quality of care,'' said <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, the federal official designated to coordinate the panel's work. The document was welcomed by the Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals. `` The commission's recommendations are very similar to what we have been advocating for a long time,'' said <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> <PERSON> Owley </PERSON>, the union's vice president. `` We are encouraged that the federal government has finally given proper recognition to the problems of the nursing profession and has offered some concrete solutions to the crisis.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> also said it welcomed `` the substantive actions'' recommended by the commission. `` Nursing is a critical national resource,'' said <PERSON> Geraldene </PERSON> <PERSON> Felton </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AACN </ORGANIZATION> president, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> commission. `` The nation's enormous concern and efforts to relieve the shortage are clear evidence of the crucial value of that resource. We must move forward and not ignore the important plan of action proposed by the commission today.''

 Mourning Tibetans made shrines of stones around pools of dried blood on Monday, a day after a clash with police who were seen taking residents from their homes, Western travelers said. Travelers reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> said they heard unconfirmed reports of Tibetans throwing stones at police patrols after dark Sunday and of police firing tear gas. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official media has not reported any arrests, but said one Tibetan <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk was killed and 13 people were injured when police fired warning shots Saturday at 30 Tibetans who marched into the central square waving their banned nationalist flag. An English-speaking tourist who asked not to be identified said some Tibetans told her their friends and relatives had disappeared and were believed arrested. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, said he saw police drive up to Tibetan homes, talk to residents and lead some away. `` One particular -LRB- official -RRB- I saw four times at four different homes, taking four different people away,'' he said.

Police on Monday confiscated the passport of a Dutch woman who was shot in the arm, and the ticket office for the state airline said she was not allowed to leave town, a <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> friend said. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newfoundland </ORGANIZATION> in St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s, said he tried to buy a ticket to <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, but was refused. Ms. <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON> was treated at a <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> hospital and released. `` We wanted to take her to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and put her in a hospital,'' said <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> witnessed Saturday's protest, but both said they had no connections to anti-Chinese Tibetan activists. Dutch consular attache <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> he would ask <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities to allow Ms. <PERSON> Meindersma </PERSON> to leave. `` I hope this is just a formality,'' he said, adding he was disappointed authorities had given him little information on her condition. Tibetan nationalists, including <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and nuns, dispute <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s claim to seven centuries of sovereignty over <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. They want an independent country led by the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, the leader of Tibetan Buddhism who has been in exile in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> since an abortive anti-Chinese uprising in 1959. Tibetans have staged many small protests in the past 14 months, but Saturday's was the third to turn bloody. At least 38 people were killed in violent clashes with police Oct. 1 and March 5. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has maintained that foreign travelers took part in some previous protests, but has not made such charges about Saturday's violence Police searched guest rooms at the Yak backpacker hotel Sunday and Monday, said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` They seem to be looking for particular individuals who they believe were eyewitnesses,'' he said.

 A Cuban exile who tried to hijack a commercial airliner to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> but was tricked into landing on an island south of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> was questioned Monday by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents trying to learn his motive, officials said. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 26, allegedly used a fake bomb to demand the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, be diverted to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He was arrested after the plane landed instead in the Turks and <LOCATION> Caicos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, a British colony. `` They tricked him good and nobody got hurt _ that's the important thing,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The hijacking attempt, only the second attempt on a domestic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airliner in more than two years, ended when the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 and its 121 passengers flew on to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Sunday night. `` All we know for sure is that the man wanted to go to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` He apparently wanted to see his mother _ she was either very sick or dying.

 One of 10 children who made and sold pottery to pay for her education in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nicolasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Menchu </PERSON> was used to beating the odds when she arrived here in 1986 with a serious spinal curvature that doctors said eventually would have killed her. Almost three years later, she is on her way back to her native land, not only out of danger, but 2 -LCB- inches taller and with a bachelor's degree in elementary education from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION>. At a farewell party at the university last Friday, the huge smile that has become `` <PERSON> Niko </PERSON>'s'' trademark among her friends said it all. `` I feel excited and at the same time I feel sad,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Menchu </PERSON>, who recently celebrated her 28th birthday. `` I have so much to say thank you for to all the people who helped me make my goals.'' Ms. <PERSON> Menchu </PERSON>'s ordeal began last fall when she developed breathing problems while swimming. She was turned over to Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, co-director of the spine clinic at <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Norton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Menchu </PERSON> underwent a series of four operations, all free, to correct a 142-degree curvature of her spine that was choking off her vital organs.

<HEAD>Likud and Labor Hold New Coalition Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor negotiators met for six hours Monday about a possible coalition government of the two main parties, and Labor demanded electoral reforms to curb the power of religious parties. Small religious parties won 18 of the 120 parliament seats in the Nov. 1 election and hold the balance of power between the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, which got 40 seats, and the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with 39. They have demanded important Cabinet posts and stricter government policies on religion as terms for joining a right-wing coalition with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, led by Prime Minster <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. Negotiators from both major parties reported progress in Monday's talks and some predicted a coalition deal would be made this week <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor, whose leader is Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, have been equal partners in a `` national unity'' coalition since the indecisive election of July 1984. The leaders traded jobs two years ago. Many issues appeared unresolved after the meeting of the three-member teams Monday in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzav </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister, told <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> as he emerged: `` There was progress. There are still a few open questions, but ... we have established intensive discussions and we want to finish as soon as possible. I hope that we conclude the discussions in a day or two.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the negotiators focused on guidelines for a joint government and agreed to an evenly divided Inner Cabinet, which makes the major security and foreign policy decisions. A Labor official close to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said privately the party demanded electoral reforms, including direct election of the prime minister and requiring more votes to qualify for a seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliament. Each party assigns <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> seats from its own candidate list on the basis of how many votes it receives. Requiring more votes per seat would make it difficult for smaller parties to get into parliament, thus limiting the power of religious parties, among others. After negotiating with right-wing and religious parties, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> turned back to Labor in an apparent effort to avoid major concessions on religious and political issues demanded by the small factions. His talks with those parties continue, however, and officials close to the prime minister said the factions may join whatever government is formed. The Peres aide said Labor opposes <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement with the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Tehiya </ORGANIZATION> and National Religious parties to build 40 new Jewish settlements in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in the next four years. Six new settlements were authorized in the four years of <ORGANIZATION> Labor-Likud </ORGANIZATION> coalition that began in 1984. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, an adviser to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> wants more emphasis on new settlements but is prepared to `` reconsider'' if Labor joins the government. About 70,000 Jews live in more than 130 settlements in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, where a rebellion began a year ago among the 1.5 million Palestinian residents. According to the <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> aide, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> will insist on the right to oppose such religious legislation as the proposed `` Who Is a Jew'' law, which would accept only conversions to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> performed by Orthodox rabbis. Jews in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where the Conservative and Reform movements are strong, oppose the legislation.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today threw out a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> man's sodomy conviction because he was barred at his trial from questioning the alleged victim, a white woman, about her living with a black man. By an 8-1 vote, the justices overturned the conviction and 10-year prison sentence of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Olden </PERSON>. The court expressed skepticism about the alleged victim's testimony that she did not consent to have sex with Olden. Olden and a friend, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, were indicted on kidnapping, rape and forcible sodomy charges. Both men, who are black, were accused of forcing a young white woman to have sex with them after they met her at a bar in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, Ky. The woman initally told police she was raped by four men; later said she was raped by Olden and <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, and at trial said <PERSON> Olden </PERSON> was the sole rapist. She also testified at trial that Olden threatened her with a knife, although in earlier statements to police she did not allege that he was armed. Olden and <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said the woman consented to having sex with them. At the trial, the defendants' lawyers sought to introduce evidence that the woman was living with another man, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, who is black and a half-brother of Olden. The defense lawyers said the woman concocted the story of being raped to prevent <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> from learning the truth that she consented to sex with the defendants. The trial judge refused to let the defense lawyers question the woman about whether she was living with <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. The judge said allowing evidence of an inter-racial living arragnment would have created `` extreme prejudice'' against the woman. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was acquitted. Olden was acquitted of kidnapping and rape, but convicted of forcing the woman to commit sodomy. But today the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Olden </PERSON>'s right to confront his accuser was violated by excluding the evidence of the alleged victim's living arrangement. In an unsigned opinion, the court said, `` Speculation as to the effect of jurors' racial biases can not justify exclusion of cross-examination with such strong potential to demonstrate the falsity of -LRB- the alleged victim's -RRB- testimony.'' Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> dissented on grounds that the court should have held formal arguments in the case rather than summarily reversimg Olden's conviction. The case is Olden vs. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, 88-5223.

 Armed men raided a village near <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Monday, killing two people and burning several huts, a news agency reported.

<TEXT>
 Policymakers at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, concerned about renewed signs of inflationary pressures, are poised to drive interest rates higher in a move that will put the central bank on a collision course with the incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, private economists said Monday. Many analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has already begun to tighten credit conditions and they predicted that its <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will vote for more restrictive policies at closed-door strategy sessions Tuesday and Wednesday. Analysts said they based this belief on the fact that recent economic statistics have pointed to an economy still barreling ahead, with inflationary pressures rising. Unemployment, at 5.4 percent in November, is close to 14-year lows, leading many economists to worry that tight labor markets and high factory operating rates will trigger price increases as production constraints bump up against high demand. `` The data on growth and inflation clearly suggest the need for further tightening,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Major banks boosted their prime lending rate two weeks ago to 10.5 percent, the fourth increase this year and the highest level for this benchmark business and consumer rate since mid-1985. Many economists said they were looking for the prime rate to move up to 11 percent by late January, with similar increases in other interest rates. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer, said he expects mortgage rates that averaged 10.46 percent for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages last week to climb. `` By early next year, I would look for mortgage rates to be around 11 percent to 11.25 percent and rising,'' he said. `` Mortgage borrowers should borrow now instead of waiting.'' Many economists said they were looking for another rise in banks' prime lending rate, but some said they did not think it would occur until the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> hikes its discount rate, a move they predicted would occur by late January An increase in the discount rate _ the interest the central bank charges on loans to member commercial banks _ is the most dramatic signal the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can send of its intention to push interest rates higher as a way of slowing an overheated economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> last hiked the discount rate on Aug. 9, pushing it to 6.5 percent. That move capped a series of less-noticeable credit tightening steps the central bank had begun in late March. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can also influence interest rates by selling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities to banks, reducing the amount of money the banks have to support their loan activities. This drives up the cost of those loans, interest rates. Many analysts say they have detected signs that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is once again tightening credit behind the scenes. They note that the federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, has been rising. It averaged 8.59 percent last week, the highest weekly average in two years and up from 8.44 percent the week before. Some analysts, however, argued that the rise in the federal funds rate had occurred because of increased borrowing demand and not from any overt tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. But regardless of the reason, analysts said they expected the central bank would go along with the trend toward higher interest rates in coming weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> `` is a gradualist and I think we will see lots of small steps toward higher rates,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. An effort to fight inflation by boosting interest rates is not likely to sit well with President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is counting on robust economic growth to generate the higher government revenues he needs to balance the budget without raising taxes. Higher interest rates worsen the deficit in two ways. They hold down economic growth and drive up the federal government's own borrowing costs. Interest on the $ 2.6 trillion national debt is now the third-highest government spending category behind defense and the programs in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is projecting economic growth, as measured by the gross national product, of around 2 percent to 2.5 percent, far below the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's forecast of 3.5 percent GNP growth next year. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is likely to adopt the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> economic forecast when it presents its own budget blueprint to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because the higher growth forecast lowers the need for painful budget cuts to erase the deficit. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> believes we are at full employment and we ca n't tolerate strong growth any longer and it is time to hit the brakes,'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said `` That means the administration's job in terms of balancing the budget will be much harder.'' The Federal Open Market Committee is composed of members of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and presidents of its regional banks and meets every six to eight weeks. Its decisions at those private sessions are not disclosed until after the next meeting is held.

<HEAD>Police Say Drinking Boy Stole Plane, Landed Safely At Busy Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 17-year-old boy who police say had been drinking because of family problems took a small plane on a three-hour flight through some of the nation's busiest airspace before another pilot talked him down. Air traffic controllers and some commercial flights were on alert Saturday night as the boy, who had only a few hours of flying instruction, zigged and zagged across major air corridors serving <ORGANIZATION> Newark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> airports. The boy, whose name was withheld because of his age, allegedly broke into a trailer at <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and took keys to a single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 172, <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said. `` He got the plane off the ground, and I guess nobody noticed because the airport is closed at night,'' <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said. `` It was pretty good in the dark.'' The stolen plane went unnoticed until the boy got about 18 miles away from the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> airport and began radioing a `` mayday'' distress signal, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which owns and operates the three major airports. The signal was heard all along the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> region's air traffic facilities, said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` The kid is not a pilot, and he allegedly was intoxicated when he was flying around,'' she said. `` It's not that busy after midnight on a Saturday and it's a good thing.'' The boy told police he was having family problems, <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Malawich </PERSON>, a corporate charter plane pilot heading for <LOCATION> Teterboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, heard the boy's call for help and went in search of the other plane. `` It took 15 minutes to find him,'' <PERSON> Malawich </PERSON> said. `` He was kind of scared and disoriented.'' <PERSON> Malawich </PERSON> radioed the boy and told him to follow his tail lights to <ORGANIZATION> Newark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. At one point, the boy lost sight of the corporate plane and started following another plane toward <LOCATION> Linden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` I picked him up again and took him from there into <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Malawich </PERSON> said. The boy landed safely at <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> at 12:43 a.m. Sunday, with <PERSON> Malawich </PERSON> talking him through the landing. <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> police took him into custody and he he failed a Breathalyzer test, <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON> said. The plane was not damaged, <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said. The boy was released in his parents' custody and his case was turned over to juvenile authorities, who will decide whether to prosecute him on burglary and theft charges, <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> could press charges of its own.

<TEXT>
 A rail union leader Monday rejected a plan by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Guardian Angels group to set up patrols in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s subway system after two people were fatally stabbed and a third was wounded. `` Private individuals are indisciplined,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>, secretary of the 30,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Locomotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> and Firemen. He said police and rail staff should be increased. The latest victim of violence in the Underground was a 29-year-old man who was stabbed with a knife Sunday night during a fight at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Bridge station. He later had a kidney removed in an operation Monday. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION>, who operate in 70 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities, said they planned to visit <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to train British groups to begin patrolling the Underground next year. The government opposes the plan. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> and Transport Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> are to meet this week to discuss increasing violence on British subways and railroads. A Turkish visitor, <PERSON> Hakan </PERSON> <PERSON> Koseoglu </PERSON>, 17, was fatally stabbed Friday in <LOCATION> Holborn </LOCATION> station after he resisted two muggers who grabbed a gold chain from his neck. The two were tackled by two other passengers, but escaped. Six hours later, mechanic <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heron </PERSON>, 35, was stabbed at the <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> station during an argument as he stood in line for information. The assailant escaped and <PERSON> Heron </PERSON> died Saturday. Crime on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground has multiplied by 20 times since 1980. This year, 18,383 criminal incidents were reported, subway officials said.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> have agreed to join <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in suspending all low-level jet fighter training over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for the next three weeks, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced today. The suspension follows last week's fiery crash of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplane in the German city of <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION>, in which five people were killed and dozens injured. `` The suspension will remain in effect until Jan. 2, 1989, at which point fighter training will resume,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in releasing a joint communique from the four <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. The suspension, `` through the holiday season, -LRB- was agreed to -RRB- out of respect for the victims and the families of the victims of the <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION> accident, and for Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> USAF </ORGANIZATION>, and his family,'' the statement added. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Seal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was the pilot of the A-10 Thunderbolt II attack jet that crashed in <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION>, destroying two dozen homes. The accident occurred on Dec. 8 and immediately generated new demands in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for curbs on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> flights. The agreement to suspend fighter training until after New Year's was announced shortly after <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> held a closed-door meeting with his West German counterpart, Defense Minister <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON>, at the Pentagon Neither <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was available after the meeting to discuss the flight suspension. But <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials who asked not to be named said the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government had asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stop military aerial training until after the holidays. <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> previously had told reporters that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> had acceeded to his government's request.

 Bitter-cold Canadian air blanketed much of the nation Monday from the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to the South, contributing to at least three deaths as temperatures plunged to record lows in two dozen cities. The early deep freeze _ more than a week before the official onset of winter _ caused water pipes to burst, cars to die and homeless people to seek warmth in shelters. It also produced scattered power outages, record power demand and public-transit delays. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> McGarry </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said he experienced the subzero air fully with his sons on their morning paper route. `` It's unbelievable,'' <PERSON> McGarry </PERSON> said. `` They were dying.'' Weekend snow and ice were blamed for a dozen traffic fatalities in the nation's midsection. Snow was falling Monday over parts of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Snow was forecast for <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, a snow advisory was in effect for eastern <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, and wintry weather was expected in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>. The cold weather was caused by arctic air that flowed across <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and into the north-central and northeast <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowther </PERSON>, a meteorologist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Severe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION> `` About 25 cities reported record low temperatures this morning,'' he said Monday. Among them were <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, were thermometers dipped to 12 below zero; <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, 2 degrees; <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, 16 degrees; <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, 12 degrees; <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, 2 degrees; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, 2 below zero; <ORGANIZATION> Elkins </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, 10 below; <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, 3 below; <LOCATION> Houghton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, 12 below; <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, 6 degrees; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, 8 degrees; and <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, 8 degrees <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, tied its record for the date of 13 degrees. <LOCATION> Saranac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Placid </LOCATION>, had the coldest temperature in the nation Monday morning, 28 below zero. `` It gets colder than this _ sometimes 30 below,'' said resident <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRose </PERSON>, who said schools were open but village streets were quieter than usual. The bitter temperatures forced the homeless off the streets in many cities, agencies reported. `` We've filled every bed we have. It usually gets worse when the weather gets colder _ people who normally might not come here show up because they just ca n't bear the cold,'' said <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, assistant supervisor of the 113-bed <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, city workers and police tried to round up homeless people. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where the temperature dipped to a record-low 5 degrees, police took only four homeless people to shelters late Sunday and early Monday. Three came in voluntarily; a cold weather alert gave police the authority to move the fourth against her will, said a department spokesman, Sgt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. Two people in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> apparently did n't make it to a shelter. A homeless man was found Sunday on a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> street, apparently frozen to death, police said. His identity was not known. Also Sunday, a woman was found dead in an underpass of a subway station, and police said she may have died from a combination of a drug overdose and the cold. In <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, fire killed a woman in her 60s early Monday in a house where heat and electricity had been turned off. The woman apparently was using candles for heat and light, said Fire Capt. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>. Also Monday, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> police responding to an anonymous call found an infant wrapped in a trash bag outside a vacant house. The boy, believed to be two days to a week old, was reported in good condition at a hospital. `` He had not been there very long. He was warm to the touch,'' said a police spokeswoman, Agent <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>. Frozen switches slowed Philadelphia-area commuter trains, and frozen signals delayed the PATH train system that links northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delmarva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said high power demand hampered its efforts to restore power to about 10,000 customers after an equipment failure. The cold was a factor in scattered power outages affecting at least 2,900 customers in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pool </ORGANIZATION>, an association of 96 electric utilities, expected Monday's power useage to set a record. <ORGANIZATION> Niagara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mohawk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported a record-high winter power demand across <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, near-zero temperatures hampered crews trying to shut down a broken water main that closed a section of a busy artery for about three hours. Plows were called to clear about eight inches of slush formed by the thousands of gallons of water. In <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, burst pipes forced firefighters to pump water out of the first floor of the Legislative Office Building. In <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, where the mercury plunged to 8 below, people with car trouble were calling in record numbers to the <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said club president <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gertner </PERSON>. More than a foot of snow caused hundreds of weekend traffic accidents in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, leading to four deaths, authorities said. Wind whipped up to 2 inches of snow in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, causing hazardous driving conditions and several fatal accidents that left six dead. Two highway fatalities in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> on Sunday and Monday were blamed on icy roads.

<HEAD>State Wants To Revoke License Of Driver's Training School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELYRIA, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state has threatened to revoke the license of a drivers' training school that was investigated after a student driver was involved in a fatal accident in January, officials said Monday. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Highway Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Denihan </PERSON> notified <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keesee </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Pro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Driving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elyria </ORGANIZATION>, that he plans to revoke his license as a driver training instructor and the license of the company as a school. <PERSON> Keesee </PERSON> has 30 days to request a hearing on the state's contention that the school violated three parts of the <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drivers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Rules that are part of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Administrative Code, <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweiger </PERSON> said. Pro Driving School's attorney, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, said there was no basis for the allegations and said the school would request a hearing. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Elyria </LOCATION> was acquitted of a misdemeanor charge of vehicular homicide in September in the Jan. 23 death of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussey </PERSON>. During her second day of class at Pro Driving School, Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, then 17, skidded her car into a car carrying <PERSON> Mussey </PERSON>. An instructor was sitting next to her at the time. The state notified <PERSON> Keesee </PERSON> of its decision last week after the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> turned up the alleged violations in an investigation of the crash. `` They are the rules which require that beginning drivers shall not be given behind-the-wheel training until after they have had two hours of classroom instruction,'' Ms. <PERSON> Schweiger </PERSON> said. The school also is accused of violating a rule outlining the subject matter to be covered in theoretical instruction and a record-keeping rule. The judge who acquitted Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the teen-ager was poorly trained and criticized the school for showing the R-rated, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> movie `` <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> Dancer Your Life is Calling'' during the girl's first class The movie is loosely based on the comedian's life, particularly events following a 1980 incident in which he set himself on fire while smoking cocaine.

<HEAD>Green River TV Show Leads To Arrest Of Two In Separate Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENT, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A television special on the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> serial killings has led to the arrests of two people in the murder of a woman whose body was found in the river, police said Monday. The killing, however, was believed to be unrelated to the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> police Sgt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said. Authorities on Saturday arrested <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 27, and a 17-year-old boy, whose name was withheld, in the Oct. 25 killing of <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecila </PERSON> <PERSON> Worthing </PERSON>, 25. Ms. <PERSON> Worthing </PERSON>'s body was found the next day in the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The arrests were made on the basis of a tip phoned in after last week's nationwide broadcast of `` Manhunt: A Chance to End the Nightmare,'' which chronicled police efforts to capture the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killer. The Green River killer is officially blamed for the deaths of as many as 48 young women, many of them prostitutes, between the summer of 1982 and early 1984. Forty are known dead and the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> blames the killer for the disappearances of eight women. The case takes its name from the river south of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> where the first five victims were found in the summer of 1982. Although Ms. <PERSON> Worthing </PERSON>'s body was recovered from the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, her death is believed to be unrelated to the serial killings. Ms. <PERSON> Worthing </PERSON>, who had brushes with police in connection with drug and prostitution offenses, was last seen walking in the <LOCATION> Holly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said. Her body was found by fishermen. She had been asphyxiated. <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said he did not know what information was called in, and further details about the arrests were not immediately available. The telephone tip leading to the arrests was among more than 50,000 that have flooded investigators since the television show. `` They're still coming in as fast as we can take them,'' <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> detective <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said. He said it would be months before investigators finish checking out the tips.

<HEAD>Parents Showed Her How To Smoke Cocaine, Daughter Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A father charged with furnishing cocaine to his 17-year-old daughter said he `` wanted her to be exposed to it at home,'' police said Monday. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hupman </PERSON>, 36, and his wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, 34, were arrested Friday on four charges of furnishing cocaine to a minor after their daughter <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON>, a student at <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Altos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, told a school counselor her parents had a drug problem and were openly using cocaine. <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> first saw her parents using cocaine in 1986 and asked several months ago if she could try the drug, according to police. `` She made the inquiries. He offered, she accepted,'' Mountain View police officer <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindholm </PERSON> said. `` They did n't seek her out.'' She told authorities that her father showed her how to cook the powdered drug into potent, rock-like `` crack'' before smoking a pipeful with her. The high school student tried cocaine four times with her parents, including twice with crack, police said. The teen-ager last took cocaine the night her father took so much he got sick and thought he was suffering a heart attack, police said. `` She was frightened by what she saw and thought it was related to cocaine,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` She said she would never try it again.'' She was afraid the drug would kill her parents when she told the school counselor about their drug use, authorities said. The couple surrendered after police interviewed the five Hupman children, ages 6 to 17, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Police said there is no indication that any other children were exposed to cocaine at the home in <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION>, 45 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. A search of the family's apartment turned up no drugs or drug-related paraphernalia, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hupman </PERSON>, a printer at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, is scheduled to be arraigned Dec. 20. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hupman </PERSON>, a patient relations specialist at the university, is scheduled to be arraigned later. They were freed on $ 25,000 bail Saturday. If convicted, they face a maximum penalty of seven years in prison. The Hupman's children have been placed temporarily with <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hupman </PERSON>'s parents in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Although the teen-ager wanted her parents to get help, she also feared that reporting their drug use could break up the family, <PERSON> Lindholm </PERSON> said. State child abuse laws require school officials to relay reports of drug use to police. `` Her -LRB- <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON>'s -RRB- attitude was what has to be to be done has to be done,'' said <PERSON> Lindholm </PERSON>. `` As long as the family was going to get some help, it was OK.''

 Congested skies and damaged ground facilities contributed to the fatal crashes of two relief planes to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but night flights to the disaster scene will continue, a senior aviation official said Monday. Since Wednesday's devastating earthquake, more than 200 Soviet relief flights and 38 foreign flights have descended on airports at <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. They still are streaming to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, with more to come. Early Monday, all seven crew members aboard a <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> military transport were killed when their Soviet-built An-12 plane crashed and burned 7 -LCB- miles from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s Zvarnots airport. An Il-76 carrying Soviet soldiers to help rescue quake victims crashed near <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>'s airport before dawn Sunday, killing all 78 people on board, said <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Panyukov </PERSON>, deputy director of civil aviation. Snow, rain, and fog have forced air traffic controllers to divert planes to airports in the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Panyukov </PERSON> said that weather conditions were normal when the two planes made their approach. He said both disappeared from the radar just before they crashed. He provided no details on the reasons for either crash. `` We were obliged to interrupt flights -LRB- after the Yugoslav crash -RRB- for two hours ... but we do not see any reason to interrupt night flights,'' he said. `` The situation is difficult taking into account that the density of flights has increased dramatically,'' he said. The quake, which leveled buildings, also affected airport ground facilities. `` There was certain destruction in terms of the airports in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. Electricity and energy supplies were cut and there were difficulties with the airfields,'' he said. But he added that `` the airfields in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> now meet all standards for international air traffic.'' <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, an engineer with the airline <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION>, said an <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> aircraft clipped a parked <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 on Sunday. He said the accident occurred when the Soviet aircraft taxied behind the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> plane, which was bringing medical supplies to the stricken republic. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> flight later was able to return to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The situation at the <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> airport was `` unavoidably chaotic,'' <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said. Soviet newspapers contained graphic descriptions of the air congestion at the mountainous <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> airport. `` Airplanes were coming into <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> literally one after another,'' the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Referring to the two crashes, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said: `` How were these losses possible? Because in the air above <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> there was such confusion, just like on the ground.'' The military newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> made similar remarks Sunday before the crashes. `` The sky above <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> is overloaded,'' it said. `` There are always several planes in the air waiting to land. In these conditions precision is needed and strict coordination of operations.''

 A firebomb was hurled at an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> bus Monday in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the bus crashed into a wall and a parked car, injuring six people, including an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman, police said. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> confined 650,000 Palestinians to their homes with an indefinite curfew beginning at 9 p.m. <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> residents said the curfew might be intended to limit demonstrations during the speech Tuesday to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Libration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Shopkeepers in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> closed for a second day to mourn the deaths of two residents killed Saturday by army gunfire Saturday. At least 322 Palestinians have died in a year of rebellion against Israeli rule in the occupied territories, and 11 Israelis have been slain. Police fired tear gas on the grounds of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s holiest mosques after chasing Palestinian high school girls who threw stones, witnesses said. Three teen-age girls and a boy were reported arrested. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police searched for the bomb-thrower, believed to be a Palestinian. They closed <LOCATION> Saladin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s main commercial thoroughfare, where the attack occurred. `` The moment the bottle was thrown, the front windshield of the bus was covered in fire and smoke,'' said Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> Maod </PERSON> <PERSON> Halevi </PERSON>. `` The driver kept going until he slammed into a wall and a car nearby.'' Among the injured was <PERSON> Salwa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanana </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, who was seen lying in an ambulance wearing a neck brace. Hospital officials said five other passengers were slightly injured. <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadida </PERSON>, a Palestinian from <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> homeward bound on the bus, said: `` We thought the bus was going to turn over, then we managed to crawl out the back door.'' The stone-throwing in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> occurred on <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, venerated by both Moslems and Jews and known in Arabic as <PERSON> Haram </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharif </PERSON> -LRB- Noble Enclosuree -RRB-. In the complex are the silver-domed <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> and gold-topped Dome of the Rock mosques. Several hundred teen-age girls gathered in front of their religious high school on the grounds, chanting `` <PERSON> Allahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhbar </PERSON>!'' -LRB- `` God is great!'' -RRB- and throwing rocks at police, both officers and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> merchants reported. Riot police entered the complex and fired tear gas, said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that administers the two mosques. <PERSON> Haram </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharif </PERSON> is the third holiest site of Islam, after <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. `` Police shot four canisters inside the school and then they shot more and more'' but none of the gas entrered the mosques, <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> said. About 50 girls marched to the central bus station in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where they began throwing stones and were charged by mounted police. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer said girls fled into alleys around the station, pursued by mounted police swinging clubs, and a girl of about 16 tried to pull one of the officers off his horse. Soldiers shot and wounded a 22-year-old Palestinian during a raid on <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> village in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, said doctors at <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Troopers began shooting after they were stoned by villagers who resisted orders to paint over pro-PLO slogans. The army said it had discovered several Palestinian squads that belonged to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla faction and were suspected of attacks on soldiers and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians. A military spokesman said the squads were responsible for a knife attack on two young Israelis in a <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb in September 1987 and for planting three bombs aimed at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> patrols in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> el-Balah refugee camp

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the states are not enforcing water pollution regulations against 150,000 drinking water sources serving 36 million travelers, workers, students and others drinking water outside the home, according to an internal <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> report released Monday by a conservation group. Among these sources are those aboard trains, buses and airplanes, the report said. The group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, said it planned to sue the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> over deficiencies in enforcement of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The federation said it gave <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> the required 60-day notice of such suits on Monday. Such a suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> would seek an order requiring <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to perform duties spelled out in the act, said the federation's water specialist, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> The federation released an agency audit of so-called non-community systems carried out by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general. The inspector general in 1986 and 1987 checked water enforcement programs in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> where an estimated 3 million people were using those systems. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said in the report they believed those four states were representative of the nation, which has 150,000 non-community water sources serving 36 million people. `` State personnel in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> estimated that 40 percent of their -LRB- non-community systems -RRB- were out of compliance,'' the report said. `` The numbers were similar for <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> _ 40 percent in fiscal year 1986 and 29 percent in fiscal year 1987. The Federal Reporting Data System indicated only 7 percent of the -LRB- non-community systems -RRB- in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> had monitoring violations in fiscal year 1987. However, our review revealed that these numbers were substantuially understated.'' For coliform bacteria, to be checked every three months unless otherwise specified by the state, the report said: `` The state of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> estimated that 90 percent of the -LRB- non-community systems -RRB- did not comply with federal testing requirements.'' In the document, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said the shortcomings were `` a direct function of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s long-standing policy to place priority on assuring compliance by community water systems.'' Non-community systems have looser testing requirements than community systems, but even those were being ignored, the report said. In 1971-1985, the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> was able to trace to non-community water systems 45 percent of 484 outbreaks of diseases carried by drinking water. An <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment on the report Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> comments in the document said the agency planned priority attention in the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1 for the 20,000 non-community systems serving groups other than travelers, and `` will also consider'' requiring state and regional <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> offices to meet quotas for enforcement actions. A non-community system might be a single well serving a school, factory, restaurant, motel or campground. More generally, it is any system serving transients or non-residents, including supplies on buses, trains and planes even though those might get their water from public systems. Suppliers are supposed to post public notices when testing discloses a violation of standards, but `` We found only 11 of 826 monitoring violations had evidence of public notification in the file,'' the auditors wrote. `` State personnel admit that follow-up on public notification requirements is inadequate.'' In some violations, repeat testing is required to ensure that a standard is being met. Out of 145 violations of concentration standards that were checked, repeat sampling was required in 98, but `` only in two instances did the supplier initiate check sampling within the required 24 hours. We found no evidence of any check sampling at all for 28 of the 98 violations. ... In the remaining 68 instances, the supplier delayed the initiation of the check sampling process for periods ranging from two to 37 days,'' the report said. <LOCATION> Pennyslvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> issued notices of violations to suppliers in only 173 cases out of 371 cases in which notices should have been issued, and 56 percent of the notices were issued two months or more after the end of the quarter in which the violation occurred, the report said. <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> were not reporting what enforcement actions they took, but the auditors found only seven notices to suppliers out of 600 violations. The states have primary responsiblity for enforcing the federal law except <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, where EPA is directly responsible. In addition, the agency is directly responsible for enforcement on Indian reservations and in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Ishaq Khan Elected President; Bhutto Wins Confidence Vote</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> easily won his first full five-year term on Monday, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> won her first parliamentary vote of confidence. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> told legislators after her <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won 148-55 that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s destiny does not belong to any one party. `` It is the destiny of the entire people of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Each one of us has to shoulder the responsibility,'' she said. Earlier, right-wing lawmaker <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaheer </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> tried to block the confidence vote by saying the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> taught that a woman could not rule Moslems. A few minutes later, nearly 73 percent of his colleagues approved Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s leadership. Her party emerged as the largest single party Nov. 16 in the country's first free elections in more than a decade. But with 105 seats, it fell short of an outright majority in the 237-seat legislature. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, 35, since has gained support from several independents and minor parties, which entitled her to become the first female prime minister in the Moslem world. Under the constitution, the governing party has to pass a vote of confidence in parliament within 60 days of forming a government. Federal Election Commissioner S.A. Nusrat announced on television that <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, swept 78 percent of presidential votes cast by an electoral college of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and four provincial assemblies. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s party and the right-wing opposition alliance, headed by the <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, both supported <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> among the four presidential candidates, guaranteeing his victory. Of 446 valid votes, <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> polled 348 compared with 91 to his nearest rival, veteran politician <PERSON> Nawabzada </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nusrat </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, 78, credited with guiding <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> back to democracy after 11 years of autocratic rule, is to take the oath of office Tuesday. For the last eight years, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was ruled under martial law by President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, who died in an Aug. 17 plane crash that investigators said was probably caused by sabotage. Because he was <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chairman, the presidency passed to <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, who has nearly 40 years of experience in senior administrative posts, six of them as finance and commerce minister. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s president holds a largely ceremonial post, but the roles of both president and prime minister are under debate. A 1985 constitutional amendment authored by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> gives the president broad but vague discretionary powers. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> has called for a repeal of that amendment, which would restore supreme political powers to the prime minister as they existed during her father's 1970s government. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ousted <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> in 1977 and had him executed two years later for allegedly plotting to overthrow a political foe.

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said Monday the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> has until Jan. 31 to reach a new contract with 2,000 union members in three states, or face a strike. `` We want to go the last step, the last mile, to see if an agreement can be reached,'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said at a news conference called to announce the start of a media campaign to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate. `` But this is one union that has never run from a fight, and we're prepared to fight this one.'' But <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthis </PERSON>, who has said the company will continue to operate if the union strikes, said Monday he does not expect talks to resume soon. `` We think it would be most unfortunate if the union would carry through with this,'' <PERSON> Matthis </PERSON> said. `` It would create a lot of hardship in some of these communities.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> miners in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> have been working without a contract for 11 months, since the 1984 national coal contract expired last Jan. 31. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said there have been no negotiations since Nov. 9, when <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> gave the union `` a take-it-or-leave-it offer.'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said the company's offer would weaken safety rights, eliminate the eight-hour day, increase health care costs and give the company control of the pension plan. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> dropped out of the national coal industry bargaining organization before negotiations began for the 1988 agreement, saying the company's needs were different than those of the rest of the industry. The union contends <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> has demonstrated no interest in reaching an agreement. <PERSON> Matthis </PERSON> said his company's latest offer is better than the contract the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> recently signed with <ORGANIZATION> A.T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, ending a bitter conflict that began in 1984. The campaign announced by the union on Monday will `` increase pressure against the company on all fronts,'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> is urging other unions and their supporters to withdraw funds from banks lending money to <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>.

 The mayors of six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities named after biblical sites toured the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Monday to get a closer look at the Palestinian uprising. `` My problems are nothing like this,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggert </PERSON>, the mayor of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, after touring a Palestinian refugee camp. `` I do n't have to deal with rocks, bottles and rubber bullets.'' <PERSON> Eggert </PERSON> and five other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mayors visited the Deheisheh refugee camp outside <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> as part of a tour of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The visit is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-Palestinian organization based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eggert </PERSON> said the mayors came to learn more about the communities in the occupied territories, where Arabs have been staging a yearlong uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, the alderman once considered the strongest white mayoral candidate, quit the contest Monday and threw his support behind fellow Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s entry into the race a week ago doomed <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s chances, particularly among white ethnic voters, the source of both men's strongest support `` I can read the cards as well as anyone else,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. `` I said I would not continue in this race if all indications did not point to a successful result for me. They do not at this time.'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> made the announcement after recent polls showed <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney and son of legendary <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, leading the field. He said he was joining <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s campaign because `` of the remaining candidates, he's the one who has the best chance of winning.'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, 44, former chairman for the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was a leader of council opposition to Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, the city's first black mayor who died in office a year ago. A special mayoral election will be held April 4.

Health</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most family doctors are inadequately trained to recognize and treat illness that stems from unhealthy environments at home or work, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> panel said Monday. But rather than criticizing individual physicians, the report from the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> committee said the fault lies with `` our highly sophisticated health care system'' in general because it is not geared toward preventive medicine. `` Lacking a solid foundation in occupational and environmental medicine, as well as in the related disciplines of epidemiology and toxicology, most primary care physicians are hard-pressed to keep up with developments in the field,'' the report said. `` Indeed, the general medical literature contains relatively little about occupational and environmental medicine.'' To counter that, the panel's most urgent recommendation was for establishment of a clearinghouse for doctors to call `` when confronted with a patient suspected of having an occupational or environmental disease.'' `` It should be designed so that a single telephone call satisfies the practitioner's informational needs,'' the report said. `` It could be based on an extension of the techniques used by the nation's poison control centers.'' The Institute of Medicine, a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, is forming a new advisory committee specifically to draw up more detailed suggestions for such a clearinghouse. On a longer range, the panel that turned in its report Monday said physician fee schedules should be changed because `` the current procedure-oriented reimbursement system and the emphasis on efficiency of practice is antithetical to the desired emphasis on prevention.'' Eventually, the committee said, the focus must shift to medical schools, only half of which have a single faculty member `` primarily concerned with occupational health.'' `` Occupational and environmental medicine should be a vital part of the traditional student clinical assignments,'' the report said. `` Because preventative medicine is usually not taught in the clinical years, it is necessary that departments of clinical medicine include occupational and environmental medicine as part of their third - and fourth-year teaching programs. The report also called for more research into occupational and environmental medicine.

According to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> memo, <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON> had feuded when both were in federal prison. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> speculated that <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> had hoped to make peace with <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON> and forge an alliance that would aid his drive to regain power. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> listed <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON> as a soldier in the Genovese crime family who was a close associate of <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> in the early 1960s. The report also said <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON> and former <PERSON> Genovese </PERSON> family members were `` primary suspects in <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>'s disappearance.'' The Mafia Encyclopedia, written by <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sifakis </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON> was responsible for <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>'s disappearance. `` According to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> reconstruction of the <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> murder, ` Tony Pro' called the so-called peace parlay with <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> and then ordered him killed. <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON> denied even being in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> at the time, and seemed to go out of his way to seal an airtight alibi,'' the encyclopedia said. One of <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON>'s Teamster rivals, Local 560 dissident <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Casellito </PERSON>, was garroted with piano wire 23 years ago. The three <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON> brothers, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nunzio </PERSON>, all have been imprisoned for a variety of crimes, including racketeering and extortion. <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON> was installed shop steward in a trucking company in 1945, and by 1950 he was a <LOCATION> Teamster </LOCATION> organizer and eventually became president of Local 560. The encyclopedia said he presided over bookmaking, numbers and loan sharking run by his business agents and stop stewards. <PERSON> LaRoe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON> was sentenced to four years in prison by a judge in the federal court's Southern District in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on July 11, 1978, then on July 10, 1979, in the district of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to another 20 years. `` He had a tentative release date of Aug. 13, 1992, and had waived parole consideration,'' said LaRoe.

 Gunmen in a speeding car shot to death a British-born Belgian teacher as he walked through Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Monday, police said. They said no motive was apparent for the assassination of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Nieuwerburgh </PERSON>, 65, an English teacher at west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rashideen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Languages </ORGANIZATION> and the Moslem-controlled Makassed Cultural Center. His 17-year-old son, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, lifted a blood-stained towel covering his father's face, sobbed, and turned away. `` I am very shocked,'' he said later. Christian, who has two brothers and two sisters living outside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said his father had received no death threats. `` We are astonished. We do n't believe it is directed at Belgians,'' said Belgian charge d'affaires <PERSON> Guebert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bioul </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bioul </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nieuwerburgh </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> mother and Belgian father, and the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> confirmed the victim carried passports of both countries. Nieuwerburgh's Japanese wife, restaurateur <PERSON> Suyun </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsuchida </PERSON>, was abroad but expected to return Tuesday, <PERSON> Bioul </PERSON> said. The Belgian was the fifth Western educator to be assassinated in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in the last five years and the first since Syrian troops started policing the city in February 1987. Police said <PERSON> Nieuwerburgh </PERSON> was walking from school to his <LOCATION> Manara </LOCATION> district home when he was shot by assassins firing silencer-equipped pistols from a speeding car. `` Four bullets pierced his head. Death was instantaneous,'' said a police spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations. Witnesses told police they saw three gunmen in the orange <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> car the assassins used to escape. The vehicle had no license plates. `` He was such a nice man, such a good teacher,'' sobbed one of his students, who refused to give her name. Mrs. <PERSON> Nieuwerburgh </PERSON>'s business partner, <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyadjian </PERSON>, said the teacher had lived in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> since 1968, working first as an interpreter then switching to teaching in 1975. He spoke Japanese, French, English and Arabic. Friends said <PERSON> Nieuwerburgh </PERSON> tried to set up a memorial fund for two British teachers kidnapped and murdered in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1986. They were <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Padfield </PERSON>, 40, who was director of the privately owned <ORGANIZATION> Rashideen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, 34, a political science professor at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>. Sixteen kidnapped foreigners are believed held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>: nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian, a Belgian and a Swiss.

 Two Israeli air force planes with supplies for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s earthquake victims turned around and flew back home Monday because an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> already at their destination told them they were not needed, officials said. The civil defense commander, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vardi </PERSON>, radioed the pilots to return a few hours after takeoff so they could reorganize for a relief mission elsewhere in the area devastated by Wednesday's earthquake, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Vardi </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> on an earlier <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> relief flight. A military spokesman said on condition of anonymity that <PERSON> Vardi </PERSON> decided the planes `` could not be used effectively at the scene'' because their medical assistance was not needed in <LOCATION> Leninaken </LOCATION>, one of the hardest-hit cities in the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> republic. The planes were carrying relief supplies, medical teams and a field hospital. The military spokesman stressed that the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official, not the Soviet government, made the decision to order the U.S.-made Hercules airplanes back to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He said the aircraft were waiting at <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> for orders to return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was waiting for further instructions from Soviet authorities before sending the planes back, he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday called for the return of the remains of five Americans who were killed when their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government relief agency plane was downed in a missile attack over <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>. Department spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the `` tragic event'' underscored the importance of bringing a peaceful end to conflict in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>. The Soviet-armed <ORGANIZATION> Polisario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which has been fighting a guerrilla war since 1975 for control of the region, accepted responsibility for the downing last Thursday of a private DC-7 aircraft under contract to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. The Polisario also apologized and expressed regret. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> withheld judgment until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> questioned crew members of a second plane, which landed at <LOCATION> Sidi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ifni </LOCATION> after reportedly being hit by missiles. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the Americans' only mission was to eradicate locusts by sparying a pesticide. The planes had been leased from T & amp; G Aviation of <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiliamson </PERSON>, a special assistant to the AID, said last week they had no connection to any American intelligence operation `` Our must urgent priority at this time,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, `` is the recovery and return of the remains of our fellow citizens to their families in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We are in urgent consultation with all parties who might help in this effort.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the crash site was in a remote area of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> controlled by the Polisario. `` We do n't know, at this point, the exact circumstances.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. The guerrillas and the Moroccan government have been holding indirect peace talks under the sponsorship of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> appealed for cooperation in the effort.

<TEXT>
 Though the town's name evokes images of palm trees and sunny beaches, the 650 residents of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> shivered in air that hit 18 degrees below zero Monday, the coldest temperature in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. But townspeople say subzero temperatures are common in the mountainside community that sits 2,800 feet above sea level, just 500 feet below the state's highest peak, <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Greylock </LOCATION>. `` We're just used to coping with stuff like that,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Selectmen </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not unusual for us to have snow banks taller than cars. `` When <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> gets three or four inches of snow, everybody panics, nobody can move. We get a couple of inches daily,'' <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> boasted. `` That's nothing for us.'' He said the town in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' northwest corner probably was named after the southern state because <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> `` had a magical sound to it.'' `` Probably because of <LOCATION> Ponce </LOCATION> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> and the fountain of youth,'' he said, adding there also are Floridas in neighboring <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Einar </PERSON> <PERSON> Oleson </PERSON>, a former town clerk and member of the local historical society, also believes the town was been named in honor of the state, which the nation was considering buying from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> at the time of the town's incorporation in 1805. Another theory has it that the town was named for the wild azaleas, called floribunda, that once covered the mountain on which the community sits, she said. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> said he rarely hears jokes about the town's moniker, but a photograph several years ago of a resident holding a snow shovel and standing next to the frozen highway sign bearing the town's name was published in several newspapers in the southern state.

<TEXT>
 U.S.-backed Moslem rebels on Monday claimed they shot down an Afghan military aircraft, but <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s official radio gave a different account and said a passenger plane was shot down with all 25 people aboard killed. Official Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> charged that a <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> air force plane on Saturday shot down a Soviet-made Antonov-26 airliner as it was heading toward <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the capital, from the eastern city of <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, 18 miles from the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border. Pakistani officials denied the allegation. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabir </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION> rebel group, said guerrillas brought down a military transport plane on Saturday with a sophisticated, U.S.-supplied anti-aircraft missile. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the rebels, known as mujahedeen, or holy warriors, presumably were referring to the same incident. `` We only know that some government officials and other military officers were on the plane,'' <PERSON> Kabir </PERSON> said, dismissing Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> claims. `` <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> is under siege by mujahedeen and only military planes go there. He said his guerrilla organization probably was the one involved because it is the strongest in the area and has most of the Stinger missiles. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which signed a U.N.-brokered accord in April providing for the withdrawal of more than 100,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, often accuse each other of air and missile attacks. Afghan guerrillas based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have been fighting <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s communist government for 10 years On Nov. 21, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of shooting down a commercial plane that strayed into Pakistani airspace, killing all 27 people aboard. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> acknowledged the incident, but identified the plane as a military transport. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s air force has standing orders to shoot down intruding Afghan military planes. Also on Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said authorities responded to Turkish appeals and freed two Turks jailed for entering <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> illegally with rebels. It said <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Osul </PERSON> and Ottoman Dimirial were released on Sunday. <PERSON> Osul </PERSON> was arrested four years ago and sentenced to 16 years. <PERSON> Dimirial </PERSON> was arrested this year and sentenced to 20 years, the radio said.

 The 1988 cotton crop is expected to be at a seven-year high of 15.2 million bales, up 3 percent from last year's harvest and 2 percent more than forecast a month ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday In a new estimate based on field conditions as of Dec. 1, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said this year's cotton production would be the largest since 15.6 million bales were harvested in 1981. The report also indicated dry edible bean production this year at 19.1 million hundredweight, down 26 percent from last year, and burley tobacco production at 459 million pounds, up 9 percent from the 1987 harvest. Orange production, at 215 million boxes, is up 9 percent from last season but about 1 percent shy of 1987-88 production. The report did not include new 1988 production figures for other major crops such as wheat, corn and soybeans. An annual report on this year's producton of those commodities will be issued Jan. 13. Planting of winter wheat for the 1989 harvest was 95 percent completed by Nov. 1, about 5 percentage points ahead of average, the report said. But lack of moisture hampered development in much of the major growing areas. `` Near the end of the month, rain and snow provided needed moisture in portions of the plains and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>,'' the report said. `` Greenbugs continued to be a problem in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Kellogg Takes Tropical Oil Out of Cracklin' Oat Bran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it has stopped using tropical oil in its Cracklin' Oat Bran cereal, eliminating an unwanted dose of saturated fat for consumers who buy the cereal for cholesterol-lowering bran. `` I'm elated,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savers </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> organization that has campaigned against products which use tropical oils, such as palm and coconut. `` Thousands of ounces of coconut oil will no longer be clogging the arteries of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' as a result of <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>'s action, he said. Oat bran helps keep down cholesterol, while saturated fat can boost it. People who have high levels of cholesterol run a higher risk of a clogging of the arteries that can lead to heart attacks. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, senior vice president for <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>'s corporate affairs, told <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> in a letter that the company was taking coconut oil out of the cereal. He said the new product will be on grocery shelves within three months. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said Monday that <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> had been working on a new formula for Cracklin' Oat Bran because the cereal maker sensed growing public sentiment against use of tropical oils. `` We do n't want to lose it -LRB- consumer confidence -RRB- over confusion about one product out of 40,'' he said, adding other Kellogg products do n't contain the tropical oils. <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> replaced the coconut oil in Cracklin' Oat Bran with a combination of cottonseed and soybean oils that eliminates the saturated fat content. In addition to <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> earlier said it was taking tropical oil out of its breads with plans for removing it from cookies, and <ORGANIZATION> Sunshine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biscuits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it was taking tropical oils out of its cookie products, <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> said coconut oil contains 100 percent more saturated fat than lard. Coconut and palm oil are popular because they contribute to the shelf life of food products, <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> said. Many products advertised as being free of cholesterol contain tropical oils that can help cholesterol form after consumption, he said. `` When they say ` No cholesterol' on a product ... it may be fine, but it may contain highly saturated palm and coconut oils,'' <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> said. National Heart Savers plans $ 140,000 worth of ads Tuesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and USA Today, citing other products it says are high in palm and coconut oils. The products to be cited Tuesday are <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triscuit </ORGANIZATION> crackers and striped Chips Ahoy cookies; <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Fibre cereal; <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goldfish </ORGANIZATION> crackers; <ORGANIZATION> Keebler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> crackers; Quaker Chewy Granola Bars; <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cremora </ORGANIZATION> creamer; <ORGANIZATION> Carnation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffeemate </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Birdseye </PERSON> Cool Whip topping; and <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisco </ORGANIZATION>. All but the granola bars and Chips Ahoy cookies were cited previously, <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> said. `` These are the ones that people eat and do n't realize what they're consuming,'' <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Charges should be filed against the `` scrap-builders'' of shoddily constructed buildings deatroyed by the earthquake that killed more than 50,000 people in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, Pravda said Monday. The Communist Party newspaper recommended the action in a scathing artlcle about apartment buildings in the devastated region that crumbled into `` concrete and metal graves over victims who were buried alive.'' `` In fragments of concrete panels, it is impossible to know whether there is more sand or more cement,'' it said of the wreckage in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, a city of 250,000 where more than three-quarters of the buildings fell. `` It is time to answer the question, how many criminal cases were filed against the scrap-builders and what was the outcome?'' Pravda asked. `` Who closed their eyes to the warnings of the seismologists, here and in other regions?'' All construction in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is handled by government agencies. American earthquake experts have said a quake of the same strength would have killed only 1,000 people in heavily populated <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> because of the difference in building techniques. Concrete-slab apartment buildings were hastily built throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the past 20 years to ease a chronic housing shortage. The Kremlin has sent a commission to <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> to determine why so many buildings disintegrated in an area where where builders supposedly used construction techniques designed to survive quakes. Authorities have said the temblor last Wednesday was stronger than expected in northwestern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Photos of the ruins show entire sections of high-rise residential buildings sheared off, with no evidence of steel reinforcing bars at stress points as required in Western countries. `` If the construction of the buildings was better, maybe less would have been destroyed,'' <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bibin </PERSON>, deputy chief of Soviet construction, told a news briefing Monday. A broken slab on which was writtren `` This piece of concrete is not to be used,'' lay in the rubble Monday in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>. Short supply is common in Soviet industry and workers often use the defective or makeshift to finish projects. <PERSON> Bibin </PERSON> said the earth shook vertically during the quake, causing buildings constructed of concrete slabs to collapse. He also said the earth was soft in some areas. `` Why did buildings from three years ago collapse while those of three or five stories built under -LRB- former leader <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> are still standing?'' President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> demanded on television Sunday night. In <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, older low-rise apartment blocks stood unscathed while `` everything built in the years of stagnation collapsed,'' Pravda said, using the Soviet term for the regime of the late <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. `` Geophysicists more than once warned builders of the high seismic activity in northwest <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but stubbornly they continued to raise five - to nine-story buildings,'' the paper said Acccording to <LOCATION> Bibin </LOCATION>, every building more than five stories high collapsed. <PERSON> Kagik </PERSON> <PERSON> Avakyan </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the city had no buildings taller than two stories until 20 years ago because of the threat of earthquakes.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s highest ranking counterterrorism official alleged on Monday that <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had direct involvement in 10 terror attacks in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and abroad. <PERSON> Yigal </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmon </PERSON>, special adviser on terrorism to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, told a news conference <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was involved through `` approval of plans, issuing orders and allocating the funds necessary for the special operations.'' `` There are other types of involvement, but I can not specify,'' he added. The 10 acts <PERSON> Carmon </PERSON> listed ranged from the July 1987 assassination in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> cartoonist <PERSON> Naji </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ali </PERSON>, known for his anti-Arafat drawings, to the April 1986 bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner over <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> which killed four people. <PERSON> Carmon </PERSON> gave no specifics and would not say how Israeli officials concluded <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was personally linked to the incidents.

Supporters included <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON>, a former senior aide to Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. It said that `` prospects of opening negotiations with this Palestinian leadership'' have been brought closer, but that `` without an unequivocal decision to renounce terror and stopping it, there will be no negotiations.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on Monday agreed to suspend all low-level military jet training over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for the next three weeks `` out of respect for the victims'' of a fiery crash last week. The suspension, requested by the West German government after the Dec. 8 accident at <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION>, will block military flight training below altitudes of roughly 10,700 feet. `` The suspension will remain in effect until Jan. 2, 1989, at which point fighter training will resume,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> added in releasing a joint communique from the four <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. In a related matter, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Monday denied newspaper reports that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers used force to keep local residents and a news reporter away from the scene of last week's crash The accident involved an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> A-10 Thunderbolt II jet that slammed into a residential neighborhood in <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION>, killing the pilot and five others on the ground and igniting a huge blaze that destroyed two dozen homes. Some West German officials have charged that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> authorities mishandled the rescue efforts and delayed releasing information. The suspension of low-level training, `` through the holiday season -LRB- was agreed to -RRB- out of respect for the victims and the families of the victims of the <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION> accident, and for Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> USAF </ORGANIZATION>, and his family,'' the communique stated. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Seal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was the pilot of the A-10. The accident immediately generated fresh demands in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for curbs on training flights by <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> air forces. The flight suspension was announced shortly after <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> met behind closed doors at the Pentagon with his West German counterpart, Defense Minister <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON>. Neither <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> were available after the meeting to discuss the matter. <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> previously had said that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> had agreed to his government's request. On any given day in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the sky is filled with hundreds of jets and helicopters, leading to public opposition that has been fueled by recent tragedies. Even before last week's fatal crash, 12 major accidents of military aircraft had killed 95 people this year alone. They included 70 who died from an air show crash in <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> in August. Allied military authorities ordered a temporary suspension of low-level training missions immediately after the <LOCATION> Remscheid </LOCATION> crash, only to see opposition West German political parties call for an outright ban on low-level flights and sharp cuts in air excercises. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition he not be named said there was a serious concern about honoring <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s request `` because we do n't want to set any big precedent and we do n't want to reduce our pilot proficiency standards.'' In the end, however, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials concluded they could not ignore a request from the West German government `` that was limited to a reasonable period of time,'' the source added. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, following <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON>'s departure, declined to elaborate publicly on the brief, two-sentence communique.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it has formally adopted a rule change that lets processors use certain acidic substances to keep supermarket pork chops looking pink and appetizing. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency has permitted use of the additives since September 1986 but also reserved making a final decision until public comments had been submitted. The substances are ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate and sodium citrate, which are used in fresh cuts of pork to maintain the meat's color. `` The use of these substances in the product does not pose a health risk,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. `` Fresh pork loses its color long before it becomes unsafe.

 A key congressman said Monday he wants an investigation into <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> computer contracts in the wake of a ruling by a federal appeals board that specifications for a series of contracts had favored <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` In the next two years, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will play an important role in the defense procurement question and with shrinking budgets, it is important that we get the most for our defense dollars,'' said Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <PERSON> D-N.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> is chairman of the Energy and Commerce consumer protection subcommittee. Speaking by telephone from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> office, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> said he has asked the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to investigate in the wake of last week's decision by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s board of contract appeals The board ruled in a case involving a $ 150 million computer contract. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> competitors had complained, charging that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s specifications for the contract unfairly favored the giant company In the ruling, Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contract `` solicitation provides for less than full and open competition and that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has not properly justified such a restriction on competition.'' Telephone calls seeking comment were not returned Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials. The case involves a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contract to purchase about 20 computer systems for 14 different data centers and facilities. The 10-year contract also includes training and technical support. The specifications were issued more than a year ago. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> argued that using a single contractor would have technical and administrative advantages and suggested that using more than one source would mean non-compatible computers. The protest to the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> board was filed by <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. of <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, one of the companies seeking to bid. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> said he wanted the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the congressional watchdog agency, `` to investigate the process under which the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has apparently violated federal procurement rules.''

 The creators of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, one of the hottest-selling Christmas toys, know what little boys want. `` Kids are into slime,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, a toy industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poors </ORGANIZATION>. `` Anything to gross out their little sisters.'' The four turtles wielding Ninja weapons have hit No. 11 in the Toy & amp; Hobby World charts of best sellers just four years after they were conceived by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON> during a late-evening diet of `` horrible'' television. `` It's insane,'' said <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON>, 26. `` <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> and I really had no idea what we were unleashing. We were just two wild-eyed kids who just wanted to do comic books.'' Eastman, then an occasional student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, said he tracked down <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>, who scraped out a living by drawing illustrations for local newspapers, in 1982 because their cartoons looked alike. The turtles were created after what <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON> called a heavy dose of `` T.J. Hooker'' and `` Love Boat'' at an apartment the two men shared while <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> was still free-lancing cartoons and Eastman got by making sandwiches at a restaurant. `` We had been watching a bunch of horrible TV and we started drawing and throwing the stuff at each other,'' Eastman said last week. `` We found we had this little beastie that we really fell in love with.'' The beast soon had three brothers, all named after Renaissance artists, and a weird history involving a pool of goo in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> sewer and a rat with the powers of a Ninja master. Their creators scraped together $ 1,200 and printed 3,000 copies of the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic book. The comics sold out in three weeks and <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donatello </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> were propelled to fame on T-shirts, cereal boxes and Saturday morning TV. Even avid fan <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> was filmed reading a turtles comic in the farewell episode of `` Magnum, P.I.''

 Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, who got his start in politics as an aide to <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, was named Monday to take the vice president-elect's seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` I believe in providence,'' said Coats, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Republican who had succeeded his boss in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> eight years earlier when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> moved up to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Coats, 45, had won re-election to a fifth House term on Nov. 8, the same day <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> won the vice presidency as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> announced Coats' name at a news conference in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, saying he `` represents values near and dear to the people of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, appearing with Coats on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, praised the Republican congressman as a dedicated family man and trusted friend. But he turned aside suggestions that Coats was his hand-picked successor. `` This was a one-man vote. The governor made the decision. ... I did not make any specific recommendation,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. Coats thanked <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s senior senator, Republican <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, for their support and promised great efforts on behalf of his <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> constituents. `` I realize I'm not their elected senator. I'm their appointed senator. I hope over the next two years to work my very hardest to earn their respect and support,'' he said. He will serve until a special election in 1990, when voters will decide whether he or someone else should fill the last two years of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s term. An election for a full six-year <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> term will be in 1992. In response to a reporter's question about the coincidence of twice following <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> into elected posts, Coats replied, `` I believe in providence, rather than fate. However that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat was a hotly contested seat in 1980 ... I hope that I earned that seat in 1980 and in the subsequent eight years demonstrated my ability to do the job.'' He had worked in <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s congressional office in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, from 1976 to 1980. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said Coats had `` the ability, the intellect, the character and the temperament to be an outstanding <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> senator,'' a thought echoed by <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>. `` He is a remarkable legislator, a remarkable campaigner, but even more importantly, a decent human being,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> issued a statement welcoming Coats to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and saying he was confident Coats would `` continue to represent the people of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> with vigor and commmitment to their heartland values.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the low-key Coats has compiled a conservative record that drew an 82 percent approval rating in 1986 from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. He is a supporter of aid to the Nicaraguan Contras and to the Angolan rebels. In 1984, he attempted to attach to an education bill an amendment to cut off federal aid to schools and states banning voluntary school prayer. The amendment was defeated. In selecting Coats, <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> cited his `` very fine electoral record'' in five House elections and an ability to build a strong base to withstand a Democratic challenge. Coats has never received less than 61 percent of the vote in his northeastern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> district. Last month he won re-election with 62 percent. His selection makes no change in the Democratic-Republican split in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has announced he will resign, probably effective Jan. 2, to allow his successor to gain seniority by being sworn in before the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 3. However, <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> said he expected to be sworn in with the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Several other names had been mentioned as potential candidates for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s seat, including former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> political director <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>. Both took themselves out of contention several weeks ago. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said his wife was `` very gratified'' with <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>'s decision. Coats was born in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and then served in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Like <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, he got his law degree at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. He worked as assistant vice president and legal counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> before going to work for then-Rep. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>

 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> chose his predecessor's treasury secretary as ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday, another sign of his desire to alter the terms of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s huge foreign debt An announcement from the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Petriccioli </PERSON>, who has a master's degree in economics from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, will replace <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> los </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, who began his six-year term Dec. 1, has said renegotiating terms of the $ 102 billion foreign debt leads his priority list, and he discussed it with President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at their meeting in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> last month. As Treasury Secretary for the last two years of de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s term, <PERSON> Petriccioli </PERSON> sought a postponement of debt payments because of the financial squeeze caused by the collapse of world oil prices in the early 1980s He negotiated an an agreement with creditor banks signed March 21, 1987, that included $ 7.7 billion in new loans, restructured $ 43.7 billion of the debt and decreased interest rates on $ 8.6 billion loaned in 1983-84. <PERSON> Petriccioli </PERSON>, 60, also worked out <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s purchase of several billion dollars worth of its foreign debt certificates at discount rates this year and helped enforce a `` solidarity pact'' of government, business and labor that helped lower annual inflation from 150.9 percent in 1987 to about 48 percent in 1988. By keeping interest rates high and the peso's value virtually steady against the dollar, <PERSON> Petriccioli </PERSON> also managed to accumulate an all-time record of $ 16 billion in foreign currency reserves last year. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has promised to lighten the burden of austerity economics on average Mexicans, whose real wages have been cut in half during the past six years. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has noted <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s economic growth remained near zero during that period and said renegotiating debt payments is vital to provide money for industrial development. Foreign creditors have balked at <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s proposals to reduce the $ 13 billion it is paying in debt service this year. Debt service payments for next year are estimated at $ 16 billion.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration renewed its offer Monday of a `` substantive dialogue'' if <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, explictly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renounced terrorism. The offer was made by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on the eve of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s arrival in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> debate on the conflict between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> The session was shifted to the Swiss city after Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> blocked a visa for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to speak in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> cited the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s terrorism record and called <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> an `` accessory.'' He invoked a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law denying entry to terrorists as superseding a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to facilitate travel for foreigners to attend <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sessions. At the same time, though, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> participation in any <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks essential. He also invited <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to agree to three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> requirements that must be met before the administration will hold diplomatic talks. These are: acceptance of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 242 and 338, adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in 1967 and 1973; recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist; and renunciation of terrorism. The two resolutions implicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist within secure boundaries. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the legislative arm of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, last month approved holding <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> negotiations within the framework of the resolutions but did not accept the resolutions directly. In another move, the council edged away from advocating terrorism, but <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, who directs the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s office of counterterrorism, said it did not amount to renouncing terrorism <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> referred to a reaffirmation of Palestinians' right `` to resist the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of their land in any way possible.'' And the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> group did not directly recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We've put forward some very clear-cut requirements, which are necessary to satisfy to enter into a substantive dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said. `` We look forward to the day when they'll do that, step up to bat.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official called the three requirements `` a set of criteria'' and said `` when those criteria are satisfied ... when those conditions are met, we are prepared to engage in a substantive dialogue.'' Still, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> left unclear whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would immediately deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> if <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> met the three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` I do n't want to predict what will happen,'' he said. `` We have to make a judgment when and if those three things are addressed. That judgment I ca n't make in the abstract.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> has not changed, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. The main aim is direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION>, including Palestinians, on an overall peace settlement. Holding an international peace conference as a backdrop for such talks would be considered, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, would represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> debate.

<HEAD>Witness Now Says He Lied About Child-Poisoning Confession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARCADIA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The last surviving witness to the alleged jailhouse confession of a farmworker in the poisoning of his seven children more than 20 years ago has recanted his testimony, a newspaper reported Monday. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was convicted for one of the 1967 killings and sentenced to life, accused of putting the deadly insecticide parathion in a lunch a baby sitter served his children, age 2 to 8. Now, a cellmate who testified to a jailhouse confession says it never happened, The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. `` I did n't hear <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> say anything while I was in there,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, 67, told the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>, a statement he later repeated to The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper said. `` I ai n't never heard the boy say anything about it. I hope <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> will get out. I want him to get out.'' <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> did not explain to state investigators or the newspaper why he may have lied at the trial, saying he could not recall the details of his testimony. The admission may lend additional impetus to a movement to spring <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> from prison. The department of law enforcement, already investigating the case at the request of Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, is expected to submit its final report to the governor this week. `` We are examining it now, and have been for the past number of weeks and the governor is actively considering reviewing it on a more formal basis,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s director of operations, said Monday. He noted that the governor can call for a clemency hearing. `` He has n't made that decision yet. He will be briefed on it probably this week.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s lawyers had said earlier they plan to file a petition for a new trial Thursday. `` I think this <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> thing is going to put the icing on the cake,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>, who defended <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> at trial and initially appealed the case, said Monday. Some of the most damaging testimony against <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> at his 1968 trial came from <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> and another felon, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuningham </PERSON>, both of whom alleged that the 32-year-old fruit picker had remorsefully and repeatedly confessed in his cell while awaiting trial. A third convict died before trial, but his similar account was read into the record. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> was shot to death in 1979. No one has been arrested in that case. <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>'s recantation is the latest in a series of developments to cast doubt on <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s conviction, his lawyers say. The first came earlier this year when it was reported that the former baby sitter, <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, now 67, told nurses in a nursing home in 1985 that she had poisoned the children. And last week, <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>'s former chief of police, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, swore he believes <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was `` framed'' by then-DeSoto County Sheriff <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> were `` handpicked'' informants testifying in return for lenient sentences. They `` would have done or said anything that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> asked them to do, including making false statements under oath.'' <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>'s allegation. And prosecutors say the baby sitter, who is immobile and has lapsed into utter silence, became confused over the years because she had innocently served a poisoned meal. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s new attorneys, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said they will file an appeal to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and to the trial court, charging that the state knowingly used perjured testimony. `` I want a jury to hear that he was framed, and to bring out the perjury on the record,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, now 52, is at the <ORGANIZATION> Tomoka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, where he will be eligible for parole in 1993.

The letter, written by Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and signed by 65 colleagues, said the course, `` Facing Ourselves and History,'' has been taught by 1,000 teachers, has rated at or near the top of its application category and received strong recommendations for approval from Education Department staff aides. Despite these factors, the letter said, money for the program was denied in 1986, 1987 and 1988, at least partially on the basis of biased peer reviews. One concluded that `` the Nazi point of view, however unpopular, is still a point of view and is not presented, nor is that of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>.'' The official who denied the funding, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>, was removed from her job two days before <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>' Government Operations subcommittee on human resources held a hearing on the matter in October. The bipartisan group of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members said all evidence indicates `` Facing History'' is an excellent program and should be distributed to all schools that want to use it. They asked <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> to review the department's past actions and use his discretionary authority to release money for it.

<HEAD>Hirohito's Condition Unstable, Bleeding Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Doctors reported Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s condition was unstable Monday as he continued to bleed internally and his blood pressure fluctuated, palace officials said. The 87-year-old monarch received a transfusion of nearly a pint, which helped raise his systolic blood pressure to 104, up from 71 in the morning, <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said. The average reading is about 120. `` His condition can not be described as stable,'' <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> quoted doctors as saying <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, who has been bedridden since he started to bleed from his intestine Sept. 19, lost considerable amounts of blood last week. Doctors have said an intestinal blockage has forced some of the blood into the abdomen. A palace official said on condition of anonymity that doctors were draining the blood from <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s abdomen `` because there is the fear that his breathing could be affected by the -LRB- buildup of blood -RRB-.'' `` The functioning of each internal organ has more or less declined in the wake of the bleeding'' last week, <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> told reporters. The emperor slept most of the day Monday, but he at times has shown signs of consciousness, <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said. Media reports said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was in a semi-coma. `` His overall condition is gradually weakening, but there has been no sudden change,'' said the palace official. The emperor has no political power but serves as a symbol of the unity of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is denying refugee status to large numbers of Soviet Jews at the main American processing point for Soviet emigres, Jewish officials say. The <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> center has refused 201 refugees in the past three months, said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, European director for the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration officials blame a sharp jump in the number of Soviet Jews permitted to leave their country _ more than the Soviet refugee slots set by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Their rejections have stunned Soviet Jews who are being temporarily housed in the seaside town of <LOCATION> Ladispoli </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. `` It's awful. We are all in shock,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Shpaeyr </PERSON>, 31, a biologist who came from <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> this fall with his wife and two children. The overwhelming number of Soviet Jews still are granted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refugee status, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Jewish officials say. And those rejected may appeal or apply for public interest parole. The latter program differs from the refugee program in that emigrants must pay their own transport to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, can not claim welfare and must be sponsored by a relative or friend. Most Soviet Jews do not want the parole, since it does not allow them to become <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens or permanent residents, said <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>. The Jews also can move to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said Soviet Jews used to get refugee status almost automatically. `` Now there are more people than funded positions,'' he said on condition of anonymity. `` You're going to take those who ... present the best cases of persecution. You're going to take those in a more precarious position.'' <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberman </PERSON>, 29, an engineer from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> who came to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in September with his mother, argues Jews still are attacked. `` We were afraid for our lives,'' he said. Like most rejected Jews, <PERSON> Liberman </PERSON> is appealing his case. `` It seems strange for all the refuseniks,'' he said. `` We do n't understand what is the difference between us and those who got refugee status All of us suffered persecution because we were Jews.'' <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> also said the rejections seemed arbitrary. `` That's possible,'' the immigration spokesman said. `` But previously we were not faced with having more applicants than slots available.'' <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> said the number of Soviet emigrants arriving in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> grew from 2,700 in November to 1,500 in the first two weeks of December alone. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has agreed to accept 24,500 refugees from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in fiscal 1989, which began on Oct. 1. Although the number is higher than last year's 18,000 slots, it apparently will not meet demand. The 3,000 slots designated for Soviet refugees in the first quarter of the year were filled by Oct. 31, the immigration spokesman said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday denounced the kidnappers of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> for a `` grotesque'' assertion that he had been tried and sentenced to death. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> also dismissed their accusation that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> had spied for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as `` nonsense.'' She said the kidnappers would be held `` fully responsible'' for the American officer's safety and welfare. The pro-Iranian group holding <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said in a statement in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that he would be executed. `` The spy has been turned over to those responsible for executing this just and revolutionary verdict,'' said the statement delivered to the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper An-Nahar. A photocopy of a photograph purporting to show <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> in a dark sweater was pasted to the bottom of the 15-line statement. Captors of foreigners in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> usually provide a photograph to authenticate their statements. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was head of a 76-man observer group attached to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> when he was kidnapped near the southern port city of Tyre on Feb. 17. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, in behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, called upon the hostage-takers `` and those with influence over them to release immediately and unconditionally Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and all other hostages in accordance with universal humanitarian obligations.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> records, nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and a Belgian are held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said `` the notion that kidnappers have the right to try their victims is grotesque. The rendering a judgment of those who have committed a criminal act is a perversion of civilized concepts of justice. The so-called trial and outcome represent a cyncial attempt to exploit toe holding of hostages, particularly during the Christmas seasnon.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement added: `` The charge that Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is a spy is nonsense.'' It also noted that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which had just won the Nobel Peace Prize when he was abducted.

 To succor the wretched of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s earthquake, each did what he could Monday: <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> sent dogs to sniff out the trapped, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> sent tea to warm the chilled, and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> millionaire personally delivered a $ 1 million check. Sometimes, their efforts went heartbreakingly awry. Before dawn Monday, a <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> military plane crashed while trying to land at <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> airport with medical supplies. All seven crewmembers aboard were killed, officials said. It was the second crash of a relief aircraft in two days. On Sunday, a Soviet military transport plane went down near <LOCATION> Leninaken </LOCATION>'s airport, killing 78 people Despite Monday's new disaster, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> was preparing to send another plane soon to help the victims of Wednesday's quake, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, two dogs, their handlers and an official from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Dogs Organized for Ground Search planned to take a flight Monday to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, pick up doctors and medical supplies there, and fly on to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. `` The dogs that are over there are wearing out and they need fresh dogs,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramseur </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, officials said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> private and public donations to Soviet earthquake relief efforts reached $ 3.2 million Monday. First Lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said she and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> planned on making their own contribution. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the total international relief effort as of Monday was $ 26.1 million. Officials said <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> and a frequent visitor to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, hand-delivered a $ 1 million check to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The international drive has mobilized an estimated 40 countries, which have contributed help in the form of doctors, medicine, food, blankets, tents, and heavy equipment to move debris. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Voznesensky </PERSON> said 38 relief planes have arrived from abroad. He and other officials said 923 specialists from abroad with 216 search dogs were working in the disaster area. In <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> arap </PERSON> <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> said Monday that his country will donate tea leaves for the victims. He did not say how much. `` We in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> ca n't do much to help the victims of the earthquake,'' he said. `` But we will send them some tea to drink. It is very cold there.'' Sometimes, the international efforts lacked coordination. Two Israeli air force planes with supplies for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s victims turned around and flew back home Monday because an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> already at their destination told them they were not needed there, officials said. They were in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> awaiting a new relief assignment elsewhere in the region. The reports of the devastation continued to touch people's heart around the world, especially those of ethnic Armenians. The Armenian community on the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> donated money, food and clothing Monday. Officials said about $ 50,000 had been collected. An Armenian priest tearfully embraced an 8-year-old boy as he dropped the equivalent of $ 20 from his piggy bank on the priest's desk <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> relief organization said it planned to send relief supplies, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. It was believed to be the first time <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has offered emergency help to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a former ally with whom political relations have been strained for nearly three decades. Other communist and socialist nations, including <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, rushed to send help, reports said. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> will send 20 helicopters to help with relief efforts, a foreign ministry official in <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> said Monday. The quake also shook <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s eastern province of <LOCATION> Kars </LOCATION> on the Soviet border, killing four and leveling 200 homes. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s efforts to help Armenians also come against a backdrop of longstanding hatred between the two peoples. Many Armenians still blame <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> for a genocide in 1915 that is said to have killed 1.5 million Armenians.

<HEAD>DOE Plan Envisions Concentrating Nuclear Weapons Making Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A forthcoming report on renovation of the nation's nuclear weapons plants envisions concentrating most facilities in three `` theme parks,'' sources familiar with the document said Monday. The classified report estimates that the production facilities owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> need $ 50 billion worth of renovations and modernization, according to administration and congressional sources who spoke on condition they not be identified. The report has been sent to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and accounts of some provisions of it appeared over the weekend and on Monday in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. The White House had been scheduled to send it to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> committees later this week, but an administration source said the schedule might slip. The `` theme park'' plan would organize many weapons activities around the principal nuclear material involved, eventually concentrating all plutonium processing at the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, uranium activities at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and tritium activities at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, congressional sources said. This would mean closure of the Rocky Flats plant near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, which makes plutonium triggers for thermonuclear weapons powered by tritium, and the Feed Materials Production Center near <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>., a uranium foundry, according to the report There are other activities that could be moved into the `` theme parks,'' and the sources said they were not sure just which might be moved. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmets </PERSON>, press secretary for the department, declined to comment on the report. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, D-Colo., whose district includes the Rocky Flats plant, said he was unaware of the plan for `` theme parks'' and would not comment without seeing the report The Rocky Flats plant is closed for cleanup inside one of its buildings because of accidental contamination of three employees in October. An administration source said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had not changed its estimate that $ 110 billion would be needed over the next 40 years to repair environmental damage at the 17 factories and laboratories in 12 states involved in manufacturing nuclear weapons and components. The report, called the `` 2010 report'' for the time horizon it is to look toward, calls for the operation of four new gas-cooled reactors to manufacture tritium at the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> facility and a new water-cooled reactor at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plant in a design similar to the three existing tritium reactors there. The <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> tritium reactors are closed to upgrade safety equipment and procedures. Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> has said he expected them to reopen in the spring or summer, but some published accounts have said it might be later than that. Tritium decays fairly rapidly _ 5.5 percent of any starting amount turns into inert helium in a year _ and must be replenished in the nation's nuclear weapons from time to time. Supply figures are secret. No such replenishment is needed of uranium and plutonium components, which frequently are recycled into new weapons when old ones are retired. The department's $ 6.8 billion plan to replace its tritium reactors, released last summer, called for a new <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactor and only one <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> reactor, though the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> reactor was of a `` modular'' design that could be reproduced easily. Both new designs could produce either tritium or plutonium, according to the design of the uranium fuel they are loaded with. To produce tritium, lithium is added to fuel assemblies. One congressional source said the department was faced with a choice of where to put the plutonium site, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> or the Hanford Nuclear Reservation near <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and it chose <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> because of growing opposition in the <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION> area and the severity of contamination there. The <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> reactors would sell either electricity _ or steam to make electricity _ to a local utility, according to the department's summer plan A now-mothballed Hanford reactor sold steam to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Public Power Supply System for 25 years to make electricity.

<HEAD>Ban on Medicaid Abortions Begins in Michigan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> women with unwanted pregnancies and little money began to search for alternatives to state-paid abortions Monday as a voter-approved ban on Medicaid funding for the procedure took effect. Health clinics offered discounts and no-interest loans to women unable to pay the usual abortion charge of about $ 250, but officials said they wo n't be able to cover all of the $ 6 million the state had been spending on about 18,500 Medicaid abortions a year. `` We'll be turning away some people, and we think that's really unfortunate,'' said <PERSON> Margy </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, public affairs specialist at the Ann Arbor-based Planned Parenthood of <LOCATION> Mid-Michigan </LOCATION>. Proponents of the law said that those who believe abortion is murder should n't be forced to subsidize abortions through their tax payments, and expressed hope that it would forestall some abortions. The Planned Parenthood affiliate is one of several offering financial aid to women seeking abortions. Long said Planned Parenthood will charge low-income women $ 195, the same amount Medicaid paid and about $ 70 less than what women with insurance are charged. No-interest loans will be available for those who ca n't come up with that much, she said. The Reproductive Health Care Center-Planned Parenthood of <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION> has raised nearly $ 50,000 for its emergency loan program, said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Safron </PERSON>, executive director. `` We figure it needs to be $ 100,000 or more,'' she said. But <PERSON> Safron </PERSON> said even at that level, not all women will be able to obtain abortions. `` I can only go back to my experience in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> when it de-funded women covered by Medicaid. About 90 percent sought and received abortions and 10 percent gave up trying to find the money and continued their pregnancies. We'll have to wait and see what happens in this state,'' she said. The end to Medicaid abortions came 10 days after the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canvassers </ORGANIZATION> officially certified the Nov. 8 vote by which <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> citizens decided, 57 percent to 43 percent, to stop the state funding. More than 450,000 Medicaid recipients were notified by mail that abortions would no longer be paid for beginning Monday, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>, administrator of the 15 Womancare clinics in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> which perform a large share of the state's abortions, said not all women may have realized the cutoff was taking effect. Some of those who did rushed to have the procedure done last week, resulting in a patient load on Saturday nearly double the usual, she said. `` It's quiet today because of all the rush through last week. We'll see by the end of the week how many people really heard what was going on,'' she said. By midday Monday, no one had sought to take advantage of the clinics' cut-rate of $ 50 for Medicaid women, she said. Women with private insurance or who pay cash are charged $ 225. <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> said the $ 50 fee probably will still be too much for some women. `` It's those you worry about. They may get desperate and try something foolish and then you have a hospital case. In the worst case, they die,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Monday his outlawed union Solidarity is ready to compromise for talks with Polish authorities and will strike only as a last resort. `` We are ready for agreement and compromise ... but we should be considered as free and independent,'' he told a news conference before ending a four-day visit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` We are even ready to talk to the devil and consider that hell exists on condition that he recognize there is a heaven.'' About 200 cheering supporters at the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> airport chanted `` Bravo, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON>!'' to welcome the founder of Solidarity back from the first trip abroad <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> authorities have let him take since 1981. An impromptu reception committee made up of prominent Solidarity activists, fellow passengers and Solidarity members sang `` Sto Lat'' for <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> as he emerged from customs. The song is <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s equivalent of `` For He's a Jolly Good Fellow,'' and says, `` May he live one hundred years. Supporters thrust flowers into <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s hands and police cleared a path through the crowd of photographers. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that permission to make the trip indicated a changing government attitude toward reform. `` There is a process that we want to speed up and the fact that we are here is evidence of a quickening,'' he said. After two waves of strikes earlier this year, the Polish government offered negotiations to include the government, church and opposition. The talks reached an impasse after the government refused to legalize Solidarity, which was founded in 1980, crushed during martial law in 1981 and outlawed in 1982. Solidarity is demanding the government at least signal it will consider legalization before the union will join talks. The talks were necessary, `` but on the condition we are considered free and independent,'' said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who won the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize for creating the first independent trade federation in a communist state. He said the union should continue struggling to improve the lives of its members, but must do so without destroying the country. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> does n't need any more strikes right now. Strikes are a last resort, an ultimate weapon which can ricochet and hurt society,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. He said he had high hopes for Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s attempts to reform the Soviet system. The change in Soviet society `` is a process that does not bring immediate results. It takes time to change the way people think,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said, adding he did not wish to jeopardize <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms Surrounded by representatives from most of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s trade unions and Polish emigres sporting Solidarity pins, the Polish trade unionist was ebullient, thanking President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> for inviting him to attend ceremonies Saturday marking the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On Nov. 30, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> debated the chief of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist-backed official union in a live TV broadcast that was the first time since 1983 that he has appeared on Polish television. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> needs peace and pluralism. There is a place for both -LRB- Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> and Solidarity,'' he said Monday.

In contrast to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, an exuberant campaigner, Coats is `` very low-key,'' said former Secretary of State <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simcox </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a Democrat who has run against both <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and Coats, said Coats is not a passionate speaker, but contended he is stronger than <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in other ways. `` His style was more substantive than <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s,'' said <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, who lost to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in the 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race and to Coats in the November election for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` He is more of an intellectual than is <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' The son of a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> pharmacy owner, Coats, 45, was named Monday by Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> to succeed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. This marks the second time Coats, a former congressional aide to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, has followed his ex-boss to a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In 1980, Coats won the <ORGANIZATION> 4th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> vacated to run for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Orvas Beers, the <LOCATION> Allen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> GOP chairman, said, `` I usually distinguish them by calling them <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>. Nobody ever called him <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>.'' Beers called Coats `` a kind of all-American boy,'' a successful athlete and accomplished student who became a good family man and solid congressman. Coats, he said, `` is a conservative, but he's not a nut about things. He's pragmatic.'' Coats was born in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, a conservative religious school where he was the captain of the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> small-college championship soccer team, associates said. Four years older than <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, Coats served in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for two years in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> before getting his law degree by attending night classes at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, where he was associate editor of the law review and graduated with honors. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> attended the same law school while serving in the National Guard during the Vietnam War. But he admitted talking his way into law school because his college grades at <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> were not good enough for regular admission. Coats joined <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s staff in 1976 after working as an assistant vice president and legal counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>. Married for 23 years, Coats and his wife, <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON>, have three children _ <PERSON> Laura </PERSON>, 21, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, 17, and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, 11. `` He's about as high class as you can get in every way,'' said Beers. `` He not only will be an excellent senator, but he'll be a good candidate in two years.'' Coats will have to run in a special election in 1990 to win the right to serve the final two years of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s term. Coats has never received less than 61 percent of the vote in the northeastern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> district. He defeated Long in November with 62 percent of the vote. `` There's not a lot of passion that comes through in his speech,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. `` He's very reserved, but he has a nice smile and that helps him.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, the 4th District Republican chairman, said Coats is especially attentive to his district's wishes. `` He's not ultraconservative. He really studies what the people want and votes that way. He takes a lot of surveys,'' said <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>. `` He really cares for his people.''

<TEXT>
 A federal judge Monday refused to stop random drug testing of uniformed <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents but did not rule on the constitutionality of the program. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> denied a motion by a public employees' union for a preliminary injunction, noting that other courts have refused to halt ongoing drug-testing programs while the question of their legality is still pending. <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> did not rule on the merits of the challenge, saying he would issue an opinion within a week. But the judge indicated during a hearing that he might treat testing of police officers differently than regular civilian federal employees. The random drug testing was challenged by 1,013 uniformed <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officers who guard the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and foreign embassies in the nation's capital. The Uniformed Division Officers Association contends that the urine testing is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. Just last week, <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> barred the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> from randomly testing 750 plant pest and animal disease inspectors, saying there was no justification for invading their privacy. <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> noted the inspectors did not carry weapons and were not considered law enforcement officials. In that decision, however, <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> upheld testing of individual employees suspected of being impaired by drug use while on the job. At Monday's hearing, <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> said the officers were part of a paramilitary force and had a reduced expectation of privacy stemming from their enlistment in the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` They know what kind of work they are getting into,'' <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> said. `` They go into this job with their eyes open.'' <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON>'s decision was hailed by Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> as `` recognition of the importance of ongoing drug testing in law enforcement.''

 Kidnappers holding Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said Monday they have decided to `` execute'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> as a spy for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We have issued the irrevocable sentence to execute this American spy,'' said a typewritten Arabic statement signed by the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and delivered to the independent <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper An-Nahar. A photocopy of a picture purporting to show <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, the most recent kidnap victim of nine Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was plastered at the bottom of the 15-line statement. Hostage holders in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> usually insert a picture with a statement to prove its authenticity. In its statement, the group said the decision to kill <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was a retaliation for Israeli attacks against `` our people in occupied <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>'' _ the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> _ and predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It also said <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> would die in `` revenge for the blood of the martyrs of the latest Israeli raid'' on a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla base nine miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Nine guerrillas were killed Friday in the Israeli attack. An Israeli officer also died. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said he had no details of the threat beyond press reports. `` These hostages are all innocent victims,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` They should all be released immediately. Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was there on a mission of peace as a member of an international peacekeeping operation. He, like the others, is an innocent victim.'' <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, a department spokeswoman, said later: `` The notion that kidnappers have the right to try their victims is grotesque. ... The so-called trial and outcome represent a cyncial attempt to exploit the holding of hostages, particularly during the Christmas season.'' Her statement added: `` The charge that Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is a spy is nonsense.'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was head of a 76-man observer group attached to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> when he was kidnapped near Tyre on Feb. 17. The Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, believed made up of Shiite Moslems loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, previously charged that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> used his <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> uniform as a cover for espionage. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials denied the charge. The new picture resembled a photograph released by the kidnappers April 21. That photo showed the balding <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> stoop-shouldered with his eyes cast down. He had gray stubble on his cheeks and was wearing a dark field jacket. The statement accompanying the earlier picture said the group had put <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> on trial before `` a tribunal of the oppressed'' on spying charges. In Monday's statement, the group said, `` It has been proven by clearcut evidence that -LRB- <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> -RRB- and his American team of observers are guilty of providing the Zionist enemy with accurate and detailed military and security information about our resistance fighters, their positions, movements, supply routes and the quantity and quality of their weaponry.'' `` The spy has been turned over to those responsible for executing this just and revolutionary verdict,'' the statement said. No specific execution date was mentioned. There have been three other communications from the group since <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction _ two statements listing demands for his release and a videotape in which <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> repeated the demands. The demands focused on the release of Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its proxy militia, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rejected the demands. Fifteen foreigners are missing and presumed kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They are nine Americans, three Britons, one Irishman, one Italian and a Swiss. The longest held is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' sister, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said she heard of the kidnappers' statement only from news reports. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a decorated <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran, is married to Marine Maj. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and has a 17-year-old daughter. He graduated from high school in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> and from <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> on ROTC scholarship in 1967.

 Opposition leaders insisted Monday that President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> take firm action against his predecessor, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, and ignored government attempts to calm public anger over <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s repressive rule. Radical students and dissidents protested in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities against <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who last month made a televised apology for misdeeds during eight years of military rule that ended last February. `` Arrest <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' about 40 protesters shouted when police blocked their march near a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temple in which <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> lives. Monday marked the anniversary of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s seizure of power Dec. 12, 1979. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, then a general, sent troops into <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to support <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Monday, hundreds of radical students armed with firebombs battled riot police at two universities, the news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. It reported peaceful street protests in <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kongju </LOCATION>. Police arrested 20 protesters in the central city of <LOCATION> Taejon </LOCATION>, where scores of dissidents shattered windows at the prosecutor's office <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, who won the presidential election a year ago, has opposed punishing <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. The president asked the nation to forgive his predecessor but the opposition demanded <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> be forced to testify before <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> committees investigating the actions of his government. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> has denied personal wrongdoing but some associates and relatives have been convicted of corruption. Opposition parties led by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> have urged <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to arrest aides to <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> who are linked to alleged human rights abuses. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> said the government's lukewarm attitude toward removing legacies of the Chun era was forcing him to make a decision on `` the fate of the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> regime'' and its commitment to democracy. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has promised to end ties with the old government as part of promised reforms.

 Anti-government militants Monday ordered newspapers not to print anything about next week's presidential election, said a spokesman for the four major publishing companies Leaflets written in Sinhalese were delivered the People's <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an extremist Sinhalese group that urged a boycott of the Dec. 19 balloting, said the spokesman, who insisted on anonymity The front opposes peace overtures to minority Tamils and demands the resignation of President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>. The state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and the three independent companies _ the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Upali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> _ will defy the orders, the spokesman said. They publish 12 dailies in English, Sinhalese and Tamil, and 11 weekend newspapers, with a total circulation of 275,000. Anyone who violates the orders will be treated as a and `` dealt with appropriately,'' the leaflets said. They were signed by by <PERSON> Kirthibahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijesinghe </PERSON>, widely believed to be the commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the military arm of the Marxist front. The group has vowed to kill anyone who supports the government's peace efforts. On Sunday night, assailants suspected of being Sinhalese militants fatally shot or stabbed eight Sinhalese to death in <LOCATION> Thaniyana </LOCATION> village, about 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, said military officials, who can not be identified under briefing rules. Victims included the two teen-age daughters of former village leader <PERSON> Maliyawadu </PERSON> <PERSON> Somatunga </PERSON>, a member of the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. His wife was critically injured, they said. Officials said 18 other Sinhalese were killed since Sunday in separate incidents in the south, the Sinhalese heartland. The front opposes government efforts to end the 5-year-old insurgency by Tamil rebels who demanding a separate homeland in the northern and eastern provinces. Nearly 10,000 people have been killewd since fighting began in 1983. Tamils make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people and Sinhalese are 75 percen, with control of the government and military.

<TEXT>
 Solidarity condemned anti-government violence and the government defended the past use of martial law Monday, the eve of the seventh anniversary of a crackdown on the independent labor movement. Also Monday, about 200 steel workers at the <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> steel mill near <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> went on strike, said Solidarity activist <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Handzlik </PERSON>. He said by telephone from the area that the workers are demanding a 50 percent pay increase. The plant has been a center of strikes directed by the banned Solidarity movement. Solidarity, which the government repressed when it imposed martial law seven years ago and banned in 1982, denounced the stoning of a <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> police station by about 300 young people. `` In connection with this incident, we want to recall the fundamental principle of Solidarity, which is struggle without violence,'' union spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said in a statement from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. A group of people, mostly teen-agers, marched to a police station Sunday threw stones at it, breaking most of its windows. Riot police chased away the attackers without reported arrests. The Solidarity statement did not say how closely the marchers were connected with the group. But a Solidarity spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojciechowicz </PERSON>, said older activists had tried to dissuade the younger marchers without success. The Solidarity official in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> said riot police often use `` shockingly brutal means'' against demonstrators and that many young people have grown up in the violate climate. But he added: `` Polish society as a whole does not give in to such a climate, and that is what determines our strength. Solidarity can not answer violence with violence.'' Solidarity's leader, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983. He returned to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> on Monday after a visit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, his first trip outside the country since 1981. A government communique defended Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s decision to impose martial law seven years ago, saying it `` helped to prevent national catastrophe.'' The statement was carried Monday by the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency. On Dec. 13, 1981, suppressed Solidarity and detained thousands of its faithful, including <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. Nine coal miners were killed by security forces during the crackdown, called the `` state of war'' in Polish. `` Dictated by a supreme necessity, the events ... did not stop the process of democratization and broad reforms,'' the statement said. `` Under conditions of order, not anarchy, businesslike discussion, not sterile disputes, the sense of socialist renewal was restored.'' Government officials have argued that Solidarity in the early 80s spearheaded activities that threatened the authority of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and might have prompted a Soviet invasion.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> signed into law Monday a bill calling for a sweeping overhaul of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s school system, which former federal Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> once labeled the `` worst in the nation.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> signed the bill after a symbolic walk from a 105-year-old school that is closing to the gymnasium of a new $ 4.6 million school on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. The legislation, he said, was `` an important first step.'' `` Parents and other community members have been given unprecedented opportunities with this bill to control their local school systems,'' the governor said in a statement. The much-debated measure, which takes effect in July, calls for a shift of authority from the school system's central bureaucracy to parents and principals in each of its 592 schools. It removes incumbent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and calls for the mayor to appoint a new board whose nominees are suggested by a grass-roots screening committee. The legislation also establishes local councils made up of parents, teachers and community residents. The councils _ one for each school _ will have power to hire and fire principals, draft plans for improvements and exercise some control over spending. School principals will lose tenure and work under four-year contracts to be renewed on the basis of performance. They also will have increased authority to fill teaching vacancies. `` While no law can ensure that our students will do better in the classroom, this legislation will provide a more direct and meaningful system that will be accountable for the education of our children,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. The old school where the march to the signing ceremoney began Monday was built in 1883. It is to be razed to make more room for a high-tech research development. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> led a procession of students carrying blue and gold balloons from the old school to the new. They joined school board officials in cutting a ribbon at the new school. Before the students entered the building, they let their balloons float skyward. The reform movement that provided impetus to pass the bill grew in part out of a bitter teacher strike in the fall of 1987 _ the year then-Secretary <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> schools `` the worst in the nation.'' His comments helped fan a heated citywide discussion of schools and spur legislators to action. A bill similar to the one signed into law Monday was passed by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> last summer, but that measure was caught in political bickering between <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> over control of an oversight board. The dispute was settled with passage of a new bill that gives oversight powers to the existing <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, created nearly a decade ago after an earlier financial crisis.

 An infuriated crowd, shoving and jostling and demanding justice, followed <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s mayor on his inspection on Monday of a charred marketplace where 62 people died in an inferno caused by illegal fireworks. From a balcony, residents flung soggy pieces of burnt paper and wood at Mayor <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON>, who took office Dec. 1. One person waved a sign that asked, `` To whom do we owe this tragedy?'' Hundreds of people milled around <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> as he and his aides tramped over muddy ashes and past burned candy stores, melted rolls of plastic, soaked cigarette packages, mounds of scorched peanuts and twisted steel beams. `` We share the pain of the families who lost relatives in this tragedy,'' the mayor said during his visit to Merced market in the heart of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The shouting crowd led him to untended stalls where crates of unexploded fireworks were still stored after Sunday's disaster. <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> promised to have them removed. `` You have to give us justice. Six-year -LRB- presidential -RRB- terms come and go but nothing changes. We do n't want you to forget us,'' vendor <PERSON> Liborio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chocihua </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> and his aides are presidential appointees. Local district attorney <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON> on Monday set the toll at 62 dead and 83 injured. None of those hurt were reported in serious condition. The cause of the accident is under investigation, but officials and residents blame illegal fireworks. Fireworks traditionally are used from Dec. 12, the Day of the Virgin of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>, until New Year's Day. <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> announced a ban on the sale and use of fireworks in the <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> _ something that is already forbidden without special permit. His aides said none of the vendors in the market appeared to have permits. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Tirado </PERSON> and other vendors said illegal fireworks caused lesser explosions and fires in the past, but the government did nothing to prevent their sale. `` Usually there are only a few injured, or one or two killed,'' <PERSON> Tirado </PERSON> said. Thousands of Merced marketplace vendors work out of stalls on the street, selling everything from radios to fruit _ and, in December, fireworks. The market was clogged with shoppers when the blasts started. Explosions ripped through stalls. Screaming people fled the scene. Dozens died in nearby buildings, trapped when the buildings caught fire. `` In a matter of seconds everything was gone,'' said candy seller <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>. Bulldozers ground through yard-deep muck on Monday, clearing away the wreckage. <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON> said firefighters carted away tons of unexploded, unsold fireworks during the night. A child's pail lay on its side, near a pair of women's shoes abandoned in the panic. One vendor's table was topped by a pyramid of blackened, melted fruit. Strands of festive red and silver Christmas bunting still draped remains of another stall.

 A Canadian businessman offered $ 36.25 million Monday for the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> television ministry, but a bankruptcy official said the bid probably will be rejected by a judge. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s court-appointed trustee, M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, said `` I would have to conclude'' that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> would not approve the offer when it is reported to him at a hearing Tuesday in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> predicted <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> would order the ministry's assets liquidated. But he said it's possible the judge would open bidding again at Tuesday's hearing. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> has declined to comment on the proceedings. The judge had wanted the bidding to start at $ 50 million. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> and the bidders declined to say why the bids were far short, and far below offers made earlier. But the prospective buyers said more bids were expected Tuesday. `` This is more or less a card game where each side is testing the other side, and I think they -LRB- the bidders -RRB- are looking forward to meeting in court with a proposal all of their own,'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> has said if no appropriate bid was made, he would order a liquidation of the ministry. If a bidder meets his guidelines during the auction run by <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, the judge said he planned to approve a sale Tuesday. The ministry filed for bankruptcy reorganization in June 1987, three months after founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left amid revelations of luxurious living and hush money paid to <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, a church secretary with whom <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had a sexual liaison. Monday's high bid was put in by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> real-estate developer and orthodox Jew. The opening bid was $ 20 million by <PERSON> Cy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahakel </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> state senator who now owns 15 television stations. The offers were far below the appraised value of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets _ between $ 92 million and $ 110 million, and half of that offered in the initial auction in November. The auction, which was closed to the public, began about 2 p.m. and ended about 3:45 p.m. The four apparent contenders for the assets _ <LOCATION> Mernick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahakel </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and a new bidder, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Karas </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> _ all said they may bid Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> did not bid Monday. <PERSON> Karas </PERSON> said he dropped out of the bidding shortly after it began because he said it was obvious none of them was going to meet the terms set down by <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION>, which included starting bids at $ 50 million. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he held off bidding because he was unwilling to meet a condition of the sale that called for the down payment to be forfeited if the would-be buyer is unable to secure financing. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> had said he intended to offer less than $ 70 million for the 2,200 acres of property, which includes a 500-room hotel, a water park, a television studio and a 2,000-seat church. A month ago, <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> said he would pay $ 115 million, $ 50 million of it cash. But <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> rejected the bid, saying there were inadequate assurances that <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> would pay the remaining $ 65 million. Asked Monday why he bid only $ 36.25 million, he said, `` That's the bid I made. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s group held a telethon on <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s TV show last weekend to try to bring contributions up to $ 5 million for a deposit on the property. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the last of the money was raised shortly before noon on Monday. `` This $ 5 million represents a statement on the part of the body of Christ that can not be ignored,'' he said on Monday's television show. The only appraisal so far of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s property is based on its value as an active ministry. That appraisal, conducted for <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> by <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, says that with a `` charismatic leader,'' the property would be worth $ 110 million. Under a `` stabilized ministry,'' with no well-known figure to solicit donations, the estimate dropped to $ 92 million. The appraisal estimated that, sold piecemeal, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> would bring from $ 76 million to $ 85 million. Some say the lack of interest in the property puts those figures in serious doubt, and that the scandals involving <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> make the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> property even harder to sell. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his top <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> deputy, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, were indicted last week on fraud charges.

 Three trains crashed into each other near a busy south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> junction during rush hour Monday morning, hurling bodies onto the tracks as the cars `` split open like a ripe tomato.'' Officials said they counted 36 dead. More than 110 of the estimated 1,500 passengers on the trains were hospitalized, 32 with serious injuries such as multiple fractures, crushed abdomens and amputations, hospital and ambulance officials said. The British <ORGANIZATION> Railways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said a preliminary investigation cast blame on a `` technical fault'' that arose after work on signaling equipment. `` It is sheer bloody hell, that's what it is,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant chief officer, surveying the scene at the <ORGANIZATION> Clapham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junction </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s busiest train crossways. Police and Fire Brigade officials said 34 people died in the crash and two died later at a hospital, bringing the death toll to 36. Some bodies were so badly dismembered that limbs were placed in separate body bags, adding to confusion about the toll, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, a Fire Brigade divisional officer. Police inspector <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said some limbs were unaccounted for and therefore the toll could rise. The accident occurred just before 8 a.m. when a London-bound commuter train slammed into the rear of another passenger train that was stopped about 400 yards south of <LOCATION> Clapham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION>. The two trains were packed with 1,500 people, many of whom were standing. Rescue efforts began, but an empty freight train on an adjacent line then plowed into spillover wreckage and apparently hit some passengers who had scrambled onto the tracks. `` Bodies were cut in half, limbs were thrown around by the impact,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Winch </PERSON>, a doctor. Three cars hurtled into the air and onto an embankment and eight overturned. A fourth train, crowded with commuters, stopped a few feet short of the wreck, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> said. Rescue teams working under arc lights used heavy lifting equipment and hydraulic jacks through the early morning hours Tuesday searching the mangled debris for more trapped victims. Many passengers, dazed or slightly injured, were able to walk away, but <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambulance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said 114 passengers were taken to five local hospitals, 30 with serious injuries, and others were treated on the scene. Dozens of passengers were trapped, some for up to five hours, waiting for rescue workers to hack through dense underbrush alongside the tracks and to pry open roofs of overturned carriages. Others walked away in search of other transport to their jobs in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. A man clutched a crushed briefcase to his chest. Another, in a smart business suit, carried a blood-spattered raincoat. Seats were snapped from their mountings and strewn alongside the wreckage. Briefcases, newspapers and business documents littered the track and the embankment. A child's stroller lay atop one carriage. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, the fire brigade's chief divisional officer, said all survivors were rescued by 1 p.m. but he feared `` there may be further bodies underneath'' the wreckage. It was the worst train wreck in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since 1975, when 43 died in a subway that crashed in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> tunnel. Forty-nine people were killed in a 1967 when a train derailed in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Transport Minister <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> promised a full inquiry. <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers and railroad union leaders demanded that the inquiry examine allegations of overcrowding and cuts in safety spending on state-owned British Rail. The trains are not part of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s subway system. Rescue workers, many visibly distraught, used infrared cameras, metal cutters and cranes to free passengers. Emergency surgery, including amputations, were performed on the scene. Operations continued after nightfall, bathed in floodlights. `` Bodies were ripped apart and the trains were tangled together,'' said firefighter <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>. `` We had to use our heaviest cutting gear and it was like nibbling away at the wreckage just a little at a time.'' `` There were pieces of bodies lying all over the place. You could hear people moaning,'' said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> of the ambulance service. Passenger <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> was in the buffet car of the moving train when the crash occurred and `` the roof split open like a ripe tomato.'' `` There was furniture and enormous lumps of metal flying everywhere,'' he said. `` We tried to find people underneath the rubble but there was so much debris, there was nothing we could do.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Emmanuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> near the scene of the crash was transformed into a makeshift clinic for scores of walking injured. Schoolboys scrambled down the banks to help rescue survivors. Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> and archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> expressed grief and condolences. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she was `` grief-stricken.'' British Rail and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railwaymen </ORGANIZATION> said they would hold their own inquiries. Monday's accident is the third serious train crash in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in the last month. On Nov. 30, 15 passengers were injured in a crash outside Newcastle-upon-Tyne and on Nov. 12, a driver was killed and 18 passengers hurt in a derailment near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helens </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s worst crash occurred in May 1915 when 227 people were killed and 246 injured in a collision between a troop train and passenger train at <LOCATION> Gretna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION>, southwest <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is holding lotteries these days for beds, trying to be fair as it goes about meeting long lines at the shelter each day. Even in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, there's just no getting used to the kinds of demands that record cold can put on people. The first blast of the 1988-89 winter season Monday brought a record low for the date of 2 degrees, with most of the impact seen at shelters. At the <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, seven homeless people were in line as the doors to the shelter opened at 6:30 a.m. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, in charge of admitting people to the shelter, said a lottery has been held before noon in recent days for the beds. Those who lose out are referred to other shelters or offered a blanket and the floor. He said that typically, about 60 people take part in the lottery seeking one of the 40 beds at the shelter available for transients. The other 20 beds at the shelter are used by residents who stay for months while they take part in a rehabilitation program. Throughout the city Sunday night, about 75 people were transported to shelters, and more were expected as the cold weather continues, Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. Electricity demand set a wintertime record in the region Monday and came close to surpassing the all-time record, a spokesman said. `` I do n't have a final number set for today yet, but we can definitely say we surpassed the previous winter record of 19,277 megawatts,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheperdson </PERSON> of the New England Power Pool. Monday's average peak load was between 19,400 and 19,500 megawatts, he said. The system record of 19,500 megawatts was set during a heat wave in August. Elsewhere, life went on, albeit at a slower pace. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> fishermen at the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pier </ORGANIZATION> told of chipping ice off the bows with wooden mallets to keep trawlers from getting nose heavy. `` No grog. A lot of coffee,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, 38, a mate aboard the Olympia, an 86-foot fishing trawler that had just returned from a week at sea. `` As long as you're moving, it is n't bad,'' said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, wearing four layers of long-sleeved shirts and a cap with ear flaps. `` The bad part is if we do damage. Then you've got to stop and mend it up. That's bare-handed. That's nasty.'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Southmayd </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> window washing service, said workers use a special non-freeze solution in bitter weather. `` I'm sure -LRB- any window washer -RRB- is miserable, but it's all in the line of work,'' Southmayd said. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cudyer </PERSON>, who runs the city's 24-hour hotline for citizen complaints, said her office received about 100 calls since the temperature took a dive Sunday. Most were about a lack of heat from tenants whose landlords seemed unprepared for the cold, she said. `` In winter it's inevitable. But when it was 50 degrees last week, they let the oil run out,'' she said. `` They were caught by the dramatic swing in temperature from 50 to 0 in a matter of days.'' The homeless problem in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> gets special attention from a city commission and a mayor who heads a national conference on the issue. At a city-sponsored summit Monday on the homeless, which was designed to begin building a groundswell of support for more federal participation in providing affordable housing, speakers said efforts must focus on moving beyond temporary shelter to permanent housing. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said the federal commitment to providing housing dropped off sharply during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The mayor also touted <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s pledge to provide a warm bed and hot meal for anyone on the streets. Results of a street-by-street count of the homeless have not been tallied yet, but <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said preliminary figures indicate it will top the 3,300 recorded in February. The number of city shelter beds has increased from 972 in 1983 to 2,754 this year. Shelter officials say they see more children than before. At the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a special party was planned Tuesday for 350 children with actress <PERSON> Liv </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullmann </PERSON> and a live performance of the `` Nutcracker'' ballet.

<TEXT>
 Three paintings by <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>, including his early masterpiece `` The Potato Eaters,'' were stolen from a national museum on Monday night, police said. The art theft appeared to be the biggest in Dutch history. The van <PERSON> Goghs </PERSON> were taken from the Kroeller-Mueller National Museum near the West German border by thieves who apparently gained entry through a broken window after closing hours, said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Bep </PERSON> <PERSON> Lijftogt </PERSON>. The two other paintings by the 19th-century Dutch impressionist were `` Dried Sunflowers'' and `` <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>'s Interior,'' she reported. Two guards were in the sprawling, single-story museum at the time, but they noticed nothing amiss, said police spokesman <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Talsma </PERSON>. Police immediately sealed off the 25-acre park in which the museum sits. A helicopter equipped with floodlights and police with dogs hunted for suspects on the heavily forested grounds. They suspended the search at 1 a.m. Tuesday and planned to resume at daybreak. No official valuation of the paintings was available from the museum, but the director of <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction gallery in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> said that if sold on the open market _ not possible for a stolen work _ `` The Potato Eaters'' could bring as much as <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Sunflowers. That painting brought $ 39.9 million when auctioned off in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in March 1987. `` The sky's the limit,'' <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s director <PERSON> Harts </PERSON> <PERSON> Nijstad </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. `` ` The Potato Eaters' is an enormously important painting. `` The Potato Eaters'' in the Kroeller-Mueller museum was the most complete of several versions of the same subject, according to <PERSON> Nijstad </PERSON>, who said a less important version sits in the van <ORGANIZATION> Gogh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. No estimate on the value of the other two paintings was immediately available, but <PERSON> Nijstad </PERSON> said all three were `` frightfully important.'' He speculated that the paintings were stolen for ransom, adding, `` Whether the ransom will be money-wise or political is something the future will tell us.'' The museum's silent alarm triggered a warning in the local police station at about 8:45 p.m. -LRB- 2:45 p.m. EST -RRB-, and police rushed to the museum. Completed in 1885, `` The Potato Eaters'' is one of van <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s most poignant depictions of poverty and hunger in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> It shows a farm family seated around a table eating potatoes by lamplight, the hunger evident on their angular faces. Five van <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> works were included in a list published two weeks ago of the top 10 prices paid for paintings at the world's two major auction houses, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Irises'' was sold last month for $ 53.9 million, the highest price paid for any painting in the world. The Kroeller-Mueller has dozens of <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Goghs </PERSON> exhibited in a special wing. The museum and surrounding estate were bequeathed to the nation in 1938 by art collector Mrs. H.E.L.G. Kroeller-Mueller. The theft was the latest in a series of recent burglaries at Dutch museums. In May, thieves broke a window and stole impressionist paintings by <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>, French painter <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON> and Dutch painter <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jongkind </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s Municipal Museum. Those paintings were initially valued at up to $ 50 million, but art authorities later scaled down the estimated value. The paintings were later recovered in a raid on an <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> hotel spearheaded by an undercover policeman posing as a buyer of stolen art. That theft, mounted through a broken ground-floor window at a time when no guards were in the <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> museum, prompted calls for stronger security in the nation's museums. The Kroeller-Mueller museum never before had a major theft, police spokesman <PERSON> Talsma </PERSON> said. `` The Potato Eaters'' was painted when <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> was living in a village in southern <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>. It is considered his most ambitious work from his Dutch period, before he moved to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1886 and came under the influence of Impressionism. The painting is done in dark colors in a rough style, which van <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> said in a letter to his brother was meant to illustrate the rough life that the peasants lived. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s artistic career lasted only 10 years, but during that time he produced about 850 paintings. About 50 of the paintings are still in private hands, according to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Roundell </PERSON>, who supervised the `` Sunflowers'' sale. A highly placed source at the <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gogh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> said on condition of anonymity last month that one great fear his museum had was that the record prices being paid for works by <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> would bring ideas of theft into people's heads. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> sold only one painting during his lifetime.

<HEAD>Parliament Returns for Trade Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s government announced its intention Monday to make sure <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> can start the free trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as scheduled Jan. 1. But his opponents said too many issues remain to be discussed for the legislation to be rushed through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, called back into session for work on the trade bill. The prime minister's <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won 169 of the 295 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> in the hotly contested Nov. 21 elections, so it could force quick passage of the legislation. The measure will phase out all remaining tariffs between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> over a 10-year period. `` The people have spoken in a general election three weeks ago,'' Gov. Gen. <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sauve </PERSON> said in the formal `` throne speech'' traditionally opening a new parliamentary session in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. `` In the election, my government sought and received a mandate for its policies, including the free trade agreement between <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that is to take effect on Jan. 1, 1989.'' The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which won 82 seats in Commons, and the socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with 43 seats have said they will not stand in the way of ultimate passage but want extensive debate on the problems they believe the trade agreement will bring. The bitter debate over free trade that marked the fall election campaign would be renewed in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. One seat, won by a Conservative who died after the election, is vacant. Liberal leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who led a self-proclaimed `` crusade'' against the trade agreement, said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that he was not stalling the legislation. `` To insist on a thorough debate - that's not stalling,'' he said, noting that the popular vote showed more Canadians in favor of the two parties opposing the agreement than for the Conservatives. New Democratic leader <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> said he wanted amendments to be introduced to protect workers whose jobs are lost in company restructurings tied to the trade agreement. He told the <ORGANIZATION> CBC </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> won a mandate for the trade agreement, but `` he received no mandate to ramrod it right through Parliament.'' A delay of days, weeks or probably even months in completing the enabling legislation needed would not hinder the agreement. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has completed all its legislation for the agreement, signed by <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last Jan. 2. In <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, it passed the elected House of Commons last August but then was bottled up in the Liberal-controlled, appointed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to force the election. The legislation approved last August has expired and the process now must be repeated in Commons.

Capt. <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said that Maj. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Negapatan </PERSON>, 59, and his son, <PERSON> Patrolman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Negapatan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, about 30, were standing on a street corner in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> when three men and a woman emerged from a taxi.

<HEAD>Peruvian Miners Agree to Halt Crippling Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT SEAVEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government and a communist-led mine workers' federation signed an accord late Monday to end an 8-week-old strike that has cost <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> nearly $ 300 million, Prime Minister <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON> said. Strike leader <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantoral </PERSON> said miners will resume work nationwide in three days, bringing an end to a paralysis in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s most important industry <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON> told reporters the strike cost the nation nearly $ 300 million, one-fourth of last year's mineral export income of $ 1.2 billion last year. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is a leading world producer of silver and copper and a major source of gold, lead and zinc. It traditionally received more than half of its hard currency earnings from mineral exports. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s 60,000 miners struck on Oct. 17 to force mine companies to honor a government-union pact permitting labor contracts in the mining industry to be negotiated jointly with all mining enterprises rather than on a company-by-company basis. The strike came as <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> entered a severe recession, marked by inflation expected to surpass 1,500 percent this year and a shortage of dollar reserves to purchase vital imports. Industry officials said strikers were being manipulated by communist guerrillas seeking to undermine the nation. The miners' federation denied it Terms of the new accord signed by <PERSON> Cantoral </PERSON> and other leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> and Metalworkers and by <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON> were not immediately announced. Federation director <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said earlier Monday that the federation was demanding that the government promise to enact a law to force public and private mining firms to abide by the government-union pact. Such an agreement will greatly strengthen the miners' bargaining position during contracts, industry analysts said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s most important association of private mine owners, has strongly opposed joint contract negotiations. It says the federation will use its bargaining power to cripple the industry at will. Government and industry officials said more than half the strikers began returning to work last week. The federation, which represents dozens of mine unions, denied the report. Thousands of highland miners, many with families, marched on <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> after the strike began and set up camps around the city to publicize their plight. Miners engaged in street protests which at times ended in violence and arrests.

 Earthquake relief efforts in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> are hampered by bad organization, Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said Monday. Hope dwindled for people trapped in the rubble, and the smell of decaying corpses filled the air. Other officials said rescuers working around the clock with everything from their bare hands to fiber optic cameras have pulled more than 18,000 people from earthquake wreckage. `` The work is not going badly, but we would wish it to be more organized,'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> told foreign journalists at a news conference in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. He also said many people died unnecessarily in Wednesday's earthquake because poorly built houses collapsed into ruins `` We believe gross violations were permitted'' in designing and building the apartment houses that collapsed. `` If the homes had been of good-quality construction, something like this would not have happened,'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said. He said this view was shared by a government investigative commission and by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who visited the disaster area over the weekend. Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, published a scathing article Monday about `` scrap-builders'' who constructed shoddy apartment buildings that crumbled into `` concrete and metal graves over victims who were buried alive.'' Health Minister <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON> estimated the temblor killed up to 60,000 people. <PERSON> Ryzkhov </PERSON> said it was certain that 15,000 had died, but the figure would problably rise to 45,000. Five days after the tragedy struck, shelter and salvage equipment remained in short supply. Reporting Monday from <LOCATION> Leninaken </LOCATION>, near the quake's epicenter, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, `` People wander among the debris of what used to be their homes, straining their ears in the hope of hearing the voice of a missing sister, father, brother or simply any human voice.'' Soviet television showed a worker in <LOCATION> Kirovakan </LOCATION>, where 60 percent of the houses were destroyed, bending a metal reinforcing rod in a collapsed concrete wall by hand, his face strained with the effort. Another man moved mounds of broken concrete with a shovel. A man and boy huddled over a fire in a small bucket, their only source of warmth during what the television announcer described as five nights on a pile of rubble because there were not enough tents. Snow and temperatures of 14-23 degrees Fahrenheit were forecast. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Shcherbina </PERSON>, a deputy prime minister who directed the cleanup after the April 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear plant accident, told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>: `` We shall work without letup to save everyone still alive under the debris, even on the 10th and the 12th day after the disaster. We shall work for as long as there is a chance to save the life of at least one unhappy victim.'' He said more than 5,000 people had been rescued in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 18,500 had been saved in the entire disaster area, which had a population of 700,000. But <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said at the new conference that only 5,398 had been saved throughout the region. He said 10 people were pulled alive from the rubble on Monday. Associated Press correspondent <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, a city of more than 25,000 before the quake, and said the smells of burning and decomposing bodies were everywhere. A British charity called <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> said its 14-member team in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> was using ultrasonic listening equipment and fiber optic cameras to locate survivors trapped under collapsed buildings. More than 200 search dogs were helping, and infrared devices that can detect the warmth of bodies trapped under rubble. Many of the nearly 1,000 foreign helpers have said local officials are not organizing the rescue well and interpreters to help translate the many languages are scarce. The second crash of a relief plane in two days was reported. All seven crewmembers died when a Soviet-built Yugoslav military transport loaded with medical equipment and other supplies went down 10 miles from the airport in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, capital of the Armenian republic. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Panyukov </PERSON>, first deputy aviation minister, made the announcement in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Local reporters said the An-12 cargo plane crashed before dawn because the pilot mistook a well-lighted highway for a runway. On Sunday, a Soviet military plane bringing soldiers to help the rescue effort crashed as it approached <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>'s airport, killing 78 people. Aid continued pouring in from abroad. Council of Ministers spokesman <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Voznesensky </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> news conference 38 foreign relief planes had arrived and the most, six, were from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> of the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> there was little hope of finding more survivors. He said the only people still alive would be those who found water and air where they were trapped. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> quoted reports that only 150 people survived in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>; other reports say 10 percent lived. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Armenian </LOCATION> activists said demonstrators fought with soldiers because several nationalist leaders were arrested. One activist who avoided arrest, <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>, said by telephone three protests took place Sunday in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> because leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> were arrested. The committee has led a campaign for Armenian control of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a predominantly Armenian region of neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. He said soldiers and demonstrators fought during a protest near the railway station and several people were wounded. An editor at Armenpress confirmed the violence but said it did not appear to have been serious.

 Rescuers and officials trying to save survivors of the earthquake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> said Monday they desperately need a better command system, more coordination, and better equipment. In addition, no Soviet troops were visible among the rescue workers in <LOCATION> Leninaken </LOCATION>, one of the hardest-hit cities in Wednesday's earthquake Instead, the rescue operations were being carried out mostly by friends and relatives of those still trapped. They used small tools like hammers and torches. Soviet Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said enthusiam was plentiful, but `` today the question is organization.'' He spoke at a news conference late Monday in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital. <PERSON> Sverre </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilde </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> disaster relief officer, said the rescue effort appeared well organized on the national and regional level, but locally in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> it was suffering from a lack of control. `` Here there are 50-60 people shouting in all directions,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diaster relief officer <PERSON> Sverre </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilde </PERSON>, speaking of a rescue site he visited in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> on Sunday. `` It would have been much more reasonable to have an army captain or colonel in charge of it.'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> told reporters that more than 18,000 soldiers were in the earthquake area, but in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> none was seen helping with rescue operations. Asked about the situation, <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said the soldiers were ensuring order in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> and helping unload relief supplies from cargo planes. They also said troops were involved in rescue operations in <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, a city of more than 25,000 people that was almost totally destroyed by the earthquake. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said soldiers had cut off both cities to all but relief traffic. Two relief planes have crashed in heavy air traffic in the region. A crash of a Soviet military plane on Sunday killed 78 people, and one of a <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> military aircraft left seven dead early Monday. The Soviet premier gave high marks to the medical effort, saying doctors had performed 2,500 complicated operations in the field during the first 24 hours after the quake. However, area doctors said they badly need artificial kidney machines and blood-filtering devices. They hope to receive more of both from abroad. Veterans of rescue efforts for past earthquakes in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> say it is difficult to supply the remote Soviet area near the Turkish border. Rescuers, meanwhile, pleaded for more cranes and bulldozers to pull away slabs of concrete and other debris in an effort to free those still trapped in the rubble.

 A Washington-based forensics expert arrived Monday to begin examining the bodies of six women found in southeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> since July believed to be the victims of a serial killer. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ubelaker </PERSON> of the Smithsonian Institution will seek more details on the cause of death of all six and will attempt to identify the three bodies that remain unidentified, according to a spokesman for the investigation.

The body is one of three which has yet to be identified. `` To make a positive identification, we need to find something on the skeleton that is absolutely unique,'' <PERSON> Ubelaker </PERSON> said in an earlier interview.

 An Italian <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> stunt pilot who replaced a colleague who died in the disaster at a West German air show in August was killed on Monday when his plane crashed during a training flight, news reports said. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> reported that the plane, an Aermacchi MB339, crashed about 10 minutes after takeoff into a field in northeastern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> outside the city of <LOCATION> Udine </LOCATION>. The pilot, identified as Lt. Col. <PERSON> Paolo </PERSON> <PERSON> Scoponi </PERSON>, 36, was flying solo, <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said. It reported that the victim was an experienced test pilot who recently joined the `` <ORGANIZATION> Frecce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tricolori </ORGANIZATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> squad which performs air shows. Three Italian stunt jets from the squad collided during an air show at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> on Aug. 28, and one of the jet plunged into the crowd of spectators. Seventy people died and several hundred were injured. A report issued in October by the West German defense ministry blamed pilot error for the crash. The squad's name means `` Tri-color Arrows'' and refers to the red, white and green of the Italian flag. Founded in 1930 as a school of aerobatics, it has been a separate unit of the Italian air force since 1956.

 By the time Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> left for college, he was well on the way to fulfilling the ambition he expressed in his senior yearbook: `` For my family to always be proud of me.'' His uncle, <PERSON> Delbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, said following <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction Feb. 17 in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that whatever happens, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> would continue to make his family and his country proud `` He loves his country,'' <PERSON> Eagle </PERSON> said at the time. `` He is capable of standing up as well as an ordinary man will under the circumstances. ... I do n't think they could bring enough pressure or pain to cause him to betray his country in any way. `` I think he would die first.'' On Monday, Lebanese kidnappers holding <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, said in a statement they have sentenced him to death as a spy for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We have issued the irrevocable sentence to execute this American spy,'' said the typewritten Arabic statement signed by the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. But the statement did not set an execution date. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' sister, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, said she had no knowledge of the death threat other than what she has heard from news reports. `` I have not been contacted by anyone,'' she said. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was a onetime aide to former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>. When he was abducted, he headed a 75-member observer group assigned to a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official said at the time of the abduction that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was on temporary detail serving as the chief of the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization's <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The group monitors cease-fire violations on the <LOCATION> Lebanon-Israel </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was the top-ranking American officer assigned to the group, holding the title of senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military observer. When <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was growing up in southern <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in the late 1950s and early 1960s, his friends never expected the chunky, cheerful youngster to make his career in the military. `` He was just pretty much an average guy at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, an old friend, recalled after <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction `` I think people were kind of surprised when he went into the Marines,'' <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> added. `` You think of the Marines as being macho types, and he really was n't like that.'' Even so, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> won appointment to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, but chose instead to study at <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> on a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ROTC scholarship. He opted for the Marines rather than the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> after suffering seasickness during a summer cruise to <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, his brother-in-law, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, recalled. Others who knew <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> remember him as a bright, well-rounded young man who stood out in school and on the athletic field. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, whose friends knew him as `` Rich'' or `` Pinky,'' earned mostly A's and B's. He played guard on his high school football team in 1962 and 1963. `` He gave us 100 percent effort,'' said <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, then the team's line coach. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was president of his sophomore class, vice president of his senior class and won membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Key </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, according to his senior yearbook. His fellow seniors and teachers voted him one of the top 10 members of the class of 1963, based on scholarship, leadership, school spirit and personality, said Assistant Principal <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant when he graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION>, and later earned master's degrees in human resources management at <ORGANIZATION> Pepperdine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and political science at <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, and lived in <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Covington </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. He and his first wife, the former <PERSON> Bonita </PERSON> <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, have a 17-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>. He has another sister, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' second wife, Marine Maj. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, works at the Pentagon Both of his parents have died _ his mother, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, in 1979, and his father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, shortly after his abduction.

Tests were performed Sunday and doctors found three partially blocked arteries and decided to perform bypass surgery, she said. One of the arteries was the same one that became blocked before, leading to October's angioplasty, a procedure in which a small balloon is inserted into an artery and inflated, breaking away a blockage. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>' wife, singer <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Colter </PERSON>, and son were with him at the hospital, and the entertainer was in good spirits before the procedure, Ms. <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, whose work on 13 million-selling albums has won him two Grammy awards and four Country Music Association awards, is probably best known for his duet with <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> on `` Mamas, Do n't Let Your Babies Grow Up to be Cowboys.''

 Nearly 10 million Americans lost their jobs due to plant closings or layoffs from 1983 to 1988 despite the longest peacetime economic expansion in the nation's history, the government reports.

That was a slight decline from earlier BLS studies of overlapping five-year periods _ 1979-84 and 1981-86 _ which both had shown that 5.1 million tenured workers lost their jobs during the respective periods. But each of those periods also included the severe recession of 1981-82. As a result, government and private economists say the new figures show a persisting displacement problem.

The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the 13,239 federally insured commercial banks earned $ 5.9 billion in the third quarter, topping the previous record of $ 5.8 billion in the same quarter last year. `` I think we can say without much question that this year will be an all-time high for banking profits,'' <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> told reporters. The current record of $ 18.1 billion was set in 1985. Last year, banks earned only $ 3.6 billion, the least profitable year since the Depression, as they added heavily to reserves for losses on Third World debt.

 Supporters of a substantial pay raise for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are working behind the scenes to dampen potential opposition and allow it to take effect automatically in February. But several lawmakers are lying in wait for the the perennially prickly issue, and it appears unlikely to slide through without a fight. `` I think we're all going to have a chance to face up to it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. `` Some of the members are probably home working on their speeches now. A presidential commission is due to recommend by Thursday boosts in pay for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, 3,000 federal judges and top executive-branch officials. The panel will meet Tuesday to discuss the proposed raises, expected to be as much as 50 percent.

<TEXT>
 Panamanians are fleeing, unemployment is rising, the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> is suffering, the American military is steaming and bank profits are falling. About the only firm thing in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s grip on it. `` The country is going down the drain fast,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He and <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Carles </PERSON> of the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> said up to 40,000 Panamanians have left in 18 months. Unemployment is up from 11 percent in 1987 to 23 percent. The treasury is in a bind and public employees went on strike, demanding to be paid on time. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administrator for the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> says his job may not be turned over to a Panamanian next year as required by the canal treaty and that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s anti-Noriega sanctions indirectly hinder operations at the canal, which is to be turned over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at midnight Dec. 31, 1999. In recent months, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has imprisoned critics, changed election laws to make it easier for himself to run for president in May 1989 and closed four opposition newspapers, including <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>. The opposition is reduced to receiving news by facsimile machines from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Fax and photocopies, the No. 1 means of communication,'' <PERSON> Carles </PERSON> said in an interview. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s trip down the chute began in June 1987 with allegations that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> rigged the 1984 elections, laundered money and trafficked in drugs and arms. Relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, traditionally close because of the canal. took a nosedive last February when President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as head of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had the legislature dismiss <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> instead. <LOCATION> Washingto </LOCATION> refused to recognize the new president, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, and imposed economic sanctions in an effort to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out. Six opposition parties recently signed a petition calling for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster and formation of a transition government for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 2.2 million people. They have not yet decided whether to enter candidates in next year's presidential election, nor has the general said whether he will run. `` The people are scared to death,'' <PERSON> Carles </PERSON> said. `` How can we have elections if everything is under <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s control?'' Repeated calls were made to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s spokesman, Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, and to leading members of the military-backed <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> but were not returned. Banks closed for nine weeks last March and figures issued by the government indicated deposits at the more than 100 institutions operating in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> dropped from nearly $ 30 billion to just under $ 8 billion. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions put <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the same economic boat with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the other Latin American countries on which <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> imposed boycotts, and compounded problems that began with the political strife. `` This is one of the things that has really hurt the external image,'' said <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasso </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, because `` the others are communist countries.'' The government limited bank withdrawals, putting a $ 100 ceiling on what could be withdrawn from savings accounts. Many Panamanians stopped banking and sold certificates of deposit for less than market value. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has taken up the time-tested cry of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> about a threat of imminent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion, except that in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s case about 10,000 American soldiers already are in the country <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is headquarters for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and the soldiers, nominally stationed here for the purpose of defending the canal, use the strategic location for intelligence gathering and spy flights over <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Officers of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> claim Panamanian troops trespass nightly on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military facilities, and have reported exchanges of fire in two dozen cases. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> was shot to death by a comrade in April. `` The goal is to embarrass the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and raise the level of a sense of vulnerability,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. The 1977 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties specify that the troops must leave when the 50-mile-long waterway is turned over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> but an accompanying pact requires the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to assure `` indefinitely a regime providing for the permanent neutrality of the canal.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said the provision calling for a Panamanian to take over his job at the end of 1989 is up in the air because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president must approve the choice and anyone `` who bears the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> imprint will never be acceptable.'' <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> said canal operations suffer somewhat because, under the economic embargo, the canal commission can not pay its Panamanian employees' withholding taxes and the government has begun harassing workers for the money. `` The fact is they are so nervous right now it's affecting morale and that affects the efficiency of our operation,'' said <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, a retired Army general.

<HEAD>Trouble at the Top of the Underworld in Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KOBE, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Each day children on their way home from school calmly walk past the headquarters of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest underworld syndicate, behind plastered beige walls in a classy residential district overlooking the sea. Across town, a red-tiled building controlled by the gang is within 100 yards of the <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courthouse </ORGANIZATION>. It bears the golden, diamond-shaped logo of the gang, which leaders wear on their lapels and which is printed on members' business cards. Over the past few years the Yamaguchi-gumi syndicate has waged a successful war of revenge against a major rival, doubled its membership and raked in millions of dollars annually, said <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishii </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s Organized Crime Control Office But all is not well within the criminal empire. The year's business for the 20,000-member syndicate traditionally starts Dec. 13, when ranking bosses gather at headquarters in this western port city for a formal celebration called `` koto hajime'' _ the beginning of things. But since gang leader <PERSON> Masahisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Takenaka </PERSON> was killed by a splinter group's gunman in 1985, custom has forced the Yamaguchi-gumi to cancel the annual ceremony because it has no top don. <PERSON> Takenaka </PERSON> was replaced by two men, acting gang leader <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakanishi </PERSON> and `` young leader'' <PERSON> Yoshinori </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, who led the gang into a war to avenge <PERSON> Takenaka </PERSON>'s killing, police say. Though that vendetta, which has left 25 dead and 70 injured by police count, now seems to be nearing an end, police say the long time without a leader has led to factionalism in the gang, weakening its pyramid-style command structure. Public reaction to the high-profile violence has also plagued the gang. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has low rates of violent crime and very strict gun-control laws. But gunfights have brought attention to the gangs, spawning grass-roots movements to rid residential areas of gang headquarters and offices. A Yamaguchi-gumi subgang in the central Japanese city of <LOCATION> Hamamatsu </LOCATION> was in the media spotlight until public opposition forced it to relocate last year. The gang is now on the verge of collapse, according to <PERSON> Ishii </PERSON> of the crime control office. But <PERSON> Masafumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueda </PERSON>, director of the office, said in an interview that the public outcry and tough police crackdowns also may have worked to the syndicate's benefit, putting many smaller gangs out of business or forcing them to seek Yamaguchi-gumi protection. A recent issue of `` Endless Advance,'' an in-house journal published by the <ORGANIZATION> Kyokuto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shinsei-kai </ORGANIZATION>, a large <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> syndicate, attested to the trend toward consolidation. In the 120-page edition obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> were photos of top underworld figures gathered for dinner at a posh <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> hotel to `` pursue friendly relations and cooperation'' and avoid intergang trouble. Technically, the Yamaguchi-gumi has only 86 members, but each of the top 86 controls a network of subordinate gangs, which, in turn, have their own `` kasa'' _ Japanese for umbrella. Top bosses rarely face prosecution for serious crimes as underlings take responsibility, sometimes even turning themselves in, since doing prison time can bring a promotion. According to an annual report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, more than 86,000 gangsters in 3,201 gangs are spread across the country. Roughly 40 percent belong to the big three nationwide syndicates _ the Yamaguchi-gumi, the Tokyo-based Sumiyoshi Rengo-kai and the <LOCATION> Inagawa-kai </LOCATION>, also based in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ueda </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> estimated total underworld income at the yen equivalent of $ 15 billion annually, but he added that `` is only a rough guess.'' Yamaguchi-gumi income sources include gambling, the protection racket, fraud, prostitution, money laundering and narcotics. These and countless other scams are backed up by front operations in construction, the stock market and real estate. Police believe the deaths of <PERSON> Hiroyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> and his boss, <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kengaku </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> stock market speculator, are shadier examples of what the Yamaguchi-gumi has done. The bodies of the men, who police allege had been kidnapped and held for ransom, were dug up Oct. 18 _ entombed in a slab of concrete. Two Yamaguchi-gumi affiliate members later confessed to the crime. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Kobe </PERSON> residents seem to accept the Yamaguchi-gumi's presence with a mixture of helplessness and inevitability `` I've never had any trouble with gangsters, but I suppose I'd prefer it if they'd leave,'' said a taxi driver `` The thing is, you'll never get rid of them.''

<BYLINE>European Lynx Brought Back To French Mountains</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>THANNENKIRCH, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the spectacularly beautiful <LOCATION> Vosges </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> of eastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, half a dozen Czechoslovak lynxes roaming the forest are the seed of a new population struggling for survival against nature and man. For most of the people in this region of low mountains west of the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, reintroduction of the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> lynx into an area from which it disappeared in the 19th century is a wonderful thing. `` But you only need two or three -LRB- people -RRB- against it, if those two or three have rifles,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbier </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Protection of Nature. Perhaps only 3,000 to 3,500 European lynxes are left on the Continent, and nearly all of them are in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, says <PERSON> Veronique </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrenschmidt </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s lynx reintroduction program. Of the 12 lynxes released in the <LOCATION> Vosges </LOCATION> in the past five years, only six are alive, and perhaps not that many. It's difficult to know now because the transmitter collars have ceased to function. Some lynxes have been shot, either for sport or out of anger. One was a female whose two young then died; others have just disappeared. Early next year, one last effort will be made. It's the final cast of the dice for Miss Herrenschmidt, the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunting </ORGANIZATION> and Wild Fauna and the World Wildlife Fund, all participating in the program. Six more lynxes have been reserved in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and are being held there until the end of the French hunting season in January. They then will be brought here, acclimated and freed. `` We have n't won yet,'' said <PERSON> Barbier </PERSON>. `` This is double or nothing. We are going to put six more in and if that does n't work we'll have to rethink the whole program.'' Success, according to <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrenschmidt </PERSON>, a 32-year-old agricultural engineer with a doctorate in ecology, `` will be when there is reproduction in the <LOCATION> Vosges </LOCATION> and those lynxes themselves become adult. Maybe in two or three years.'' Opposition comes essentially from some hunters and farmers. Hunters claim lynxes reduce the game population, particularly the beautiful and tasty <LOCATION> Vosges </LOCATION> roe deer, and farmers worry about their sheep. This region is mostly mountainous forest or vineyards, with few sheep, so farmers are less of a problem. Even so, the World Wildlife Fund reimburses farmers for the loss of domestic animals proven to have been killed by lynxes, a protected species. Usually, there is no mystery. A lynx's kill is a signature. `` It's always the same,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrenschmidt </PERSON>. `` He kills by strangling, biting his prey in the throat.'' In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where virtually every square foot of huntable land is parceled out and leased, often at incredibly high prices, hunters have a very proprietary view of wild game. Any reduction of roe deer, for example, means fewer for the hunters to shoot. Nonetheless, the majority of hunters support the program. `` We accepted the reintroduction of the lynx on condition that if it becomes prolific it will be opened for hunting,'' said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Turckheim </PERSON>, president of the Hunting Federation of the Lower Rhine. `` Here the price of hunting leases is very expensive,'' he said. `` Hunters have the right to question anything that affects the level of game population.'' Ecologists like <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrenschmidt </PERSON> would argue that the lynxes provide a service by culling out the weak, unfit animals, which in the long run leads to a better, healthier deer. Like their predecessors, the new lynxes will be taken to a site high in the <LOCATION> Vosges </LOCATION>, kept in large cages in the forest and fed wild rabbits. After a month or two, the cages will be opened. The scientific aspect of the lynx program is to study the role of `` superpredators'' in the ecosystem of the area. `` This was seen as an experiment with the idea of introducing the lynx into other zones in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>,'' Miss <PERSON> Herrenschmidt </PERSON> said, adding that the <LOCATION> Vosges </LOCATION> are ideal because each lynx needs about 75,000 to 125,000 acres, though zones may overlap. `` They have all they need to feed and reproduce,'' she added. `` The only problem is they must be respected _ and that means by man. `` The lynx must become a species like any other, like a deer or a wild boar. The lynx must become integrated in the French forest.''

 AL-SEEB, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ `` Hut, hut,'' the young jockeys screeched, whipping their camels with bamboo sticks as <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>'s National Day races started with a dozen `` ships of the desert'' thundering off at a long-legged lope. Trainers and relatives of the diminutive jockeys, 5 to 14 years old, roar down the side of the track in four-wheel-drive pickup trucks and Toyotas, screaming instructions, yelling their riders on in a cacophony of noise. Halfway down the two-mile, arrow-straight track 25 miles west of the capital <LOCATION> Muscat </LOCATION>, senior government officials and sheiks dressed in pristine white robes lounge in an open-sided tent sipping cardoman-scented Arabic coffee and iced soft drinks served on silver platters as the camels gallop past. There is no betting. It's forbidden in Islamic <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. But there is prestige for the owners of winning camels, specially bred as racing steeds. Camel racing, once little more than a desert pastime, has become a big sport in <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and the other Arab states on the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, patronized by the region's billionaire princes and sheiks. Racing camels sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars. An Omani breeder, <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Malki </PERSON>, earlier this year sold a throughbred female racer to a sheik in the neighboring <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> for a record $ 155,000. Wealthy Arabs are spending millions of dollars in breeding racing camels and in prize money during the November-April season, when the searing desert temperatures cool to a tolerable 95 degrees. Prizes can be as high as $ 250,000 in some of the bigger meets, particularly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. In one race in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> recently, some 600 camels took part. The sport has given camels a new lease of life. With the helter-skelter modernization brought by the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>'s oil riches, camels have largely become obselete as beasts of burden or transportation in a region where just about everyone drives a car or pickup. Once camels were also the Bedouin nomads' source of milk, hides and often food. But even this has disappeared as many desert dwellers moved to the towns. Some sheiks provide subsidies for camel breeders. <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>'s National Day races do n't come near matching the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION>. The camels and their trainers, handlers and jockeys, who are dressed in ragged robes or colored track suits, squat in the sand at one end of the track, waiting their turn to race, hurling good-natured insults at each other. A white-robed steward named <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, curved Omani dagger in his ornate silver belt, tried to maintain order while keeping in touch with the finish line through a squalking walkie-talkie. The runners are selected. The handlers strap in the boy jockeys behind the camels' humps with cloth straps and velcro pads so they wo n't be hurled off. The starter's gun cracks and a dozen camels stampede from the starting line. The handlers have to be agile to get out the way of the forest of hooves. One middle-aged man was a little too slow and was trampled. Stunned and shaken, but apparently with no broken bones, he was carried to an ambulance. Sometimes, the jockeys do fall off. But they hit the ground with a roll that a paratrooper would be proud of. There are bumps and bruises, but no serious injuries.

 When <PERSON> Marlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> accompanied her husband <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last year, she had more in mind than sightseeing in Red Square. The trip gave her the idea for what will be the first Soviet-American co-production of an entertainment show, her special `` Free To Be ... A Family,'' airing Wednesday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's an entertainment exchange between kids and superstar performers from this country and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` We present our favorite performers and they present theirs. It's a fun show of comedy and song, but the show also challenges destructive stereotypes about families. `` Our goal is to show children that every family, no matter who's in it or where they live, is a real family as long as its members nurture and love each other `` We also talk about the global family. It's no longer ` we' and ` they,' we have to start thinking of ` us.' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> talks about feeding the entire world with one turkey and how big it was would have to be. <PERSON> Carly </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> sings the song that became our theme, ` Turn of the Tide.' It says we are the turn of the tide and we have to speak up.'' The one-hour special is a sequel to `` Free To Be ... You and Me,'' which won <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> and Emmy awards in 1974. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> made arrangements for the special while her husband was taping a week's worth of his syndicated talk show `` Donahue'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Free To Be ... A Family'' was put together later by means of a satellite hookup between the <LOCATION> Hard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cafe </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gosteleradio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> is host of the special in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tatiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedeneyeva </PERSON> is host in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Among the American performers are rock group <PERSON> Bon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovi </PERSON>, actress <PERSON> Whoopi </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, comic magicians <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> and Teller, singer-songwriter <PERSON> Carly </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, comedians <PERSON> Lily </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, and Muppets Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. `` We started work on the special last September,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. `` It was very complicated to put together. This is the first jointly produced American-Soviet entertainment program. ... We have 40 Soviet kids and 40 American kids, and we sing over the ` space bridge' satellite. The kids were selected a year ago and got to know each other by exchanging letters and photos.'' A `` Free To Be ... A Family'' book was published in 1987, and half a million copies have been sold. An album featuring many of the stars on the special was issued last month. `` Soviet rock star <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Prezhnikof </PERSON> is on the show. I was surprised to learn the Russians dance to the same dance steps we do and know more about us than we know about them. They know all of our rock stars and see our movies.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the first project, `` Free To Be ... You and Me'' was an attempt to rewrite children's literature to eliminate sexual and ethnic stereotypes. `` There were too many stories about Prince Charming coming along and carrying the girl off,'' she said. `` I wanted to liberate the definition of boy and girl the way we had liberated the definition of men and women. The new book liberates the definition of the family and expands its meaning.'' With the special completed, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> is now on to other things. She's just completed a comedy-mystery called `` In the Spirit.'' It co-stars <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> plays a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> wife, and I'm a New Age health food store owner who thinks all the world's problems would be solved if people would just stop eating meat,'' she said. `` We're being chased by someone who thinks we know about a murder.'' Next, she will star in a feature film for Twentieth Century-Fox called `` A Point of Light.'' It's a story of a rural family and probably will be filmed in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. She will also co-star with her father, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, in a CBS drama called `` Deception.'' She said, `` We play father and daughter,'' he said. `` We look alike so what else could we play?''

<HEAD>Portable Phones are All the Rage in Hong Kong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The rage of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> these days is easy to spot. Just look for the tiny antennas, the telltale sign of the portable telephones so many people are carrying wherever they go. Despite price tags of $ 2,000 or more, the hand-held telephones have become a huge hit in this British colony, where doing business is a 24-hour preoccupation and new status symbols are always in demand. Downtown streets are filled with professionals ready for business with the cellular phones tucked under their arms or stuffed, antenna-up, into briefcases. Away from the financial district, people can be seen barking into the phones while eating in restaurants, riding public buses and ferries, or sitting in darkened movie theaters. Everyone from executives to proprietors of produce stalls can be seen chatting away. The <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> newspaper spotted a telephone in a recent 100-kilometer -LRB- 62-mile -RRB- charity walk along a rural trail. `` In driving rain and a lashing wind, a young man was spotted eagerly and conspicuously talking into his mobile telephone,'' it said. `` In a more normal society one would expect -LRB- him -RRB- to hand the phone over to one of his seconds before starting the race. -LRB- But -RRB- a few kilometers down the track, the young man was spotted merrily informing the financial markets at large of his continued existence.'' The government estimates about 60,000 portable cellular telephones _ roughly six times earlier projections _ will be in use by the end of the year in this territory of 5.7 million people, said Deputy Postmaster General <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, whose department is in charge of telecommunications. While most cellular telephones sold in other countries are for use in cars, roughly three-fourths of the units sold in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> since the market opened three years ago have been the more expensive handheld models. `` We were amazed when the whole thing really took off in a great way,'' Wise said. <ORGANIZATION> Hutchison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>, which has sold about 26,000 cellular telephones, recently stopped sales for six weeks because demand was outpacing the company's capacity to handle all the calls. `` The market just caught everybody by surprise,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a rival firm `` We're all frantically rebuilding networks,'' <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui </PERSON>, a psychology lecturer at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the popularity of the telephones here in part to `` the importance of face It's a status symbol.'' Wise believes the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> work ethic of doing business whenever and wherever possible is largely responsible for the tremendous sales. `` Virtually the whole day is part of the working day,'' he said. Although industry officials see no end in sight to demand for the telephones, their indiscriminate use in public places already is viewed as an irritation by some. `` People are becoming aware of the annoyance factor,'' acknowledged <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. Several exclusive clubs demand that their patrons and guests check their telephones at the door.

<HEAD>ROCKLAND, Maine: PTSD units.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Thus far, however, the government has refused to commit its own resources, forcing <PERSON> Rheault </PERSON> to raise $ 40,000 to $ 50,000 a year from veterans' organizations, foundations, corporations and individual donors. He has appeared before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and regularly speaks at PTSD conferences, hopeful that the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> will eventually embrace the program as an effective means of helping the war's psychological casualties, most of whom are now in their early 40s. `` They're on a knife edge,'' <PERSON> Rheault </PERSON> says. `` If they fall off on one side, they'll be OK. If they fall off on the other side, they'll be alcoholics, bums, suicides, jailbirds or long-term mental patients _ at a tremendous cost to society. The Outward Bound course is demanding, he says, but those who complete it are more likely to progress than those who remain institutionalized throughout their treatment. While there is no scientific data on the effectiveness of the program, the director of psychiatry at the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION> says participation in Outward Bound has been shown to make patients more amenable to other aspects of the treatment process. PTSD patients are distrustful, aloof and unable to interact with others, Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Boutelle </PERSON> explains, citing a symptom known as `` emotional numbing.'' `` It's as if there is Novocain in their emotions,'' he says. The courses, <PERSON> Boutelle </PERSON> says, re-create the camaraderie and mutual dependence shared by soldiers during combat, encouraging the veterans to open up to each other as they sit around a campfire and share their successes and failures during the climb. <PERSON> Rheault </PERSON> blames institutionalized bureaucracy within the VA for the slow pace at which the program is being accepted. `` If, during all of this time, I had merely been butting my head against the brick wall of the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>, I would have given up long ago,'' he says. `` But while we were waiting for the glacier to move, we have helped vets.'' At <LOCATION> VA </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a spokeswoman said a study is under way among patients at the <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> centers to gauge the effectiveness of patient participation in Outward Bound. `` The veterans who are involved in the program have very positive feelings about it, but no one has done a study to determine the therapeutic effect of it, and that is what they are doing right now,'' said the spokeswoman, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>. Positive changes in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s attitude toward <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans, many of whom were greeted with hostility or indifference when they first returned home, have created a climate of greater acceptance and a willingness to deal with such lingering problems as post-traumatic stress, according to <PERSON> Rheault </PERSON>. The Vietnam War Memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he said, was part of a symbolic change in which `` the people were able to separate the war from the warrior.'' `` On balance, it is a more accepting society, and the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> vets now dare say they were there, and that's OK,'' he says. <PERSON> Rheault </PERSON>'s belief in the war waned as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military buildup peaked during the late 1960s, pushing counter-insurgency efforts to the background and de-emphasizing the social, economic, political and psychological aspects of the struggle. The turning point came when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops shifted from an advisory role and became the chief defenders of the <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> regime, he says. `` Interestingly, in 1964-65 nobody called Vietnamese ` gooks.' But by 1968, everybody did,'' he says. To <PERSON> Rheault </PERSON>, the rigorous climb up the mountain while shouldering heavy packs typifies the trail the veterans must take if they are to overcome their deep-seated problems. The climb is deliberately evocative of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> experience, placing squad-size groups of veterans in an unfamiliar wilderness environment where they help and encourage each other to reach the top. `` I maintain that the war was evil, stupid and immoral, but their experience as human beings _ experiences of courage, self-sacrifice and brotherhood _ that was all valid stuff,'' <PERSON> Rheault </PERSON> says. `` The mountain is a great metaphor. You climb it a step at a time. You ca n't see the mountain. You can only see a few feet of the trail. `` If you could see the whole mountain, it would be too intimidating to climb. But since you can only see a little bit of it, you take a few steps. And eventually, you're up there.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ As late as the 1930s, about two in five Jordanians were nomadic Bedouins. Today the government estimates the number at less than one in 20. While many Bedouins still refuse to abandon their culture, the lure of modern conveniences and government services is putting the brakes on a society that has been on the move for thousands of years.

<TEXT>
 A way of life 6,000 years old is fading away in the Arabian desert as nomadic Bedouin tribesmen settle down. Today's `` ships of the desert'' are trucks, not camels. `` It is dying, and it's a shame,'' says <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Trad </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Shaalan </PERSON>, leaning against a pillow in a woven tent open to a sprawling vista of the barren Jordanian desert. <PERSON> Shaalan </PERSON> is a leader of the <LOCATION> Rwallah </LOCATION> tribe, which has roamed for hundreds of years across land now divided by the borders of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. Of some 200,000 Rwallah clansmen, `` I would say less than 5 percent are still moving, even less than that,'' the sheik says. <PERSON> Shaalan </PERSON> says perhaps a third of them are partly nomadic, the women or children living in town while the husband lives in a tent and follows the herds of goats and sheep. As <PERSON> Shaalan </PERSON> speaks, about 100 camels slowly glide by in the distance, led by a Rwallah tribesman. <PERSON> Shalaan </PERSON>'s own four-wheel drive vehicle with custom wheel rims is parked beside the tent, not far from the perch of two tethered hunting falcons. The camel has become more a status symbol than a necessity. Today trucks kick up plumes of dust over the hard-floored Jordanian desert miles from any roads. They carry water, livestock and tents from one site to another, making it easier for Bedouins to reach their herds from fixed campsites or villages, many of which have sprung up around wells and schools provided by governments throughout the region. Greater mobility and government services have encouraged the Bedouins to settle _ as have a long drought and the problems of crossing borders. `` As people are able to travel farther, they do n't have to move as much in terms of their residences,'' says <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tulsa </ORGANIZATION> paleontologist who has lived among modern-day Bedouins in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> while studying their ancestors. `` Women always like to get away from the hardship of living in a tent and moving every day or every week and having to collect branches for cooking fires,'' <PERSON> Shaalan </PERSON> says. `` They prefer to be living in a house with electricity and gas ovens and to have bread coming from the bakery.'' Um <PERSON> Khader </PERSON>, a Bedouin woman in the hills south of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> agrees. `` Oh lord, how I love the cement house,'' she says. `` I'm rid of the dust.'' About two in five Jordanians were nomadic Bedouins in the 1920s and 1930s. Today, the government estimates that less than one in 20 still follows the old way of life. `` I think what you're seeing is the last of the Mohicans,'' says <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> political scientist who led a survey of Bedouins in the late 1970s. `` It never crossed my mind to leave the tent and live in a house,'' says <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Guesam </PERSON>. `` I like the freedom. I like the peace. I want to die in this black tent.'' But like many Bedouins, <PERSON> al-Guesam </PERSON> says he keeps his children in a nearby town, where they can go to school. Two have already graduated and joined the army, a favored occupation for a martial people who once treated raiding as a sort of sport. Inside his black goat-hair tent, the sheik offers visitors the cardamon-spiced Bedouin coffee and repeated cups of sugary tea from pots kept steaming on the fragrant bed of coals before him. A pet cat stalks out from behind a bamboo screen that sets off the women's quarters within. The sound of small children giggling and chatting drifts through the reeds. <PERSON> Shaalan </PERSON>, in addition to his tent, has a house in remote Al-Feida and sends his children to school in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, where he says they are closer to health care and other services. <PERSON> Shaalan </PERSON> himself studied management at <ORGANIZATION> Biscayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school since renamed <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> says nomadic herders broke away into the desert from small farming settlements in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> some 6,000 years ago, although it is unclear if those ancient people were the same as today's Bedouins. Even so, he says, `` It's just uncanny the number of parallels you see between 6,000-year-old camps and the ones you see occupied today.'' Camels arrived perhaps 2,000 to 1,500 B.C., making it possible for the nomads to range farther into the arid expanses of Arabia. Scholars say the Bedouins have developed a complex and sophisticated culture while living beyond the reach of governments. Their complicated system of unwritten laws, based on intensely felt honor and hospitality, operates even today alongside formal laws. Crimes such as murder or rape once could lead to bloodshed and still often today require restitution to the victim _ an element often missing in Western law. <PERSON> Shaalan </PERSON> says the offenders also might be banished from the tribe, a stiff penalty in a society where identity is based on the clan. For lesser crimes, a man `` would be disgraced, not be presented with a cup of coffee in a group like this ... His sister would not be married to a dignified person,'' <PERSON> Shaalan </PERSON> says. But the sheik says the old ways are eroding as Bedouins settle. `` Living in a city has made people lose a great deal of their dignity, generosity, truth in dealings ... They have acquired the bad habits of the city,'' <PERSON> Shaalan </PERSON> complains. In the city, `` people are becoming very busy, so generosity is lost ... You ca n't just come to a tent and enter and whoever is there serves you food and coffee.'' <PERSON> Shaalan </PERSON> compares Bedouin virtues to those of rural Americans. `` I really felt as if I was in a Bedouin society when I was in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> in the country, when I was in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> close to the <LOCATION> Smokey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>,'' he says. `` When I went to the big cities, I felt like I was in a jungle.'' Bedouin values, even weakened, continue to permeate Arab society. Hospitality is prized. Families are tight, and behavior is bound by codes of honor. Consensus is preferred to majority rule. `` I'm fairly convinced that being Bedouin is not a way of life at all. Its a political ideology,'' says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON>, a British anthropologist who spent several years living with the Rwallah.

 There are no yellow brick roads or wicked witches in this <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> retirement community, but there is a fugitive from the land of Oz. He's a Munchkin, name of <PERSON> Meinhardt </PERSON> <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON>. Although it's been half a century, <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON> can still repeat the lines he sang as the Munchkin coroner in `` The Wizard of Oz,'' the 1939 movie classic starring <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>. When the tornado dropped the house on the wicked witch, it was <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON>, carrying a large death certificate, who sang, `` She's not only merely dead, she's most sincerely dead.'' The coroner had one of the nine speaking roles for the 116 little people who played Munchkins in the movie based on <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>'s books At the time the movie was filmed, <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON> was promoting <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> wieners as `` Little Oscar _ The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s Smallest Chef.'' He took a two-month leave of absence and headed for <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, where he was given the role in `` The Wizard Of Oz.'' <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON> was 22 years old and only 46 inches tall. He had worked his way through college in midget shows at fairs. He's since grown to 4-foot-7. When the film was made, <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON> says he had no idea it would become a classic. He was only familiar with the scenes in which he played. `` We did n't know what came before or what came after,'' he says. `` We had no idea what the picture was all about until we saw it released. `` At the time of its release, it was overshadowed by ` Gone With The Wind.''' `` Gone With The Wind'' won four Academy Awards, including best picture that year. `` It was only after CBS got the film in 1956 and used it for their promotions that it became as well known,'' he says. Now retired and living in this community established by <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON>, 73, believes the movie has become an enduring classic because people saw it as children and still remember it. `` That's one factor, but the second basic factor is there is nothing in the picture that dates it,'' he says. `` There are no old vintage cars or old vintage streetcars and it's a fantasy picture that will be fantasy for generations to come. `` I have so many middle-aged people come up to me and say, ` I just bought the video of `` The Wizard of Oz'' for my grandchildren.' But after talking to them, you realize that it was they themselves who were most interested because it was nostalgia for them.'' Although <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON> leads an active life as the horticulturist at <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, he and his wife, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, often travel to Oz reunions, including a recent one in <LOCATION> Chesterton </LOCATION>, Ind. `` One of the reasons why the Munchkins are getting attention is that all the major stars of the picture are gone, so there are just a few of us Munchkins left,'' <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON> says. There are fewer than 30 former Munchkins still living. `` It was 50 years ago and I was one of the younger ones,'' he says. `` Many of them were 30 and 40 years older than I was at time.'' <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON> says being involved in the movie was the experience of a lifetime. `` For a young man of 22 from a farm in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to be in that atmosphere was naturally a big thrill,'' <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON> said. He got to meet <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> and many of the other top stars at <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>. When the little people chosen to play Munchkins were hired, each was measured for a costume. While the costumes were made, the Munchkins rehearsed their parts. `` As we marched, we had to be on a certain yellow brick on a certain note. We were all well-rehearsed. So when the costumes were finished, we were ready to do the shooting,'' he says. Work began at 6 a.m. each day and continued until 8 p.m. each night. <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON> says he ca n't remember what he was paid for his role in the movie, but remembers it was very low. `` By today's standards, people would say you were crazy to work for that,'' he says. <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION> in 1915, was a member of the <LOCATION> Midget </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> cast at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> World's Fair in 1934. He also performed at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exposition </ORGANIZATION> in 1935 and the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Centennial </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s Fair in 1936. `` By working at these world's fairs as a midget, I was able to work my way through the university,'' <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON> says. He holds both a bachelor's degree in accounting from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> and a master's degree in business administration from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON> says some short people resent the word `` midget,'' but that was the description widely used when he was in show business. `` My wife and I were both in show business, were both midgets. My wife worked from 1929 to 1932 as a member of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s Royal Midgets, the largest midget troupe in vaudeville,'' he says. They have been married for 43 years. When <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON> graduated from college, he was unable to get a job as an accountant because of his size. But his size worked to his advantage when he was hired as `` Little Oscar, the World's Smallest Chef'' _ a job he held for 30 years. <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON>, who wore a chef's uniform, traveled around the country doing cooking shows, school shows, lectures and handing out samples. `` I was on the road all the time, I never had an office job,'' he says. `` We were constantly on the road traveling.'' When `` The Wizard of Oz'' was released in 1939, <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON> performed a double duty. `` I traveled with the picture for six months,'' he says. `` I was being paid by <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>. I was getting the little promotion bit ahead of the picture and we passed out wiener samples in the lobby at the end.''

And if they get an invitation to the writers' colony at <ORGANIZATION> Hedgebrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> on Puget Sound, it wo n't cost them a cent.

 A quaint farm on an island in Puget Sound has been converted into a retreat for women who want to write and think and dream in solitude, beyond the press of family and jobs. The writer's colony at <ORGANIZATION> Hedgebrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>, which began receiving its first authors-in-residence in August, is the creation of <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordhoff </PERSON>, the 56-year-old daughter of a shipping executive who has long been active in community affairs in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area. `` Women need the chance to explore their craft without having to wait until the kids are in college,'' says <PERSON> Nordhoff </PERSON>, a 1954 graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holyoke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hadley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` Women have something important to say, they need to be heard.'' Women writers selected by a screening committee can spend two weeks to two months at Hedgebrook Farm free of charge. <PERSON> Nordhoff </PERSON> bought the farm with her own money _ she declines to say how much _ and foots all the bills. Why? `` It's a gift to myself and to the writers,'' she says. `` It's because I know from my own life the pain of not being affirmed You know, I have the ability, I have the interest to be able to say women deserve to be heard and to be able to do something about it.'' The 30-acre farm, 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Whidbey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, has a remodeled yellow stucco farmhouse and two timber-framed, skylighted cabins, with four others in the works. Every day a picnic basket lunch is delivered to each writer's doorstep, `` with just a loud enough thump so that they know it's there,'' <PERSON> Nordhoff </PERSON> Almost every article in the cabins is hand-crafted, from the porcelain sink basins to the pillows and afghan for curling up next to three ground-level windows. A loft and bed look out stained-glass windows into the trees. None of the cabins' windows faces other cabins. <PERSON> Nordhoff </PERSON> says they were designed that way so writers would feel `` separate, but not isolated.'' The cabins were designed by architect <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> graduate who now designs structures for the Amish in <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. Writers are afforded solitude all day but eat dinner in the farmhouse at a big wooden table looking out over Puget Sound, along with <PERSON> Nordhoff </PERSON> and the `` farm family'' of carpenters, cooks and other friends. `` It's a place where people can work the way they've always wanted to,'' says <PERSON> Sheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Sommerville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, a non-fiction writer. <PERSON> Nordhoff </PERSON> gave up her long career as a community activist to develop the farm. `` It was meetings, meetings, meetings, all the time,'' <PERSON> Nordhoff </PERSON> says. `` Too much formality and ritual.'' <PERSON> Nordhoff </PERSON> had been instrumental in forming the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION> volunteer bureau. She also served on <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Overlake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> board and was president of the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nordhoff </PERSON> says that after traveling around the country in a van, she realized she felt most at home in the country, with her hands in the dirt. She bought the farm as `` something for me,'' and as something she wanted to share. <PERSON> Nordhoff </PERSON>, who now grows vegetables in her Hedgebrook garden, co-wrote a book on fund-raising for non-profit organizations. But she says she does n't consider herself a writer. She says the idea for <PERSON> Hedgebrook </PERSON> came from a visit to the McDowell writers' colony in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. She liked the colony, which is for published writers, but wondered where people who had n't published anything could go `` The idea for <PERSON> Hedgebrook </PERSON> became attractive to me,'' <PERSON> Nordhoff </PERSON> says. `` A place where I could say, ` I care about women writers and support what you are doing _ even if you have n't been published.''' A selection committee composed of five writers recommended to <PERSON> Nordoff </PERSON> by bookstore owners, English professors and librarians, screens the applicants. Two of the five are men. <PERSON> Nordhoff </PERSON> says they look for women who are dedicated to being a writer. `` We want people who ca n't not write,'' she says. An applicant must submit a sample of her writing and a letter saying why she feels a stay at Hedgebrook Farm would be important for her work. Letters from women have been pouring into Hedgebrook: `` I have seven children and there has n't been much opportunity for quiet in my life,'' wrote a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> woman who wants to write poetry. A 42-year-old counselor for disabled people in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> wrote: `` I have been writing poetry since I was a teen-ager. For a long time I put my work as a counselor first, but now I realize I need to nurture parts of me I had previously set aside.'' Although <PERSON> Nordhoff </PERSON> started out advertising mainly through local networks, she is now receiving applications from all over the country. She hopes to eventually accept writers from different locations, but for now is focusing on writers from the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>. Fourteen writers were in residence at some time during the first session that ended Dec. 10. The next session, which runs from Jan. 10 to June 30, can accommodate 18. Residents have included <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Barringer </PERSON>, a published poet from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, who used her stay to finish a second book of poems. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, who stayed for a month, used her time to pull together a book of poems and write several short stories. A science-fiction writer finished a couple of chapters. Writers choose how long they want to stay _ anywhere from a week to two months. `` I feel fortunate to be able to do this,'' <PERSON> Nordhoff </PERSON> says. `` Helping an artist do her work _ that's the joy.''

 <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> has six Emmys for two of the best TV shows ever. She is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fame </ORGANIZATION> and is co-founder of a studio that has made her one of the wealthiest women in television. She has nothing left to prove in her trade. Yet, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> is back in the trenches with a new <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> show called `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>.'' The show is near the bottom of the weekly <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> ratings, along with `` The <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show,'' a new effort by her former co-star in `` The <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show'' in the 1960s. She's struggling to survive in a ratings war that has changed radically since she reigned in the 1970s with `` The <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show.'' Independent stations, syndicated shows, cable, pay channels, video cassettes and the upstart <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> are all relatively new combatants in the ratings war. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, now mired ingloriously in third place, no longer brags that it's the <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. `` You ca n't run away from it because it's tough,'' says <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, whose last situation comedy, `` <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>,'' and two attempts at a variety show failed. `` Acting is what I do for a living. By that, I mean I live to act. As long as I'm healthy enough I want to find a medium to express myself. I hope to be playing old ladies in the near future. `` It has nothing to do with money. It has to do with the joy one has in plying one's trade. This is fun for me. It's rewarding.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> obviously does not need the money. She's quite wealthy from the sale of <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, which she co-founded with former husband <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinker </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s TVS. She retains a 20 percent ownership. Eight years ago she moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the stage play `` Whose Life Is It, Anyway?,'' then decided to stay. She has been married for the past five years to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cardiologist, Dr. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. They also have a home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Duchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> says she has discovered such pastimes as gardening, walking and horseback riding. `` I've become almost bucolic,'' she says. Still, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who professes she gets homesick for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the instant she crosses the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, is back in <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> doing another sitcom. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, wearing a red warm-up suit with her hair cut stylishly short, is sitting on a couch in her trailer parked outside Stage 3 at the <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>. It's the same trailer she used for `` The <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show'' and was also once used by <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>. Up close, despite her diabetic condition and too many years spent exposing her skin to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sun, she looks as good as her bank account. She credits this to a change in lifestyle. She has quit smoking, does light impact aerobics and has adopted a healthier diet. In `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> is a woman who works for the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president, has a teen-age son and remarries a structural engineer with a son and daughter. She has a mother -LRB- <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckart </PERSON> -RRB- who's an ultra-liberal activist, and her new husband -LRB- <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arndt </PERSON> -RRB- has a father -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> -RRB- who's a staunch conservative. The stories are a little different from the usual sitcom fare. In one show she's held up by a man in a wheelchair, then feels obligated to find him a job. In another, her husband admits to having had an affair with his late wife's sister. Once, she had to clear her father-in-law's reputation from an old accusation that food poisoning in his restaurant cost <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> the presidency. `` We're breaking a few molds,'' she says. `` We do some outlandish things and conduct ourselves like adults having a great time.'' It's <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s first one-camera show without an audience since she displayed only her legs as `` Sam'' on `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>, Private Detective,'' in 1959. She says she finds it a much easier way to work. `` CBS had asked me to come back and do another series after the last attempt failed,'' she says. `` We wanted <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoenman </PERSON>, who had been on ` The Cosby Show,' to create the show. We talked over various concepts for about a year. `` We did miscast a very talented actor -LRB- <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> -RRB- as my husband. He was replaced by <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arndt </PERSON>. And the first show turned out a little broader than what we had in mind. But that's what <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> saw and this put us in at 8:30 p.m. after <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>'s new show, which is very broad.'' The writers strike gave them time to think it over. The first show was scrapped and the first show on the air was actually the second show. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> says she wants CBS to move the show because she feels its adult content deserves a later time slot. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> realizes it's impossible to avoid comparisons to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, her character in `` The <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show.'' `` But <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> is radically different from <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>,'' she says. `` Annie's more mature, more creative and not as compulsive. She can have a wrinkle in her skirt or a stain on her blouse. <PERSON> Annie </PERSON>'s a care-giver, she gives of herself to other people. She's not terribly organized She's a little cynical. She's free-spirited.

 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchand </PERSON> can speak with authority about very proper WASP matrons. `` I know a lot of those ladies,'' says the actress who grew up in an upper middle-class family in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` The way they lived is the way I lived.'' Proper is how many audiences view Miss <PERSON> Marchand </PERSON>, too, from her role as the no-nonsense, wealthy, newspaper publisher <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pynchon </PERSON> on television's `` <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'' to the befuddled mayor in this season's surprise movie success `` The Naked Gun'' to her latest stage role, an upper-crust matriarch with a fierce family loyalty in the off-Broadway hit, `` The Cocktail Hour.'' The play, written by A.R. Gurney, gets its title from that particular time of day, usually before dinner, when drinks and good conversation are served. But in this case, the conversation is not so agreeable. A son has returned home to ask his parents' permission to present a play he has written about them. Miss <PERSON> Marchand </PERSON> plays the mother, a peacemaker who tries to soften the generational squabbles, and she walked off with glowing notices from the critics. The actress has worked before with <PERSON> Gurney </PERSON>, who also comes from <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> and from the same upper-class WASP society. It's a society <PERSON> Gurney </PERSON> has written about before in such plays as `` The Dining Room,'' `` The Middle Ages'' and `` The Perfect Party.'' `` Often when a playwright is writing a play, there comes a point when he wants to hear it,'' says <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchand </PERSON>, sitting in the living room of her Upper West Side apartment. `` So I've done a lot of readings of his plays. And when I read ` The Cocktail Hour,' I thought, ` It's the best play he's written.''' The actress knew she had to play this woman and drew the character from her memories of other women, her mother and even herself. But do n't ask her to explain how. `` This is very hard for me to talk about because it's all kind of subliminal,'' she says with a laugh. `` What I do is sit down right away and learn the role. That's when I make a lot of discoveries about the character I get so involved that I become that person. I know that sounds silly, but I really do.'' For Miss <PERSON> Marchand </PERSON>, `` The Cocktail Hour'' has turned into particularly gratifying employment. It will keep her in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for a while. For much of her career, she needed to travel for work. Still she has managed to maintain what she calls `` a real household'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It includes her husband, actor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparer </PERSON>, recently seen off-Broadway as the father in the hit play `` A <PERSON> Shayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Maidel </PERSON>.'' The couple raised three children, now grown. Even when she was filming `` <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'' in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, Miss <PERSON> Marchand </PERSON> was able to shoot most of her scenes in one day and come back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the remainder of the week. `` My husband was here and my youngest daughter was just finishing up high school,'' she says. `` This is my home. But the producers were very good to me.'' Miss <PERSON> Marchand </PERSON> also had the luck of appearing in what was a quality television show. `` The topics that it dealt with were interesting and thought-provoking,'' she says. `` So it was a challenge for me.'' So was the character. In one episode early in the series' run, Mrs. <PERSON> Pynchon </PERSON> had a stroke, Miss <PERSON> Marchand </PERSON> recalls. The illness gave her an opportunity to explore the character further. She began using a cane for the role, something she carried over to later episodes, and then added other stroke-related characteristics to the woman's personality, like her having trouble remembering things. For most of her career, Miss <PERSON> Marchand </PERSON> has had to juggle family and career. There were stretches of 12-hour days when husband and wife never stopped running between family and career, particularly when they both were members of the APA-Phoenix repertory company in the 1960s. `` After working five or six hours rehearsing, then rushing home and getting dinner on the table and listening to problems about trigonometry or getting kids bathed and ready for bed, it cleaned out that period of time for me emotionally,'' she recalls. `` I could go back to the theater fresh and ready to do a show.'' It was good for the children, too. ` It made them more independent and helped them get along together,'' she says. Now they have left home and she can concentrate on her career. `` I love the work so I'm not averse to doing something that is n't necessarily going to reflect my 35 years in the business,'' she says A year ago, she was Klytemnestra in a production of `` Elektra'' by <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Pound </PERSON> at a miniscule off-off-Broadway theater for a miniscule salary. `` If it interests me, I'll do it.'' Right now, she still is fascinated by `` The Cocktail Hour,'' striving to make the production and her performance better. `` Although it's a play of language, it's economical,'' she says. `` Because language is so specific, you ca n't fool around with the words, changing them or changing the syntax because you will change the rhythm and often change the meaning. That is the hardest thing to do _ to get the words absolutely perfect. `` The woman I play is very smart about dealing with the rhythms of the family,'' Miss <PERSON> Marchand </PERSON> says. `` Quite early on in the play, she says, ` I want to know what I missed,' and discovers what she missed was not very good. So she immediately drops it and then picks up and approaches it from a totally different point of view. But it's all done, I hope, as smooth as silk. She calms the waters.''

 `` Rain Man'' The autistic savant syndrome has been used to describe `` a spectacular skill or talent that occurs in an autistic or retarded child.'' It might seem a likely subject for a disease-of-the-month television movie. Instead, it is the theme of a motion picture, `` Rain Man,'' which is the most original and compelling American drama since `` One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' Yes, it's a drama, though, as in `` Cuckoo,'' there are hearty laughs. Essentially it's the saga of two long-lost brothers seeking a reconciliation against heavy odds. Cruise is a rapacious wheeler-dealer trying to make a bundle by importing sports cars in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. His major deal is interrupted by news that his father, from whom he was long estranged, has died in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. Cruise attends the funeral and learns he has been disinherited. His father's $ 3 million estate has been placed in trust. But for whom? Cruise is astounded to learn that he has an older brother, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, who has been institutionalized most of his life. Cruise decides to virtually kidnap the brother and fight the will in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> may seem like an automaton, but he has a superhuman way with numbers. This pays off at the blackjack table in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. That helps ameliorate <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON>'s rage, and he begins to understand and cope with his brother. No good to give away all the plot. Suffice to say that the inspired script by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> -LRB- based on <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>'s story -RRB- offers a wealth of surprises, both comedic and dramatic <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> -LRB- `` Tin Men,'' `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' -RRB- directs in masterful style. It is his best effort in what promises to be a distinguished career. He maintains a beautiful balance between the hard-driving, cynical Cruise and the childlike <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s performance is astounding. He gets inside the skin of <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> and never allows him to become monotonous or pitiable. Cruise, dashing in his `` Risky Business'' shades, carries a heavy load, talking at a fast clip as the car dealer and as the exasperated brother struggling to communicate with <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>. Cruise has emerged as a superb actor as well as teen-age heartthrob. <PERSON> Valerina </PERSON> <PERSON> Golino </PERSON> is excellent as Cruise's understanding girlfriend. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Molen </PERSON> injects humanity into his role as <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>'s guardian <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> produced the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> film which is rated R, mostly for Cruise's expletives.

 `` The Naked Gun'' When was the last time you had some real fun at a movie? If you have to stop and think, then run, do n't walk, to the nearest theater showing, `` The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad.'' Be prepared for a zany, side-splitting collection of gags _ some of them off color and most of them outrageous. And get ready to give your laugh muscles a workout. `` Naked Gun'' is the latest product of those masters of hilarity, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, who gave us the memorable `` Airplane!'' and the not-so-memorable `` Top Secret!'' This time they're parodying one of their own failures, the short lived TV series, `` Police Squad!'' Tried and true <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> is back as the unsmiling klutz of the police world, Lt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Drebin </PERSON>, who smashes police cars into trash cans, gets his hand stuck in a fish tank and falls over his own feet in the pursuit of justice. He's wonderful. <PERSON> Drebin </PERSON>, trying to foil a plot on the life of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, sets off a series of hilarious non-stop gags. For instance, he winds up as the singer of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthem </ORGANIZATION> and the umpire at a major league baseball game where <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> plays an unexpected role as assassin-in-waiting. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>'s direction of these complex sight gags is flawless. <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> is <PERSON> Drebin </PERSON>'s romantic interest, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, whose deadpan delivery is a match for <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>'s. A scene in which the two practice `` safe sex'' in body size condoms is typical of the giggle power of this film. There is a villain, played by a silky <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalban </PERSON>, a bemused sidekick played by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and lots of celebrity cameos as well as a dumpy Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> look-alike. There are no messages here, and the story is just an excuse for some terrific jokes. Call it slapstick. Call it crazy. Call it a hit. `` Naked Gun'' is rated PG-13 for language, double entendres and implied nudity. The very young might wonder why the adults are falling on the floor laughing. _ By <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutsch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Funny Farm'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>; VHS-Beta, $ 89.95; Rated PG -RRB- It takes courage for the makers of a comedy to put the word `` funny'' in the title. Sometimes it's an accurate assessment, as in `` A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' that 1966 bawdy farce starring <PERSON> Zero </PERSON> <PERSON> Mostel </PERSON>. Then again, it might be the kiss of death. And <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> `` Funny Farm'' definitely shows signs of rigor mortis. This Chevy Chase comedy is about as funny as picking cotton on a 103-degree August day. The laughs, such as they are, are forced and the situations predictable. The video reeks of country bumpkin cliches, and <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>, as usual, does a turn or two with <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s Law. What makes this movie an even greater travesty is that it's directed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, who made the very excellent `` Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' and the Academy Award-winning `` The Sting. The thin story line revolves around a writer and his wife who decide to leave the noise, filth and crowds of city life for the bucolic splendors of the country. There our hero hopes to write THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL. Instead, he becomes blocked out of his mind, grows fat and lazy and idles while his wife turns a simple experience with a squirrel into a best-selling children's book. In its theatrical release, `` Funny Farm,'' which co-stars <PERSON> Madolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> -LRB- `` Urban Cowboy,'' `` All of Me'' -RRB-, stayed around for a blink. Perhaps some kind-hearted filmmaker will one day find some decent material for <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>, whose acting talents and comedic genius have been dashed in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. In the meantime, if you want to see this basic plot work well, get the <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION> video, `` Mr. <PERSON> Blandings </PERSON> Builds His Dream House.'' The 1948 black and white comedy stars <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, <PERSON> Myrna </PERSON> <PERSON> Loy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editor </ORGANIZATION>.

 `` Sunset'' -LRB- RCA-Columbia Pictures Home Video; VHS-Beta, $ 89.95; Rated R -RRB- What if <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Earp </PERSON> met <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mix </PERSON>, and the legendary heroes team up to solve a murder and get the bad guys? In <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' `` Sunset,'' the real-life cowboys do indeed get together for what turns out to be a surprisingly delightful romp <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> star as Earp and Mix respectively. It's an interesting pairing that produces just the right screen chemistry. <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> is his usual homey good-guy with just the right amount of laidback seasoning. <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, usually brash and pseudo-hip, plays Mix with a certain reserve and honesty. The time is Hollywood in the 1920s. Mix is the hottest action actor around, and has been cast to portray the great lawman <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Earp </PERSON>. Earp has been hired to be a consultant on the film. Only problem is, the movie is pure Hollywood hogwash and <PERSON> Earp </PERSON>'s character is made to look like a moron. The movie does n't sit too well with Mix, either. So the two heroes soon have a meeting of the minds. Meanwhile, back at the ranch so to speak, the studio boss' wife is an old pal of <PERSON> Earp </PERSON>'s and asks him to help her with a little problem. This tiny problem turns out to involve murder and scandal and is centered on her husband, a venal brute played viciously by <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>. The dialogue from <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' slick screenplay -LRB- based on a story by <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Amateau </PERSON> -RRB- is fresh and funny, and the action and adventure lure us to another time, the glittery golden age of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. And best of all, it's all true _ give or take a lie or two. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editor </ORGANIZATION>.

 `` The Dead'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Vestron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>; VHS-Beta, $ 89.98; Rated PG -RRB- While most of `` The Dead'' takes place at a Christmas party, this is not a video to watch with a bunch of pals and a few beers. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON>'s interpretation of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>'s short story is quiet, powerful and elegant. It requires attention, and you will be rewarded. `` The Dead'' can be funny and sweet, but its lasting impression is a profoundly sad vision of the lack of connection between a husband and wife. The story unravels during a rather proper but entertaining party given annually by two unmarried sisters and their niece in 1904 <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. Among the guests are young lovers, a drunk, a rebellious nationalist woman and the couple, <PERSON> Gretta </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Anjelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> -RRB- and <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Donal </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> -RRB-. <PERSON> Anjelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> is a beautiful and surprisingly authentic Irish woman, tormented by the memory a young man she loved as a teen-ager and who she believes died for her. As those memories slowly are stirred by various events at the party, <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> comes finally to realize `` how poor a part I've played'' in her life His preoccupation with a speech he gives at the party suddenly seems so trivial, and his steadfastness so dreary. Nominated for an Academy Award for best screenplay, by <PERSON> Huston </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, `` The Dead'' was finished just before <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON> died in August 1987 `` The Dead'' is lovely to look at and truly moving. _ By <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> MacVean </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Nelson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>; VHS-Beta, $ 79.98; Rated R -RRB- `` <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'' is a tight, fast-paced, entertaining and ostensibly accurate portrait of the Prohibition-era lawman-turned-gangster who engineered the botched and bloody `` <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massacre </ORGANIZATION>'' trying to spring a pal. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> has the title role of this unpretentious gangster movie. He invests his character with a grace, nobility and charm the real <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> lacked. Filmed mostly on location in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, it's full of nice period costumes and architecture that frame some gorgeous performances, including the brilliant <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waites </PERSON> as <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Ross </PERSON> as brother <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Stock </PERSON> as speakeasy chanteuse <PERSON> Vi </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bright </PERSON> as <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Richetti </PERSON>. Writer-director <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> took some chances with his abrupt montage, but it works: Months pass between some scenes, minutes and seconds between others. Yet each has its own compelling logic on the journey <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is making. On Nov. 29, 1933, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was found shot to death in a ditch outside <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>'s performance is so poised and intense that he can give you the character while withholding his secrets. Ultimately we do n't know <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. But then, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> makes us wish we could. This one's a real find. _ By <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Die Walkuere'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grammaphon </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra Conducted by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. There's no shortage of recordings of <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s `` Die Walkuere'' in the catalog, but the newest version, featuring the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra conducted by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, has been eagerly awaited since the project was announced more than two years ago. For once, the results justify all the excitement. This Deutsche Grammaphon release -LRB- available only on cassette and compact disc -RRB- has got to be high on anybody's list of the best opera recordings of 1988. The cast closely follows the one heard currently at the Met in its new production of <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s four-opera Ring Cycle. That means it's about the best that could be put together from today's singers, although not up to the superhuman standards set by <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agers </ORGANIZATION> such as <PERSON> Flagstad </PERSON> or Melchior, or more recently by <PERSON> Birgit </PERSON> <PERSON> Nilsson </PERSON>. But it's hard to imagine a finer <PERSON> Sieglinde </PERSON> than <PERSON> Jessye </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>. Her pillar of seamless sound and her impeccable diction are joined by a passionate commitment that makes the final scene of Act 1 breathtaking. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lakes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s latest entry in the heldentenor sweepstakes, is a more-than-respectable partner for her as <PERSON> Siegmund </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> has the vocal weight and the beauty of tone to make a world-class Wotan. An occasional blandness mars his interpretation of this complex character, but he is still relatively new to the part. As <PERSON> Bruennhilde </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hildegard </PERSON> <PERSON> Behrens </PERSON> sounds as good as she ever has, which is splendid. The voice is thinner than ideal, but she never sounds harsh or raw here as she sometimes does in performance, and her understanding of the character is impressive. The lesser roles are cast impeccably. <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> as <PERSON> Fricke </PERSON> provides a link to the great tradition of early post-World War II operatic singing, and <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Moll </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Hunding </LOCATION>, is one of the finest German basses in recent memory. Even the chorus of <LOCATION> Valkyries </LOCATION> is unusually strong, including such major artists as <PERSON> Marita </PERSON> <PERSON> Napier </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mims </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelm </PERSON>. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> and the orchestra do themselves proud. The sound is always smooth and sonorous and the interpretation is quite moving at the climactic moments, especially <PERSON> Wotan </PERSON>'s eloquent farewell to the disgraced Bruennhilde in Act 3. The orchestra, widely regarded as one of the world's finest ensembles, had not recorded a home-grown production for 16 years, since <PERSON> Bizet </PERSON>'s `` Carmen'' with <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> conducting. This `` Walkuere'' certainly whets the appetite for the rest of the Ring recordings and, one hopes, for more Met projects to follow. _ By <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Imaginos'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Blue Oyster Cult Crash-and-burn guitars. Monster-movie lyrics. Sinister vocals. <PERSON> Durn </PERSON>, it must be the Blue Oyster Cult! Yes, all the trademarks of the Cult are evident on `` Imaginos.'' But they seem hollow and sometimes downright silly amid the dense, plodding heavy metal that characterizes most of <ORGANIZATION> BOC </ORGANIZATION>'s latest effort. This band has sounded stagnant for about a decade now, coasting on the devil-in-leather imagery that at one time produced some of the most ferocious music on the rock' n' roll landscape. Can anyone who experienced the multi-guitar rave-ups of <ORGANIZATION> BOC </ORGANIZATION>'s first five albums -LRB- or their mind-blowing live shows -RRB- fail to be disappointed with the overdone bashing about on `` Imaginos? The band has one of the genre's finest guitarists in <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> `` Buck Dharma'' <PERSON> Roeser </PERSON>, and the Blue Oyster Cult does know how to rock. But the good moments here are just that _ a good guitar lick here, an imaginative vocal turn there, buried in second-rate material. You can sit and nod when the good bits emerge, if that's your idea of a good time Giving credit where it's due, `` Del Rio's Song'' soars above the rest, distinguished by its crisp production, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>'s raw-edged vocal and a strong, tuneful melody. There's also an interesting, fancied-up remake of `` Astronomy,'' a song they first did in 1974. By most standards, this would be a decent hard rock LP. But the Blue Oyster Cult has demonstrated many times they are more than a decent hard rock band. That's what makes listening to `` Imaginos'' so infuriating. _ By <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Paint Another Picture'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Love </PERSON> <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Love </PERSON> is one of the greatest rock' n' roll singers ever to grace our planet. Her work with <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> in the 1960s _ `` He's a Rebel,'' `` <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ron </PERSON>'' _ recorded under a variety of names, stands as the definition of the <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> sound. And `` Christmas -LRB- Baby, Please Come Home -RRB-'' is simply the best rock' n' roll Christmas record ever. That's why her first solo album, even with help from <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> and master producer <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Iovine </PERSON>, is a disappointment. Love is n't the problem here. Thankfully, she's not one of those time-ravaged legends croaking their way to another payday; after more than two decades at it, she still sings stunningly well. The problem is the material, which is, simply, uninteresting. Too often, Love is forced to fight her way out of syntho-pop musical cliches, and that's a tremendous waste. Best is Petty's `` We Stand a Chance,'' which rocks a bit but is n't exactly `` He's a Rebel.'' And the inclusion of a straight cover of `` You'll Never Walk Alone'' _ yep, the same one <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> moans on Labor Day _ is simply puzzling. The record clocks in under 32 minutes, which, one assumes, is testimony enough to the problem Love had in finding worthy songs for this project. Since `` Paint Another Picture'' probably wo n't sell a zillion copies, here's hoping <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> gives her another chance. The notion of <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Love </PERSON> making rock' n' roll records again is exciting; it's too bad this record is n't _ By <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer

 They are in their late 70s, yet <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronyn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Tandy </PERSON> manage to throw off more creative energy than a crowd of <ORGANIZATION> Brat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packers </ORGANIZATION>. Some of that energy can be viewed in `` Cocoon: The Return,'' in which they reprise their roles as a married couple facing the husband's serious illness. In the first film, the rejuvenated Cronyn dived, swam and ran. This time he was scheduled to join <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ameche </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Wilford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brimley </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilford </PERSON> in a pickup basketball match with four teen-agers. `` I had never played basketball in my life; at my school it was not a big activity,'' said <PERSON> Cronyn </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrie </PERSON>, the director of ` Cocoon II,' said, ` At least you've got to learn to dribble and pass properly; I'm sending you a basketball.' `` The basketball arrived while I was teaching at the university in <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. I tried to hide myself in the hotel parking lot _ because to see an old boy of 77 bouncing a basketball all by himself hour after hour ... `` Of course when I got to the filming of it, they had doubles. I hardly did anything but pass the ball to get rid of it. I felt quite bitter about it.'' Cronyn is no stranger to movie stunts. He reminisced about the 1947 `` Brute Force,'' in which he and <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON> staged a climactic battle atop a burning prison tower. `` At the end of it, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> picked me up and hurled me off the flaming tower,'' the actor recalled. `` I dropped 20 feet onto a platform. That is a long drop. I've done some diving in my time. Get 20 feet above the water and make a mistake, you do n't forget it. If you do n't fall right onto a pile of mattresses, that's the last time you'll do anything. I would n't dare do anything like that now.'' `` Oh yes, you would,'' Miss Tandy corrected with a laugh. `` It's the challenge that attracts him And <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> keeps himself in good shape. I do n't worry about him.'' The veteran stars, who are husband and wife, require a large amount of vitality, especially when they are appearing in a two-character play such as the Pulitzer Prize-winning `` The Gin Game.'' `` It's essential if you are performing that you keep your energy,'' Miss <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> said. `` You ca n't let go. You've got to keep in good shape. `` We get old, and we ca n't do quite as much as we used to. But at least you have to do the best you can.'' The pursuit of excellence has marked both their careers. Hers began in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where she was born in 1909. At 16 she made her stage debut, at 21 she was appearing in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> theater. <PERSON> Cronyn </PERSON> was also born in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. He started acting in the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> theater and moved to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> in 1934. Both of their careers flourished after their 1942 marriage. How did they meet? Tandy: `` I was working in a play in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> was in the audience, and he came backstage to see a friend of his who was also in the play. He said, ` How do you do?' and we went out to supper with our mutual friend. Then we ...'' Cronyn: `` Quarreled.'' Tandy: `` We quarreled quite often, yes. It was not a sort of ` blinding light.''' Cronyn: `` My version was hilarious. I went back to see this actor, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>, who was appearing in the play with <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON>. I had seen her on the stage a couple of years previously in a play called ` The White Steed' and had admired her. ... We went out to supper together, and I made what I thought was an amusing and caustic remark about the nature of the English, which <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> found heavy-handed and stupid, which she let me know in no uncertain terms.'' Tandy: `` It was n't that night at all. It was another occasion entirely. -LRB- laughing -RRB- So there you are. It really does n't matter.'' During the early years of marriage, they pursued separate careers. He appeared in such films as `` Shadow of a Doubt,'' `` The Seventh Cross'' and `` Ziegfeld Follies,'' she in `` The Valley of Decision,'' `` The Green Years'' and `` Forever Amber.'' Her greatest fame came when she created the role of <PERSON> Blanche </PERSON> <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON> in `` A Streetcar Named Desire.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> chose her co-star, <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON>, for the film version but passed up Miss Tandy for a movie name, <PERSON> Vivien </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON>. In recent times the <ORGANIZATION> Cronyns </ORGANIZATION> have appeared separately, but they have earned a reputation as the latter-day <ORGANIZATION> Lunts </ORGANIZATION>, co-starring in 12 plays, including `` The Fourposter'' and `` A Delicate Balance,'' films such as `` Cocoon'' and `` batteries not included,'' and the recent television film `` Foxfire,'' which he co-wrote and for which she won an Emmy. Will they ever retire? Tandy: `` Oh yes. I hope that I shall be wise enough to stop before everyone else knows I should stop. I think that I will do less than I used to. But I do long for a challenge. I do want to do another play, even though eight shows a week is hard work. However, that's what I enjoy most.'' Cronyn: `` I think <PERSON> Jess </PERSON> is a more dedicated actress than I am an actor. It means a great deal in her life, and it means a lot in mine. But there are other things I enjoy doing: I like trying to write. `` I find it very difficult just to sit. I would love to learn how to do that with contentment. I fill my life with a lot of ` busyness' in between jobs Then I work very hard. Some of it is quite unhealthy. It's compulsive. I do n't know what to do about that. I'm a little old to change.

<HEAD>The Artists: Spun Sugar, Sculpted Chocolate And Visions of
Sugarplums</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Visions of wonderful sugarplums have danced in <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumin </PERSON>'s head, and his hands gambol through hot melted sugar to turn those visions into glorious life. His tools are sugar and water, heat, a thermometer, dyes and a marble slab on which to pour the sugar syrup, heated to 314 degrees. Most of all, though, he uses his hands, which after 53 years at his craft, are gnarled and scarred and stained. <PERSON> Kumin </PERSON> pulls sugar into ropes to weave a basket as delicate and precious as porcelain. He blows sugar, just as glass is blown, to create shimmering pieces of fruit to fill the bowl. And he molds sugar for flower petals and leaves. One of his baskets is part of an astonishing exhibit of 200 culinary fantasies called `` The Confectioner's Art,'' now at the American Craft Museum in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The show will travel to 10 cities into 1991. Pulling sugar is hard work, requiring strength and speed. At a touch he shapes the petals of a rose; a twist, and there's a leaf. And in no time he has `` pretty much a rose like <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Nature </PERSON> makes'em.'' <PERSON> Kumin </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> pastry chef who is tall and trim, apparently is able to resist the temptation of his own creations. However, no matter how lovely or ingenious, what he creates is temporary, and his basket and some of the other pieces may not even last through the tour of `` The <ORGANIZATION> Confectioners </ORGANIZATION>' Art.'' `` In our trade, you understand, if it lasts forever, we would lose our jobs. So you make another,'' said <PERSON> Kumin </PERSON>, now executive chef at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pastry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Elmsford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, during a demonstration of his work at the museum. `` The Confectioner's Art'' is one rarely recognized, but apparently popular, as people have lined up outside the museum to see such works as a sugar recreation of a Spanish cathedral door, stunning in its intricacy; what appears to be a tapestry of the Statue of Liberty, actually made from jelly beans; a gorgeous blown sugar vase, with a surprise cadre of sugar ants marching up one side; a chocolate bowl that looks like swirled pottery; or an extravagant chocolate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> skyline carved into a giant Big Apple. There are edible bracelets, a dazzling sugar <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> castle, glorious wedding cakes and a licorice mosaic. Some pieces are witty and silly; some are literally too pretty to eat. The creators are equally diverse, some without formal training, pastry chefs or artists who also work with more lasting materials, even major manufacturers who introduced some whimsy in their products. The exhibit also includes the history of sugar and chocolate; tools of the trade; holiday sweets; and packaging and presentation. <PERSON> Meryle </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a food historian and curator of the exhibit, said its popularity stems from the place sugar and chocolate hold in our hearts _ and tummies. `` Sweet foods are associated with celebration, with rites of passage, prosperity and collective joy,'' she said. `` Sweets and their creators have, over many centuries, provided a mirror of civilization, reflecting the customs and traditions of society.'' In Renaissance <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the confectioner first flourished as an artist. `` In that opulent, extravagant era, with its ferment of expression in all the arts, the confectioner joined the sculptor, wood carver and architect to produce all manner of elaborate allegorical tableaux to grace the banquet tables of popes and princes,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> wrote in the catalog to the exhibit. Today, food arts have been revived. `` Food has become a much more important part of our lives again, the whole idea of an artistic presentation,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. She also noted that many pieces mirror more traditional art, including <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>'s pink and lilac blown sugar vase, called `` Ode on a Grecian Urn.'' `` People are coming in not expecting to see art; they're surprised somehow at the results,'' said <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, who also blows glass `` But some of the pieces could be in any gallery if they were in ceramic or a conventional medium.'' But food holds special appeal. `` An artist, of course, hopes that his art can be consumed by the mind and the eye, and if it's consumed by the stomach ... it's another way to have it touch people,'' said <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, an artist from <LOCATION> Hoboken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who said his initial proposal for a sugar sculpture of a full-size barbecue grill with hotdogs and hamburgers was turned down as too lowbrow But, he said, he could n't resist the marching ants. `` The Confectioner's Art,'' sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chocolate </ORGANIZATION>, is in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> through Jan. 22, and travels to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Blooomfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said she hopes people will leave this exhibit `` with an appreciation of the art of men and women dedicated to making our lives a little pleasanter, as well as tastier. But it's all look-but-don ` `` For some reason, the mere fact that it's in a museum, seems to be a deterrent,'' she said. `` Even none of the little kids have tried'' to take a bite.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Richard Thompson Still Has a Sense of Purpose</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> has been making records for over 20 years. His music, though, draws on sources much older. `` I hope that things like age are n't that important,'' said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 39, a guitarist, singer and songwriter who helped form the seminal English folk-rock group, <LOCATION> Fairport </LOCATION> Convention, in 1967. `` When I was 20, I was listening to people who were dead. You have to listen to everything.'' <LOCATION> Fairport </LOCATION> Convention seemed to work in the opposite direction of rock music at the time. Instead of being influenced by the psychedelic sounds of the Beatles on `` Sgt. Pepper,'' <LOCATION> Fairport </LOCATION> Convention incorporated music from previous centuries. Rather than use backward tape loops and distorted guitars, <LOCATION> Fairport </LOCATION> Convention experimented with the fiddle and mandolin. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who left the group in 1971, recalled the sense of purpose the members shared. `` We were concerned about reviving a traditional music in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. I listened to a lot of Scottish music. That's a thing that's important to me. We listened to traditional music and jazz and rock' n' roll. `` There was a great spirit of camaraderie and musical exploration. I remember a feeling of kinship with the bandmates at the time.'' And hit singles were not important. `` I never even thought about it. It never crossed my mind that I was going into the music business. I just found myself being a professional musician.'' His first solo album, `` Henry the Human Fly,'' came out in 1972, and combined folk-rock music with <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s hard-edged singing. The same year, he married <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, a former backup singer, and the two went on to record seven LPs together. In 1982, they released `` Shoot Out the Lights,'' one of the most acclaimed records of the year, but were divorced soon after. The popularity of the recording duo threatened to overshadow <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s solo career as fans speculated whether his often bitter love songs were about <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>. `` Songs are really work of the imagination,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` I think it's putting too much of a limit to say this song's about this person or that person. It should be bigger than that.'' In `` I Still Dream,'' a ballad off his new album, `` Amnesia,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> sings: `` And I never was to know that I'd come to miss you so. But time winds down and I turned my back long ago.'' He stressed the song was not about his ex-wife. `` It's really a story song. It's not me. I'm telling a story about a guy whose life seems aimless. It seems dull and dead. He's compromised himself all the way. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> took six weeks to make `` Amnesia,'' and for the first time, recorded in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Yankee, Go Home,'' another song from the LP, might impress listeners as an attack against American imperialisn, but <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> does n't see it that way. `` I see it as a friendly arm around the shoulder of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Saying how we in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> used to have an empire and it got frittered away. Finally, we've learned to adjust to this ` tragic' fact. Now it's your turn. It's time for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> not to be Number 1.'' On `` <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on the Jukebox,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> deals with a subject familiar to most Americans: television evangelists. `` ` <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>' is the name of a hymn sung in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. It's a great song. I heard it played on a television show and was so alarmed that things would reach this point. `` Is -LRB- evangelist -RRB- <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggert </PERSON> the tip of the iceberg? What passes for spirituality?'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> says there is not yet an English equivalent to <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggert </PERSON>, but there is the possibility: `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is dying for someone like <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggert </PERSON>. That sort of professional sincerity. He'd be huge in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.'' Many of <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s songs have sad overtones. He sings about jealousy, lost love, death. But he noted that just because songs are about sad events, they're not necessarily sad songs. `` It's sad, but cathartic. Expressing sadness is n't such a sad business. It can make you feel quite good. I supposed I'm a really a realist.'' A realist, not a cynic. Rock was once considered a music for young people, but many of its greatest performers are now middle-aged and have struggled for a reason to continue. Not <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. `` Every once in a while, I step to one side and ask myself the reason I'm playing music. Having re-established the direction, it's easier to keep going,'' he said `` If you see music as experiment and education, there is no end to it. You're always looking for the next thing. If you're commercially successful and you see that as the end, there's going to be a real anti-climax. And <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> still believes in drawing on a wide array of music, regardless of how many records he sells. `` Rock' n' roll is now so multi-generational. You can fit almost every musical style in existence into rock music these days. I'm on the edge of it rather than the middle of it.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferlinghetti </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> file once described him as `` a Beatnik Rabble Rouser,'' looked like an elder statesman with his trim white beard, navy jacket and patterned tie as he promoted his first novel in 28 years, `` Love in the Days of Rage.'' But the man whose City Lights press published and sustained a generation of Beat poets is not another yippie gone yuppie. Look closer and you see he's wearing an onyx stud in his right ear. <PERSON> Ferlinghetti </PERSON> is chiefly known as a lyrical poet whose 1958 work, `` A <LOCATION> Coney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> of the Mind,'' is one of the best-selling books of poetry in the past three decades, and as a political anarchist whose publication of <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON>'s `` Howl'' led to his arrest on obscenity charges. Although he has published some two dozen collections of poetry, as well as essays and a handful of plays in his more than three decades of writing, <PERSON> Ferlinghetti </PERSON> has written only one other novel. `` Her,'' published in 1960, is a surreal account of a young man's search for his identity `` Love in the Days of Rage'' -LRB- <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON>, $ 15.95 -RRB- is set in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1968, during the student-led spring riots that shut down the universities and paralyzed the city. The historical events serve as the background for a love story between <PERSON> Annie </PERSON>, a painter who teaches at the Beaux Arts, and <PERSON> Julian </PERSON>, a wealthy financier who calls himself an anarchist banker. `` This new novel is much more accessible to the public; it's written in a much more conventional style,'' said <PERSON> Ferlinghetti </PERSON>, 69, sipping a beer in the lobby of the Algonquin hotel As if to bear out the <PERSON> Algonquin </PERSON>'s reputation as a literary haunt, well-wishers twice interrupted the interview to greet the poet. `` I really want to revivify the ` spirt of'68,' as it was called by the French. ... Especially today when we need it,'' said <PERSON> Ferlinghetti </PERSON>, who finds this decade's emphasis on wealth and success disheartening. `` In retrospect it was this ` youthquake' against the dehumanization of man, the new technocratic age.'' <PERSON> Ferlinghetti </PERSON> said many of the anarchist arguments espoused by his character <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> were lifted from <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Pessoa </PERSON>, a French-Portuguese poet who wrote a novella early in the century called `` The Anarchist Banker.'' He was asked if <PERSON> Pessoa </PERSON>'s philosophy of anarchism is his as well. `` Anarchism is n't really a philosphy and it is n't really an ideal. It's an idea. The press has given anarchism a bad name. They've equated it with terrorism. I'm talking about anarchism in the traditional sense,'' he said. `` It's mostly civil libertarianism and anti-fascism, really. ... The individual's freedom today is more and more limited, not just by our government but the whole industrial way of life. ... The point of view of the philosophical anarchist is to stand up for the free individual.'' He called <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> the archtypal anarchist, the little man with the hat and cane fighting the big cruel world. The comparison is not a flip one _ <PERSON> Ferlinghetti </PERSON> named his City Lights bookstore, co-founded with friend <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, after the classic <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> film about the tramp who falls in love with a blind woman. When the funky little shop opened in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in 1953 it was the first all-paperback bookstore in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and an instant hit. It is still open until midnight seven days a week. A few years after the bookstore, <PERSON> Ferlinghetti </PERSON> launched <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lights </ORGANIZATION> press, which published <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burroughs </PERSON> and others who would come to typify the Beat Generation. The press publishes about 12 to 15 titles a year, and <PERSON> Ferlinghetti </PERSON> and co-editor <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> aim for a mix of poetry, foreign authors _ `` what used to be called belles lettres'' _ and books on such topics as AIDS or environmental causes. The bookstore and press support one another. Some years the store makes money while the press operates at a loss, and vice versa. The goal is always to break even. To make a profit means paying taxes, says <PERSON> Ferlinghetti </PERSON> the anarchist. He challenged an interviewer's assertion that most of his writing is overtly political. He said only `` about half'' was. Inside him is a `` lyrical individual, this eros, this pleasure-seeking, love-seeking being intent on his own pursuits,'' he said. `` And every once in a while he turns aside from these pursuits to give this political lout that's loping alongside a few clouts. If you ignore him -LRB- the lout -RRB- he wo n't go away, he just grows bigger and bigger. `` It'd be nice to just be writing love poems and be listening to concertos all the time, but you have to fight the monster once in awhile,'' said <PERSON> Ferlinghetti </PERSON>, blue eyes twinkling. `` I do n't do it anymore than I have to.''

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's a tiny nightclub sandwiched between an office and recording studio, and a children's clothing store in the chic <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> section of the country music capital. The Bluebird Cafe may be a few miles from the well-worn paths tread by tourists, but it's a gathering place for recording industry executives and those trying to get their attention. It's the place where country music stars of tomorrow yearn to perform, waiting up to four months for a precious spot on the tiny stage. It's country music's answer to The Comedy Store, the Improv and Catch a Rising Star. It's country music's proving ground. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattea </PERSON> got her break there. So did the Sweethearts of the Rodeo, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Earle </PERSON>, <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>. `` I started playing there about every three or four weeks, and within three months of starting there I got a record deal,'' said <PERSON> Mattea </PERSON>, whose `` 18 Wheels and a Dozen Roses'' was voted single of the year by the <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. When featured performers are presented Friday and Saturday nights, it's standing room for those without reservations and a tight fit for those who do have them. The intimate atmosphere is integral to the music. Owner <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurland </PERSON> said she has no plans to move although the 6-year-old club seats only 130 or 150 sardine-style. `` It feels like a living room. Sometimes it's more intimidating because you can see every face in the room,'' <PERSON> Mattea </PERSON> said. Songwriter <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Knobloch </PERSON> agrees, but adds the closeness of the audience is a barometer of how new songs and songwriters are being received. `` The audiences are so close that they feel real involved in what you're doing. If you're good, they love you; if you're bad, they are polite and get up and leave,'' he said. About 90 percent of the crowd is involved in the music business and the remainder are tourists and locals, or `` real people'' as <PERSON> Kurland </PERSON> calls them. `` I desire that people be specifically interested in the music, that listening to live music is enough and maybe having a glass of wine _ not picking somebody up,'' <PERSON> Kurland </PERSON> said. `` The quality -LRB- of the performers -RRB- is always excellent. I maybe book one or two people I'm disappointed with in a year.'' <PERSON> Knobloch </PERSON> is often joined by fellow country-acoustic songwriters <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuyler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickhardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlitz </PERSON> to become SKBS, one of the club's top draws. <PERSON> Schlitz </PERSON> wrote `` The Gambler'' for <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Knobloch </PERSON> created `` Used to Be Blue'' for <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bickhardt </PERSON> wrote the <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wariner-Nicolette </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> duet `` That's How You Know When Love's Right. <PERSON> Knobloch </PERSON> got his start at the Bluebird at a Sunday writer's night _ a night set aside for songwriters to perform their new compositions. <PERSON> Kurland </PERSON> is deluged with tapes from those who know that playing a writer's night could mean a break. `` We make the music business accessible to the new guy,'' <PERSON> Kurland </PERSON> said. `` But if it was n't for the Bluebird and some other places to play, you could never really function as a songwriter -LRB- in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> -RRB-. Appearing here is a crucial part of the process.'' Budding songwriters know this and the walls of <PERSON> Kurland </PERSON>'s claustrophobic office prove it Demonstration tapes fill racks on an entire wall and others are scattered on her desk where a phone rings repeatedly and a mammoth stuffed carnival prize snake curls watching overhead. If the music satisfies <PERSON> Kurland </PERSON>'s discriminating ear, there is a four-month wait between an audition at the Bluebird until a writer can perform on a Sunday night show. `` From the time they get here to the time I would sign them as an act on a feature show, it will be nine months to one year,'' she said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, a promising acoustic-folk artist, did his time on the Bluebird circuit and <PERSON> Kurland </PERSON> has, for the first time, decided to promote the undiscovered <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor-styled </PERSON> artist among her contacts in the record world. Despite the time it takes to get on stage, many songwriters hunger after a spot on the club's calendar. `` It is a songwriter's paradise,'' said <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavender </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Songwriters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Bluebird plays a magnificent role -LRB- in the industry -RRB-. ... It is one of the greatest clubs in town. In my estimation, I think the Bluebird is the ultimate in that sort of thing -LRB- displaying songwriter's abilities -RRB-.''

<HEAD>Horticultural Whodunnit: Who killed Wurzell's Wormwood?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE KATZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Wurzell </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Wormwood </PERSON> did n't count for much when it was alive in the wild, but it's at the center of a controversy now that it's gone. `` Something that's completely new to the world, in its only locality, just was n't looked after,'' lamented <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wurzell </PERSON>, the plant's discoverer. <PERSON> Wurzell </PERSON>'s Wormwood, Artemesia wurzellii, was the pride and joy of the ecological consultant and botanist who in August 1987 discovered it growing on a 2-square-yard plot in a park in north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. His instincts told him it was something new, and tests at <ORGANIZATION> Leicester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> proved him right. He reported his discovery to the authority that runs the park, `` and I assumed from then on that the plant would be safeguarded,'' <PERSON> Wurzell </PERSON> said. On a recent visit to the site, `` I found to my horror it had been dumped on. It was no longer there.'' The loss is also mourned by <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Stace </PERSON>, a botany professor at <ORGANIZATION> Leicester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Botanical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isles </LOCATION>. `` This was notified to the people in charge of this site,'' said <PERSON> Stace </PERSON>. `` They agreed that it was interesting and they agreed to look after it and not harm it, and then some twit dumped something on it.'' Artemisia wurzellii was a hybrid of two common species, one native to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the other Chinese. Such hybrids are n't rare; the 2,500 flowering plant species found in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isles </LOCATION> have spawned some 700 hybrid, he said. But <PERSON> Wurzell </PERSON>'s discovery piqued botanists' interest because of its unusual genesis _ its parents normally flower at different times of the year. `` These two things must have flowered exceptionally, either the one early or the other late, and overlapped so that one could pollinate the other,'' <PERSON> Stace </PERSON> said. The result was n't much to look at. `` It's a rather ugly, scruffy-looking green plant'' with small brownish-greenish flowers, <PERSON> Stace </PERSON> said. `` It is not at all attractive. Its interest is totally scientific as opposed to aesthetic.'' But <PERSON> Wurzell </PERSON>, like a proud parent, saw some beauty in the botanical mongrel: `` It's not something you would grow in your garden to look pretty. But it had a dignity of its own.'' <ORGANIZATION> Leicester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> botanists managed to cultivate a cutting from a small piece of root Wurzell sent them shortly after discovering the plant. But other than that, Artemisia wurzellii is just a memory. `` It is extinct in the wild,'' <PERSON> Wurzell </PERSON> said. He wants to know who to blame. `` I ca n't point an accusing finger,'' he said, `` but it looks as though the contractors of a nearby road simply spread lots of soil ... having no idea that there was anything there that should n't have been dumped on.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Lea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> promises to get to the root of things. But an official, who insisted on anonymity, cautioned, `` It might be nothing to do with road construction at all. Meanwhile, botanists can only wonder what might have been. `` If you destroy something, you do n't know what you've lost,'' <PERSON> Stace </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wurzell </PERSON>'s wormwood might even have had commercial potential, he said, noting that it comes from the strongly scented Artemisia genus. But even if it was ugly and useless, it'll be missed. `` It's like a big jigsaw,'' <PERSON> Stace </PERSON> said. `` You might say you've got a jigsaw of a thousand pieces, so it does n't really matter if you lose one, you've only lost one in a thousand But it does spoil the jigsaw, does n't it?''

<HEAD>Uranium Atom Split 50 Years Ago This Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 Fifty years ago this month, two German scientists working with relatively simple equipment on unfinished pine tables split the uranium atom, rocking the physics world and ushering in the nuclear age. An unthinkable idea at the time, atom-splitting was later called nuclear fission and used to produce nuclear power and the atomic bomb. It brought <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> a 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry. A year later, the bombing of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> turned his triumph to shock and self-blame. `` I was shocked and depressed beyond measure,'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> wrote in his autobiography. `` The thought of the unspeakable misery of countless innocent women and children was something that I could scarcely bear.'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, Austrian physicist <PERSON> Lise </PERSON> <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON> and chemist <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Strassmann </PERSON> began their work after experiments by others who bombarded uranium with neutrons. Neutrons, along with protons and electrons, are building blocks of atoms. Starting in 1934 with research by physicist <PERSON> Enrico </PERSON> <PERSON> Fermi </PERSON>, scientists were reporting varying answers about what elements were produced as a result of that bombardment. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and colleagues decided to get to the bottom of that question. The historic experiment began the evening of Dec. 16, 1938, with another bombardment of uranium. As <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Strassmann </PERSON> worked to identify the new atoms that resulted, `` we were faced by something distinctly odd,'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. To help in identifying the minute quantities of new atoms, the scientists had been mixing in the element barium, which would grab onto similar atoms. The barium latched onto some newly created atoms, meaning they were either radium or barium. Barium was out of the question, according to theory at the time. To produce barium, the bombardment would have had to split the atoms. But further experiments left no doubt. On Dec. 21, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Strassmann </PERSON> finished a hastily written manuscript that announced their results, but cautiously. `` As chemists,'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said, `` we hesitated to announce a revolutionary discovery in physics.'' The theoretical explanation came from <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON> and her nephew, physicist <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON>, who realized the uranium atom had split like a wobbling raindrop that finally breaks into two. They also realized that the splitting released an enormous amount of energy. The energy from just one ounce of uranium could supply the average American household with electricity for 70 years. The news spread quickly. <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON> had barely begun telling Danish physicist <PERSON> Niels </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohr </PERSON> on Jan. 3, 1939, when <PERSON> Bohr </PERSON> struck his forehead and exclaimed, `` Oh, what fools we have been! We ought to have seen that before!''

<HEAD>Teddy Bear Helps Regulate Premature Infants' Breathing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STORRS, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When month-old <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Colucci </PERSON> snuggles up to the baby-blue teddy bear in his incubator, he's getting more than creature comfort. <PERSON> Vito </PERSON>, born 13 weeks premature, also is learning how to breathe. The hand-sewn, sheepskin bear in the isolette at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION> has a balloon in its abdomen connected to a mechanical air pump so the bear mimics the deep, gentle inhaling and exhaling of a healthy, sleeping person. A research project under way at the university and <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> has shown that the bears can help regulate breathing by inducing deep, quiet sleep in preemies, who frequently suffer respiratory disorders, said <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoman </PERSON>, the behaviorist who designed the project. `` This is a stimulation that I call biologically relevant,'' <PERSON> Thoman </PERSON> said. She came up with the idea about 15 years ago and experimented on rat pups deprived of their mothers. Those given a surrogate mother _ a warm, moist, pulsating tube _ survived. Those without a surrogate died. Premature infants were a natural subject for the study, since they too are separated from their mothers when they are isolated in an incubator. Her experiment is based partly on the physics principle of entrainment, which holds that all pulsating or beating objects, animate and inanimate, tend to match the rhythms of nearby objects. The phenomenon explains why a half-dozen grandfather clocks on the same wall eventually will synchronize. <PERSON> Thoman </PERSON> theorizes that the bears may calm colicky babies, and that aside from helping infants learn to breathe the bears stimulate brain development by letting the babies choose when to snuggle up to the toys.

<HEAD>Horticultural Whodunnit: Who killed Wurzell's Wormwood?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Wurzell </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Wormwood </PERSON> did n't count for much when it was alive in the wild, but it's at the center of a controversy now that it's gone. `` Something that's completely new to the world, in its only locality, just was n't looked after,'' lamented <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wurzell </PERSON>, the plant's discoverer. <PERSON> Wurzell </PERSON>'s Wormwood, Artemesia wurzellii, was the pride and joy of the ecological consultant and botanist who in August 1987 discovered it growing on a 2-square-yard plot in a park in north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. His instincts told him it was something new, and tests at <ORGANIZATION> Leicester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> proved him right. He reported his discovery to the park authority, `` and I assumed from then on that the plant would be safeguarded,'' <PERSON> Wurzell </PERSON> said. On a recent visit, `` I found to my horror it had been dumped on. It was no longer there.'' The loss is also mourned by <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Stace </PERSON>, a botany professor at <ORGANIZATION> Leicester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Botanical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isles </LOCATION>. `` This was notified to the people in charge of this site,'' said <PERSON> Stace </PERSON>. `` They agreed that it was interesting and they agreed to look after it and not harm it, and then some twit dumped something on it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Lea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> says it will get to the root of things. Artemisia wurzellii was a hybrid of two common species, one native to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the other Chinese. Such hybrids are n't rare; the 2,500 flowering plant species found in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isles </LOCATION> have spawned some 700 hybrid, he said. But <PERSON> Wurzell </PERSON>'s discovery piqued botanists' interest because of its unusual genesis _ its parents normally flower at different times of the year. `` It's a rather ugly, scruffy-looking green plant'' with small brownish-greenish flowers, <PERSON> Stace </PERSON> said. `` It is not at all attractive. Its interest is totally scientific as opposed to aesthetic.''

 It was the year they held a presidential election and half the nation's voters decided to stay home. It was the year rescuers decided to free a trio of battered, barnacle-encrusted gray whales trapped in the ice at the top of the world. It was the year an early decision to let <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> burn altered the face of the showcase national park for a century to come. It was the year <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> decided to diet, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> decided he wanted to be president, Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> decided to resign, evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> decided to confess his sins and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinks </PERSON> decided to challenge world heavyweight champion <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>. Some decisions worked; others did n't. Soviets and Americans pulled together to free two surviving whales, last seen cruising toward warmer waters. Soviet President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> bowed out, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took over. <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>, the TV host, lost 67 pounds. In <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, however, officials realized too late they might have made the wrong decision. By the time firefighters arrived, unusually dry weather and high winds had fires ripping out of control, forcing evacuation of towns and causing an uproar among area residents. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> preached on but lost much of his audience after the Assemblies of God decided to defrock him. <PERSON> Spinks </PERSON> lasted for just 91 seconds and eight decisive blows. The wisdom of other decisions remained to be seen. Faced with the choice between Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and frustrated by one of the most low-down, dirty presidential campaigns ever, an ambivalent electorate waffled and fidgeted and finally succumbed to overwhelming inertia. `` I've always loved election years,'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, but it seemed hardly anyone else did. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 54-46 percent victory over his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> opponent was based on a 50 percent voter turnout, the lowest in 64 years. Political analysts looked at exit polls and determined that many voters were n't voting for anyone so much as they were voting against the other guy. They also determined that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lost 2 percent of his supporters because they were turned off by his first major decision _ to tap as his running mate <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the first `` baby boomer'' on a national ticket and a choice that surprised even <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advisers. It was Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the silver-haired, smooth-talking senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who provided the only memorable line from the three nationally televised debates. `` Senator, you are no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a flustered <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, after the 41-year-old senator had compared himself with the late Democratic president. The Kennedy image haunted the campaign and the nation. The 25th anniversary of his assassination became a time to reflect on idealism lost and a world changed. Nowhere was that change more apparent than in U.S.-Soviet relations. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, on the campaign trail himself 28 years ago, shunned <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> when he visited <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the first Soviet leader since <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> to taste the Big Apple, had a super-power lunch with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Dec. 7 and addressed the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, with no Khrushchev-style shoe-thumping. Instead, he promised to trim 500,000 men and 10,000 tanks from the Soviet armed forces. The visit ended abruptly when a devastating earthquake hit Soviet <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The Soviet leader rushed home to learn that an estimated 60,000 had died and 500,000 were left homeless as whole cities crumbled under the quake's force. Rescue teams, doctors and planes loaded with supplies poured in from around the world. It was the first time since World War II that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had accepted disaster relief from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> paid his first visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in June for a summit that failed to break new ground in arms control. The president hammered away on human rights issues, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> later sent <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> living proof of his commitment to change. Nobel laureate <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, father of the Soviet dissident movement, was allowed his first trip outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after years of agitation over Soviet human rights policies. Americans vigorously agitated for their own causes. More than 5,000 people were arrested in anti-abortion protests that began in July in 32 cities and continued through the year. <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortion, turned 15 years old, intact. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, confirmed as a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice by a unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, inherited a pivotal vote on the abortion issue but gave no hint of his views. Court dockets bulged with the celebrated cases of the once-powerful. Former Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, were indicted on racketeering charges alleging they plundered their homeland of millions and defrauded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, the king and queen of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate, pleaded innocent to dozens of tax evasion charges. Republican <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> became the first governor in a half-century to be impeached and removed from office, although he was acquitted on criminal charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> pleaded innocent to charges of defrauding the government by selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and giving the proceeds to the Contras at a time when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Nicaraguan rebels was banned. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> refused to restore military aid to the Contras but decided to approve humanitarian aid after the Nicaraguan rebels and the Sandinista government reached a temporary truce. Uneasy peace prevailed in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq War after a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nations-sponsored </LOCATION> cease-fire began Aug. 20. Peace talks opened five days later; they were deadlocked within 24 hours. In <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, Soviet troops began a withdrawal in 1988, but the guerrilla war raged on.

 For one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval captain, the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> became the site July 3 of a split-second decision with tragic consequences. As Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' guided-missile cruiser, the USS Vincennes, exchanged fire with Iranian speedboats, <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Flight 655 appeared on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship's high-tech radar. Mistaken reports said the aircraft appeared to be descending and accelerating, as if attacking; it failed to respond to warnings on civilian and military channels. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> gave the order to fire. The decision, he later said, was in defense of his ship and crew. But what <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> feared was an Iranian F-14 fighter actually was an Airbus A300 with 290 people aboard, all of whom died. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration defended the decision but also decided to compensate the victims' families. Among the dead: a woman flying with her eight children to meet her husband; an Iranian couple flying to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> to shop for a daughter's wedding. Three days later, a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil and gas platform exploded, killing 167 men in the world's worst-ever oilfield disaster and creating another list of private tragedies. A bride of a few weeks became a widow; a teen-ager who had worked offshore only a few days died, as did a man who had volunteered to return to work a week early. AIDS killed its 45,000 th American victim More than 7,000 researchers from 140 countries gathered in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, where they examined 3,200 reports on the fatal disease and agreed they had made little progress toward treatment or cure. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a new AIDS case was being reported every 14 minutes, for a total of more than 30,000 in 1988. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> began a needle exchange program to try to curb the disease's spread among needle-sharing drug addicts. Drug use overshadowed the Summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, where Canadian sprinter <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> lost his gold medal, his 9.79 world record in the 100-yard dash and millions in endorsements when tests showed he had used muscle-building anabolic steroids. The Winter Olympics in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, produced heroes who won no medals. Speed skater <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> became the world's Heartbreak Kid with his decision to compete _ and his subsequent fall _ hours after his sister's death. As winter turned to spring, the fickle weather that had delayed ski and sled events in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION> became devastating drought across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, baking the nation's farmland and turning the mighty <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> into a muddy mess impassable for weeks. Crops and profits shriveled in the fields as grain production dropped by one-third, but the farmer got some help from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ $ 3.9 billion in drought relief. There was little relief on the other side of the world as floods submerged three-fourths of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, stranding at least 20 million people who were forced to eat raw food and drink contaminated water. As if the tiny country had not suffered enough, cyclones later killed thousands. Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> blasted across <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, bounced off the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and careened toward <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coast was spared in the end. All told, the storm caused billions of dollars in damage, mostly to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where more than 200 people died. In the skies, there were tragedies, triumphs and a couple of miracles. A collision by three jets trying to create an aerial valentine at an airshow in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> killed 70 people. An explosion of a military plane killed Pakistani President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> and 28 others, changing that country's destiny. <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> became prime minister, the office once held by her father, deposed and hanged by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> 11 years ago. The roof of a Hawaiian island-hopping <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 ripped away like a can under an opener, but the plane landed safely, with only one death. In a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> crash at <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, 13 people died, but 95 survived what early reports called a `` non-survivable'' accident. And millions held their breath as the space shuttle Discovery readied for launch, the first since the Challenger disaster 32 months earlier. On the ground at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, space veteran <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> made the final decision to `` go.'' A relieved nation cheered as the shuttle safely passed the point where the Challenger had exploded. `` Each one of us knows where our place in the future is, where Americans should be _ it's in space,'' Discovery astronaut <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON> said. `` So let's ... make this adventure happen again and again and again.''

 As the 1988 political year began, the conventional wisdom was that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s retirement would mean a close race for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his loyal-to-a-fault vice president, had little chance to succeed him. Now, at the end of a long campaign road strewn with the wreckage of such assumptions, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is forming his administration and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is back at his old stand as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Democrats are taking comfort in their gains in other races. Despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 40-state victory Nov. 8, the Democrats added to their congressional majorities, picking up one <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat and three in the House. With one more Democratic governor, the party now has 28, to 22 for the Republicans. But after losing their fifth presidential election out of the last six, the Democrats were wondering when they would ever regain control of the White House. For the voters, Election Day brought a welcome end to a campaign that often was more slime than substance. Convicted rapist <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> gained celebrity status and a dead fish floating among the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> debris became a familiar television image. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was another `` liberal governor coming out of nowhere'' who had vetoed legislation to require the Pledge of Allegiance in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> schools and who was a `` card-carrying member of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>.'' Republicans were portrayed as `` popping champagne corks in their penthouses.'' And their nominee? `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a man who was born on third base and thinks that he's hit a triple,'' was one of the biggest applause lines at the Democratic National Convention. Was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a wimp? Was <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> too cold? Such matters overshadowed concerns about the budget and trade deficits, education, drugs, and defense and foreign policy. The election year opened with high hopes for the Democrats. The popular <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, after all, would not be on the ballot. The Democrats had regained control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, many polls reported Americans wanted a change in political leadership after seven years of a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and everywhere <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went he was dogged by questions about his role in the Iran-Contra affair. What did the vice president know and what advice had he given the president? `` I've answered the questions and I've cooperated fully with any investigations, none of which, by the way, were aimed at me,'' he responded, refusing to discuss what he had told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Large fields were running hard in both parties at the start of the election year _ eight Democrats and six Republicans. The Democratic contenders, along with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, were Sens. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>; Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>; former Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and former Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. On the Republican side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was regarded as a shaky front-runner with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> GOP leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> given strong chances of brushing the vice president out of the race. The other contenders were former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, former Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was written off after finishing third to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` The hemorrhaging of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has begun,'' said <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>. But <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> stopped that hemorrhaging and put <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> back on track to the nomination. Displaying an uncanny consistency, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> voters also gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a third-place finish and he, too, won in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. The two big winners in Super Tuesday's combination of primaries were liberals <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> did well in the Southern primaries, but he had to split votes there with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and had little support north of the Mason-Dixon Line. On the Republican side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> swept all 16 primaries on the big day. That effectively locked up the nomination for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> still had a tough road ahead. He finished third in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> behind favorite sons <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and then was upset by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. But when the race came down to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> against <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor ran off a string of victories that clinched the nomination. The Democrats roasted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at their convention, put on a closing-night unity show and saw their nominee jump to double-digit leads in the national polls. Enter <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>. In television commercials and countless speeches, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign raised the case of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> convict who, while free on a furlough from prison, raped a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman. The Republicans also attacked the Democratic nominee for vetoing the Pledge of Allegiance bill and for <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>'s pollution. For weeks, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ignored the attacks. But his big lead in the polls was dwindling and by Labor Day it was gone. By the time he responded, it was too late. The big lead had swung to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> built his lead despite what was widely regarded as a major political mistake _ his selection of Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> as his running mate. National polls consistently reported voters, by a wide margin, preferred <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> over <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. But on Nov. 8 voters focused on the presidential nominees. Despite <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s presence on the ticket, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> carried <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` I think one of the lessons of the campaign is that you have to respond and you have to respond quickly,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at a post-election news conference. It was one of the kinder assessments of his effort, which many other Democrats called `` the worst campaign of this century.'' But the 1988 votes were no sooner counted than Democrats began looking to 1992, when some old names _ <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> _ may contend with some new _ Sens. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and the newly elected <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> _ for the Democratic nomination.

<TEXT>
 Guns fell silent on several battlefronts in 1988, and hope emerged that mankind stood at the dawn of a more peaceful age. It seemed as though the world had decided it had enough of war. Blood was still being shed in some parts of the globe. But <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> opted for a cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the Soviets began to withdraw troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> chose to work towards peace in southwestern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The year began with the ink barely dry on the first superpower treaty to eliminate a class of nuclear weapons. Before the year was out, many missiles were destroyed. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> truce troops won the Nobel Peace Prize. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met not once, but twice, with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who announced unilateral reductions in military strength. `` Forces have already emerged in the world that in one way or another stimulate the arrival of a period of peace,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Among other developments, Olympic athletes from both East and West met in the Summer Games for the first time in 12 years in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Fears of North Korean sabotage of the Games proved unfounded, and the two Koreas took steps toward reconciliation. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> also mediated peace talks on the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, which occupies most of the northwest African territory, and the Polisario independence movement. <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s non-communist nations, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and the U.N.-recognized Cambodian government-in-exile worked toward getting Vietnamese occupying forces to withdraw from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders met to discuss the possibility of reuniting the divided <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> said it recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements still did not go far enough. Meanwhile, Palestinians died at the rate of almost one a day in their anti-Israeli uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. And conflicts raged on in many other parts of the globe: _ <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> struggled through political turmoil _ <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> simmered with continued fighting in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and an uneasy truce in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> _ Moslem guerrillas continued their fight in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> against the Soviet-allied government _ The Sikhs still struggled for an independent homeland in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, as did the Tamils in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, and other rebel groups in the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> _ Five thousand died in ethnic violence in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> _ Dozens died and thousands were forced to leave their homes because of domestic unrest in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ And in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the streets of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> remained a battleground The nation came closer than ever to formal partitioning into Christian and Moslem sectors, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> raiders struck repeatedly against the south in retaliation for anti-Israel guerrilla activity. Still, the year wound to a close with a sense of hope. `` There is a new mood of understanding and common sense,'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said in accepting the peace prize Dec. 10. `` We can, and must, achieve what we have dreamed of for so long, that is to make the rule of law the standard rather than the exception in world affairs.''

<HEAD>Crippen's `Go' Puts Americans Back in Space</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With tension high, the countdown clock for the launch of space shuttle Discovery ticked down to nine minutes, and then was stopped, deliberately, to be held there for 10 minutes while one man made the critical decision on whether to proceed toward liftoff. This was no ordinary countdown. It was to be <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first shuttle flight since the Challenger explosion killed seven crew members 32 monthsture of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space program was at stake. Memories of that tragedy were earlier. The fu on everyone's mind as five astronauts boarded Discovery on the morning of Sept. 29. One of the astronauts' own, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, a veteran of four shuttle missions, had the awesome responsibility to make the decision that would send them on their way, or keep them on the ground for another day. <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>'s assignment was a product of Challenger. No one man held sole authority to say `` go'' or `` no-go'' on any of the previous 26 shuttle launches. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> decided it needed such a launch czar to avoid the communications failures that prevented the concerns of lower-level engineers about cold weather from reaching those making the decision to launch Challenger. The frigid temperature was cited by inve. Two months later, the count reached nine minutes on the second post-Challenger mission. Again, high altitude winds were a problem. This time they were too strong, but they moderated gradually throughout the morning. <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> looked at the latest data and made his decision, dispatching <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> and five astronauts on a secret <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> mission during which they reportedly released a sophisticated reconnaissance satellite. It was another successful flight on <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s comeback trail. The successes set the stage for a stepped-up shuttle launch schedule in 1989. Seven flights are planned, including three scientifically prized missions that will deploy the <ORGANIZATION> Hubble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telescope </ORGANIZATION> and dispatch payloads to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and Jupiter.

<HEAD>Indecision Leaves Billion-Dollar Headache for Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT McCARTNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For sale: Dozens and dozens of insolvent savings and loan institutions bleeding red ink to the tune of millions of dollars. Ultimate cost to clean up the industry: between $ 50 billion and $ 100 billion. Contact the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, the new landlords. If 1988 was a year of decision for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> electorate, for a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, for millions of amnesty-seeking aliens and for countless others, then it was also a year of indecision for those charged with resolving the multibillion-dollar savings and loan crisis. A result of economic recession here in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, high-flying antics of speculators and developers, and widespread fraud in the early 1980s, the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L problem has grown over the past few years from a million-dollar headache to a billion-dollar migraine that may hinder budget and no-new-taxes planning by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` The thrift industry's problems alone now demand funding on a massive scale,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and one of the nation's top banking regulators. `` That funding requirement appears to exceed the combined resources devoted to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> under the Marshall Plan, and the bailouts of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, launched a much-heralded `` Southwest Plan'' in 1988 to begin folding the losers into money-making thrifts. But analysts have criticized the slow pace of the plan, and the cost. Fifty-four grossly insolvent S & amp; Ls were sold, but at least 164 remained unresolved. `` It's full-steam ahead, and we're going as fast as we can get the cases done,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FHLBB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Federal prosecutors launched one of the biggest white-collar-crime task forces in history, taking over almost an entire floor of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. But the pace of major indictments has been slow, and the statute of limitations on bank fraud -LRB- five years -RRB- was hanging over the effort. And despite the dire economic predictions and an `` indecision meter'' adding $ 1 billion a month to the cost of resolving the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L problem, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> opted to continue to study the problem, rather than raise taxes to close out the cases. `` We were calculating the cost of closure at $ 20 billion three years ago,'' said industry analyst <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Veribanc </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They did n't have the $ 20 billion back then either.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, historically a nation of youthful orientation, is now thirty-something and heading upward, reports the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. If present trends continue, census officials expect that half of all Americans will be over the age of 39 by the year 2010, and half younger. The agency's most recent estimate of median age was 32.1, as of last July 1, the highest ever. The 35-44 age group is the fastest-growing segment of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population, and the population segments aged 85 and over and 75-84 rank second and third in growth since 1980, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said. Combining to increase the median age of the population are the maturing of the massive post World War II Baby Boom and that generation's relatively low birth rates, which reduce the number of babies to pull down the numbers. The median age of the country touched 30 for the first time in 1950, then slipped back as the Baby Boom produced a bouncing crop of youngsters to lower the numbers. It took until the 1980 census to hit 30 again, edged up to 31.7 as of 1986 and is expected to climb to 33 by 1990, 36.5 by 2000 and 39 by the year 2010, according to the new projections from the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the aging of the population, however, the report anticipates that the so-called dependency ratio will decline. That ratio is the number of people under 18 and over 65 compared to the number of people of working age in between. The younger and older groups are most likely to `` depend'' on those working. The 1986 ratio of 62.2 dependents per 100 workers is expected to slip to 56.7 by the year 2010, with the low birth rate reducing the number of young dependents to a greater extent than aging adds to the older group. While there have been reports of increases in the total number of births in the last few years, that is because the giant Baby Boom generation is largely in its prime child-bearing years. The rate of births per 1,000 remains well below that of the post-World War II period. `` The repercussions of the Baby Boom are many and varied,'' <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> statistician <PERSON> Louisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` They will continue to affect the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for many years to come.'' They are now at the age where they have more discretionary income and the effect can be seen in the nation's culture and marketing, she said. The generation's arrival spurred a boom in sales of baby products. It then proceeded to overwhelm the school system, following up with creation of a national orientation toward teen-age music and styles. Now, as the Baby Boomers set up more and smaller households, they are prompting a boom in housing sales and household goods, marketing experts say. `` Further down the road, once they begin to reach retirement age, they will obviously have a great effect on the direction the country takes,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> added. The census projections show the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> remaining the oldest section of the country, with the median age for that region increasing from 33.6 in 1986 to 40.3 in 2010. The South will be second in 2010 at a median age of 38.4, up from 31.4 in 1986. The Midwest will mature from 31.6 to 38.8 and the West will go from 31.0 to 37.4. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will remain the state with the highest median age and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> will still be the youngest state, according to the projections. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, with a median age of 36.0 in 1986, will age to 45.3. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s median will rise from 25.5 to 27.6, leaving it the only state with a median age below 30 years, thanks largely to a continuing high birth rate. In the 1986 estimates no state had a median over 40 but several were under 30, including _ besides <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. In 2010 not only <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will have topped 40. Other states with median ages above that milestone will include <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.

 Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> says old people do n't have to suffer poor health just because they're old. `` The whole theme of this meeting is it's never too late to start prevention,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said at a workshop on health promotion and aging. `` Old age is not a disease and there are many oldsters who are disease free,'' said the 71-year-old <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>. `` You do n't necessarily have to have your kidneys fail, you do n't necessarily have to have dementia. ... My plea would be to separate old age and disease. They do n't necessarily go together.'' Even though the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population is aging, he said, it is not becoming less healthy. `` As we see people who are now in middle-age come along into the graying years they are going to be far healthier than this generation was when it entered the 65-and-older group,'' he said. `` These are the people who are jogging and swimming and hiking. These are the people who are snacking on salad and yogurt. These are the people who are wearing sensible shoes. They have stopped smoking. They have given up hard liquor. They wear seat belts. They understand the things they can do to preserve the quality of life and the function they already have.''

 The returns are spectacular for <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> members, average age 82, who give their time to collect old newspapers for recycling in this retirement community. Their efforts allow local charities to save an estimated $ 80,000 each year in rent, send dozens of handicapped kids to a special camp at no cost to their families, and provide drug education in nearby elementary schools. The <ORGANIZATION> Host </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION>, and nine other <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clubs </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area, earn about $ 200,000 annually by collecting, bundling, transporting and selling the old newspapers that residents would otherwise throw in the trash. The newspapers pile up at the rate of 35 tons a day in the winter time, dropping to about 18 tons a day in the summer, when many of the retirement community residents leave their suburban <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> homes for cooler climes. In 1987, the 10 <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clubs </ORGANIZATION> collected $ 335,000 from the sale of the old newspapers, and after paying $ 132,000 for loading, shipping, string to tie the bundles and leases for their collection sites, earned a net profit from the newspaper recycling of just over $ 200,000. It may not be as profitable this year. In November 1987, old newsprint was selling for $ 54.70 per ton. This year, because of increased competition from city governments who have turned to recycling, and a cutback in export sales of recyclable paper, the market price is down to $ 28.40 per ton. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Higginbotham </PERSON>, 79, who retired about 30 years ago, started the project 20 years ago when <ORGANIZATION> Host </ORGANIZATION> was the only <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> here. As more clubs were formed, <PERSON> Higginbotham </PERSON> involved them in the project. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gravlin </PERSON>, 72, is running the project now, with help from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON>, 69. <PERSON> Higginbotham </PERSON> was one of the first residents of the retirement community started by <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, buying in before the first house was completed. `` The good Lord's been good to me, and this is a way I can give something back,'' <PERSON> Higginbotham </PERSON> says. `` It's only fair to do that.'' <PERSON> Gravlin </PERSON>, who ran the marketing division of a major shoe manufacturer before retiring, says its a good way to keep active. He says the retirees have been through the pressure years of earning a living, and now that they have time available, they can turn their attention to helping others. `` Helping others is a moral obligation that every human being has,'' he says. `` Some accept it and some do n't.'' <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON>, who ran a department store in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> before he retired, and a men's shop in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> after his retirement, is getting set to take over the operation. `` We return something to the community,'' he says. `` That gives us a good feeling. We're not just sitting around.'' <PERSON> Higginbotham </PERSON> was involved in construction, railroading, real estate and the hotel-motel industry before moving to <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` We built three buildings with the money we got for the newspapers,'' he says. <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Webb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> donated the land, but the <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION> paid the $ 330,000 cost of construction. `` We've got a dozen charities that we've given the space to, for $ 1 a year,'' he says. `` A financial consultant told us three months ago that, judging by what office space is renting for, we're saving the charities about $ 80,000 a year in rent. That's $ 80,000 more they can use to help others.'' Money from the newspaper recycling is added to funds collected by other Lions Clubs in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> to support their special mountain camp for handicapped children. `` There is one counselor for every two handicapped camper,'' <PERSON> Gravlin </PERSON> says. `` It's a great experience for them.'' Newspaper recycling profits are also invested in El Mirage Schools, for an anti-drug program that <PERSON> Gravlin </PERSON> says is credited by school officials with reducing the dropout rate in the distrct.

 If you're under 50, skip this story. If you read it, you may wish you were older. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rattner </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilman </PERSON> _ who is over 50 _ has compiled a book of bargains for those born at least half a century ago, with information varying from hotel, motel and restaurant discounts to over-50 bike tours and ski clubs. Titled `` Unbelievably Good Deals and Great Adventures That You Absolutely Ca n't Get Unless You're Over 50'' -LRB- Contemporary Books -RRB-, the paperback also deals with travel and tour tips, breaks on airfare and car rentals, perks in parks, even going back to school. The idea for the book started with Ms. <PERSON> Heilman </PERSON>'s national magazine article, which got a response indicating `` everybody is interested'' in the subject, she says. With about one-quarter of the nation's population in the over-50 category, `` everybody is jumping on the bandwagon and there are new things all the time,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Heilman </PERSON>. She has updated the original 1988 book with some new `` deals'' for a 1989 edition. `` On your 50th birthday,'' Ms. <PERSON> Heilman </PERSON> writes, `` you qualify for hundreds of special opportunities and money-saving offers that will have lots of people wishing they were older. All for a couple of good reasons. `` First, you deserve them, having successfully negotiated your way through life's white waters. `` And second, as the fastest-growing segment of the American population, you represent an enormous market of potential consumers, a fact that has become quite apparent to the business community.'' Her biggest piece of advice: `` Make a practice of asking if there are breaks to which you are entitled wherever you go, from movies to museums, concerts to historic sites, hotels to ski resorts, restaurants to riverboats, in this country and abroad. Do n't expect clerks or ticket agents to volunteer them to you.'' She adds: `` Remember to request your privileges before you pay or when you order or make reservations, and always carry proof of age or an over-50-club membership card, or, better yet, both.''

 Millions of mature Americans are spending their time, independence and money on traveling in recreation vehicles, reports a national association for the retired. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- estimates that nine million senior Americans use recreation vehicles each year. `` Mature travelers are good candidates for RV travel,'' says <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Noe </PERSON>, member services specialist for <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION>, `` because many have the time, discretionary funds and desire to see and experience the small towns, big cities, popular attractions and natural beauty of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` RVs provide them with an enjoyable, comfortable and economical way to take it all in and enjoy the social benefits of camaraderie on the road.'' A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> survey of the recreation vehicle consumer reported that nearly 10 percent of heads of households over 50 who own vehicles own 30 percent of the RVs in use. <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> reports that RV trips account for 18 percent of all trips taken by those in the 55-59 age group. Seventy-two percent of all RV trips are made by travelers 50 years and older, <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> says. Recreation vehicles include motor homes, travel trailers, truck campers, folding camping trailers and van conversions.

 Older drivers pose a greater risk of being involved in accidents but driving should not be restricted solely on the basis of age, says a recent government study. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> says roadway signs and markings should be redesigned to better meet the needs of older drivers, and that screening should be improved to identify impaired drivers of all ages. The report urges states to tighten their screening programs and issue restricted licenses in some cases such as limiting certain applicants to daytime driving only. It criticized a movement in some states to allow drivers licenses to be renewed by mail without drivers being required to undergo vision tests at least every four years. But the study concluded that `` age alone is a poor predictor of the -LRB- driving -RRB- performance of any individual,'' although acknowledging after age 75 a driver is `` about twice as likely -LRB- per mile driven -RRB- to be involved in a crash'' as middle-aged drivers. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> panel, composed of experts assembled by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, spent two years examining questions about transportation and the elderly. It said problems of meeting the transportation needs of older citizens will increase in the years ahead as the numer of people over 75 increases and more elderly people live in the suburbs where less public transportation is available. `` The states are not prepared to handle the growing number of very old drivers or to identify those at high risk of accident involvement,'' the study concluded. `` Most older persons will probably be quite capable and safe drivers. But current statistics indicate that drivers 75 and over are more at risk of crash involvement than the average driver. ... Thes facts must be acknowledged even though there is no justification for restricting driving on the basis of age alone.'' Furthermore, the panel said, elderly people are more likely to suffer serious or fatal injuries than other drivers in accidents of similar severity. The study said elderly people, especially those 75 years or older, often have problems reading traffic signs, seeing clearly at night, gauging traffic flow when merging into traffic or making left turns, and turning their heads when backing their vehicles. But `` when examined in terms of incidents, the problem that older persons represent to overall traffic safety is small relative to that of the -LRB- teen-age -RRB- driver,'' the committee wrote. The panel encouraged older drivers to buy automobiles equipped with air bags, the devices that inflate automatically to protect the head and upper torso in a crash. The committee also urged the use of seat belts, but suggested manufacturers could make them more comfortable and easier to use. It also suggested that roadway markings and signs be made larger or brighter. It said the current road sign standard currently exceeds the visual ability of about 40 percent of drivers who are 65 years or older. Even with various design improvements in the coming years, an increasing number of older people will require public transportation. Communities should improve public transit for the elderly, develop subsidized taxi programs and construct walkways in suburban areas if the transportation requirements of the elderly are to be met, the study said.

 Older adults generally do not have to give up driving because of aging changes in vision _ but they should recognize their limitations, advises the American <ORGANIZATION> Optometric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. More than 37 million Americans over 55 years old drive, and according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> they have a poorer accident record than drivers in their middle years. Failure to yield right-of-way, improper lane changes, passing and turning are among the most common traffic violations committed by older drivers, national studies have shown. According to the optometrists, changes in vision may interfere with older drivers' abilities to see and recognize what is on the road ahead, to see effectively at night, to see against the glare of oncoming headlights and to recover quickly from glare. Other factors include faulty judging of distances between themselves and other vehicles or objects, and the detection of movement from the side while looking straight ahead. Suggestions from the optometrists on how older drivers can compensate for vision changes include: _ Avoid driving at dusk. _ When driving at night, reduce speed, try to limit driving to well-lighted or familiar roads, and keep headlights, taillights and turn signals clean and properly adjusted. _ Take time to adjust to a new eyeglass or contact lens prescription before driving. _ Avoid frames with wide side pieces that may block side vision. _ Wear quality sunglasses on sunny or bright, cloudy days, but never wear sunglasses, or fashion-tinted lenses, when driving at night. _ Confine driving to places, speeds and hours in which they are comfortable and competent. _ Avoid pulling off alongside the highway. If necessary, use the car's four-way emergency flashers. _ Keep windshield and rear windows clean, inside and out, and replace worn wiper blades promptly. _ Keep rear view and outside mirrors clean and properly adjusted. Be aware of their limitations.

 Elderly Americans living alone were more likely to still be alive two years later than those who made their home with someone other than a spouse, a government researcher has reported. More than three-quarters of them also were still living independently after two years, said Dr. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovar </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. Her findings are based on interviews in 1984 and 1986 with people who had been aged 70 and over in 1984. `` The most important thing is the stability. Most of these people, two years later, are still living in the community. Those who were living alone are still alone, and those with someone else are still with someone else,'' <PERSON> Kovar </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` As you would expect, because these people are 72 or older, death rates are high. But relatively few of them are in nursing homes,'' she said. Of nearly 6.4 million elderly Americans living alone in 1984, 89.8 percent were still alive two years later, the study found. By comparison, 87.3 percent of those living with others survived two years. Those living with a spouse did nearly as well as those alone, 89.0 percent surviving. But, of those living with someone else _ friends or family _ only 84.3 percent were still alive. People living with brothers and sisters tended to live longer, but that may have been because longevity ran in the family, <PERSON> Kovar </PERSON> speculated. Of those who had been on their own in 1984, 77.8 percent were still living by themselves in 1986, she found. About 7.4 percent of them had moved in with someone else _ most often family _ and 4.6 percent were in an institution. `` It certainly appears that for some of them life is better'' two years later, <PERSON> Kovar </PERSON> said. `` Some have remarried ... and when we asked those who had moved why ... we got'' answers ranging from health to being nearer to children to spending the summer in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and winter in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. One, she commented, even cited lower golf fees for moving. A major factor in continued independence is likely that those living alone were more healthy at the start of the study, she concluded in the report, `` Aging in the Eighties, People Living Alone _ Two Years Later.''

 More than 40 percent of nursing homes failed to meet sanitary standards for food and nearly 30 percent failed to meet standards for maintaining residents' personal cleanliness, according to the federal government's first consumer guide to nursing homes. The survey also found that more than one-fourth of the nursing homes do not administer drugs properly. However, Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> that compiled and released the statistics, cautioned against reading more into the figures than is warranted. `` This is not the ultimate report card for nursing homes around the country,'' <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> told reporters. He said the `` met-unmet'' criteria for each of the 32 categories included in the state-by-state reports contains no measure of severity and represented a one-time `` snapshot'' of conditions at the nursing home's most recent unannounced inspection. To some degree, he said, it relied on the subjective judgment of the inspector. At the same time, <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> defended release of the report against industry criticism that it would mislead consumers. One complaint was, for example, that a nursing home might be given an `` unmet'' mark on proper administration of medication if one patient was five minutes late getting his or her medicine. `` If one person was five minutes late, I'm sure they would not have been dinged in the survey,'' <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> said. `` What we're looking at, what the surveyors look at is the pattern of care over time. `` We are not in the business of making arbitrary, bureaucratic judgments. We are trying to evaluate what is really happening to people in that nursing home.'' He added: `` What we are looking for ... is not nursing home providers that barely scrape by. We're looking for people who are good providers, consistently, over time, 365 days a year. And I have to believe that if that's where a nursing home operator has his or her nursing home, they are not going to be worried about being dinged on some trivial point.'' The 75-volume guide shows how each of the 15,000 nursing homes fared on 32 health, safety and care standards based on periodic inspections by state agencies. About 2,400 of the 15,000 received passing marks in all 32 categories. According to the survey, nearly 43 percent of the homes failed to meet sanitary standards for food. Almost 30 percent failed to meet standards for maintaining residents' personal cleanliness and 29 percent failed to administer drugs according to doctors' orders. However, the report also said that only a small percentage of the nursing homes failed to meet standards in many other categories. Overall among skilled homes, the failure rate exceeded 15 percent in only 10 categories. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Willging </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents more than 9,000 nursing homes, said the report `` is misleading _ it is going to confuse the public'' by making it appear conditions are worse than they are. He said that something like a cracked egg in a refrigerator could lead to a nursing home failing to meet a care standard. But <PERSON> Elma </PERSON> <PERSON> Holder </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> on Nursing Home Reform, said: `` We think the national statistics are misleading Conditions are worse.''

 The focus on Alzheimer's disease generally is on the patients, not their families. But a new program uses coloring books, a mascot dog and movies to show elementary school pupils how the debilitating ailment can be battled. For a few hours, the students put aside their reading, writing and arithmetic to look at a disease that may not afflict them for 60 years, if at all. The purpose of the effort is not so much to understand how the disease works but to show how the loved ones of an Alzheimer's sufferer can, with patience, helpful advice and love, minimize the worst of the disease's effects Alzheimer's, characterized by memory loss and other dementia, afflicts an estimated 5 million mostly elderly Americans. The southern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, which is in the third year of a federal <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> grant intended to promote community programs, developed the daylong seminar on Alzheimer's after meetings between school officials and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> of New Jersey-based <ORGANIZATION> Sandoz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, who spends summers there. <ORGANIZATION> Sandoz </ORGANIZATION> manufactures Hydergine, a drug that can ease some symptoms of Alzheimer's in milder cases. <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION> changed the emphasis because of mounting evidence that children are often acutely aware of and confused by the decline of a loved one. A coloring book titled `` Helping Grandma,'' by <ORGANIZATION> Westport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> art teacher <PERSON> Betsey </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, told the story of a grandmother who gradually begins to show signs of memory loss. `` Children are often kept in the dark about aging,'' said <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>. `` They automatically think that ` old' means ` sick.' But children are wonderfully resilient and surprisingly insightful when spoken to directly on the subject.'' The point of the coloring book, geared toward elementary school children, is to `` teach them understanding and to teach them that what she needs is support.'' Also, mature, well-behaved dogs from an animal shelter can provide some stability and love for an Alzheimer's sufferer, <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON>, a black and white mongrel from a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> animal shelter, has become the national poster dog for the so-called human-animal bonding campaign, and he travels with <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> to events on the subject.

 Women can help prevent brittle bones in old age by regularly consuming dairy products throughout their lives, but calcium supplements taken after menopause probably wo n't be effective, researchers say. In a study in the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, researchers said the key factors in bone density among post-menopausal women were lifelong calcium intake and the naturally occurring hormone estrone. Moderate exercise and calcium supplements taken later in life do not appear to prevent osteoporosis, a frequently debilitating disease most common among women in which the bones become thinner and more brittle, they found. `` Swallowing calcium pills at 50 years of age probably is not going to make your bones thicker,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuller </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Epidemiology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kuller </PERSON>, a co-author of the study involving 174 healthy post-menopausal women over a four-year period, also said, `` There is no evidence that moderate exercise in these women increased their bone density.'' `` The most important message ... is that an adequate calcium intake during childhood, adolescence, post-adolescence and the reproductive years is probably a very important part of good health and will probably help prevent bone fracture and osteoporosis,'' he said. Osteoporosis results in a loss of bone density and can lead to bone fractures and spinal problems like dowager's hump. Some estimates project that by age 70, one-quarter of the women in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will have suffered a fracture related to the disease.

 Use the rubber end of a pencil or pen to push the buttons of a telephone or turn the pages of a book. Use an electric stapler to help reduce fatigue in hands, wrists and shoulders. If you are n't up to typing, use a dictating machine. These are among suggestions for office workers who suffer from arthritis to help ease their work. The advice comes from <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, who has had rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis for nearly 20 years and is now a volunteer counselor for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> chapter of the Arthritis Foundation. `` Until recently,'' she said in a recent issue of AIMplus, an arthritis information magazine, `` people with arthritis found it very difficult to keep on working _ not because they did n't want to, but because the attitude of society in generally has been that a disabled person ` just could n't do the job.''' While attitudes have changed, she said, and many disabled persons are finding less difficulty in finding and keeping a job, `` some people with arthritis may find that their condition does somewhat limit their abilities to accomplish as much as they would like.'' She offers some other suggestions to ease that problem: _ Conserve energy by planning ahead; schedule the more demanding tasks for times of day when you are feeling your best. _ Make sure your chair provides firm support for your lower back and has armrests to help reduce fatigue in your shoulders. The chair should be high enough to get in and out of without strain, and low enough so you do n't have to hunch over while working. _ To ease strain on your neck, place text on a tying rack rather than keeping it flat beside your desk.

 Collecting, from toy soldiers to vintage perfume bottles, is one way for grandparents to share a hobby or activity with their grandchildren. `` The important thing is that it's a shared activity, a special bond between you and your grandchild,'' says <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Roedler </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiques </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` What's more, when you explore the past together, your grandchild gets a window into former times and can better appreciate your world, too.'' The collection can also encourage other activities, he says, both with the grandchild and on your own. It could mean enrolling in courses or seminars and sharing the learning with the grandchildren. Museums and galleries, magazines and journals are other resources, he says. <PERSON> Roedler </PERSON> says there are numerous local clubs for collectors, where news and information is exchanged. He suggests the possibility of a club for grandparent-grandchild collectors.

 When it comes to shopping, mature consumers prefer the old-fashioned way _ walking around the stores, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study. The Baylor researchers said the `` gray marketers,'' 55 years or older, like to see what that are buying before they part with their money and thus go to the stores rather than order from mailed catalogs or television or telephone. `` Many of them actually prefer the social aspects of going shopping,'' says <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Selling </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hankamer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` They like walking the shops and meeting people. Getting out of the house is something they look forward to,'' she says. She conducted the year-long survey with <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chonko </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and former <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> faculty member <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumpkin </PERSON>, now a marketing professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION>. The study, `` Direct Marketing to the Elderly: Sources of Dissatisfaction and Remedies,'' was funded by the <ORGANIZATION> Andrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>. Sixty percent of the more than 4,000 people surveyed were in the 65-plus age category; 20 percent in the 55-64 age group, and 20 percent were adults up to age 54. More than 2,500 responded to the survey. The study also found that the elderly strongly prefer the `` personal touch'' from sales people and dislike `` high pressure'' sales tactics. The survey had some advice for those doing the selling as well. `` Be patient with the elderly,'' <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> suggested. `` Do n't assume because of their age that they can not understand complex information They grasp things just like everybody else, but it may take them longer. `` Do n't give them too much clutter to wade through. Their eyesight may not be quite as good; use larger type in your printed material, slow down in your approach, simplify, and, above all, never think of the elderly as ` senile' or ` cranky' in their ways,'' she says. `` They resent these stereotypes.''

 After the children grow up and leave home, there may be a problem left over: what to do about the piano. Do n't let it just sit in a corner of the living room gathering dust, says the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Piano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which suggests parents of adult children who have left the nest can find many enjoyable ways to keep the piano an important part of their homes. A piano is not only a beautiful piece of furniture, but it represents an investment, both in time and money, according to the foundation. `` There are a lot of memories attached to our piano,'' says <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Krouse </PERSON>, a publisher from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, who bought the family piano with his wife, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, when they were first married. `` Even though my eldest daughter _ our piano enthusiast _ has moved out of the area, I would n't dream of giving it up.'' Although the Krouses are not piano players themselves, they have kept it in frequent use by hiring pianists to play at several parties they've hosted. And they have a few friends who play the piano when they visit. One way to enjoy your piano after the kids have stopped playing, suggests the foundation, is to take lessons yourself. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevitz </PERSON>, a retired mechanical engineer in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, recently began piano lessons, marking the first time he's studied piano in nearly 50 years and the first time his piano has been used regularly since his stepdaughter moved out of the house `` When I retired I had all this new-found free time,'' says <PERSON> Sevitz </PERSON>. `` And the piano was n't getting much use, so I decided it was a good time to learn to play _ something I've wanted to do all my life.'' <PERSON> Sevitz </PERSON> signed up for a piano class in beginning techniques with <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Giles </PERSON>, head of the piano department at <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> teaches many adult students, as well as the college's regular student body, and finds that playing piano is something for which `` empty-nesters'' and recent retirees are perfectly suited `` Older people make excellent piano students,'' says <PERSON> Giles </PERSON>. `` Those who are retired, of course, have a lot of free time, too. But even working adults can fit piano study into their schedules and budgets.''

 Depending on where they work, aging white-collar workers face a job outlook ranging from `` crash-and-burn'' to a possible triple career ladder, according to a study of 25 `` Fortune 500'' companies. The state of the economy and the industry, the company `` personality,'' the nature of corporate leadership and the organizational structure were among the factors shaping company responses to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> survey. `` All of these factors can change over time, so you can not lock a company into a particular behavior pattern,'' says <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirshorn </PERSON>, research fellow at the university's Population Studies Center. `` It is clear, however, that a company under economic stress is much more likely to consider actions hurtful to older workers.'' Typical corporate responses indicated five distinct company policies toward elder employees, those over 55, <PERSON> Hirshorn </PERSON> notes. They were characterized as `` pro-active,'' `` performance-focused,'' `` at cross-purposes,'' `` positive means-negative ends'' and `` antagonistic.'' `` Pro-active'' companies deal most effectively with older workers, she explains, planning strategies that build in options for workers at all ages as well as options for the company as a whole. `` Dual or even triple career ladders are not uncommon in pro-active companies,'' she adds. `` They encourage lateral career changes and intentionally reassign workers at all ages to relieve boredom and stress.'' <PERSON> Hirshorn </PERSON> says `` performance-focused'' companies try to ignore age as a criterion altogether, consistently applying a reliable evaluation system to all workers. But occasionally, companies are at cross-purposes in their policies, she notes. `` The company ethos may hold older workers in high regard, and managers may even design some effective policies for them,'' she says. `` At the same time, they are designing others that have an unfortunate effect ... They do n't coordinate policies and plan for change.'' An example of such cross-purposes would be companies that offer limited opportunities for promotion or lateral moves, and massive, sweetened early retirement programs. Some companies are actively antagonistic toward older workers, and the hostility shows up in a variety of policies, <PERSON> Hirshorn </PERSON> found. `` I came across one insurance company where age bias ran deeply throughout the ranks,'' she recalls. `` Those who refused to relocate were fired, and since so few employees over 55 were promoted, many older workers left.''

 Much of the GI generation that fought in World War II and returned home to create an economic and baby boom is retiring in relative comfort, a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> researcher has reported. More than half of retirees age 65 to 74 have income at double the poverty level, and 12 percent form an elite with income from at least three sources, according to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>. But elderly affluence is n't spread evenly across the nation, <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> reported in American Demographics magazine. `` There are a cluster of states with a large share of the comfortably retired,'' <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> said in analyzing 1980 Census data, the most recent information available with sufficient detail for the study. <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> had many of the comfortably retired, while the pension elite made strong showings in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> found. The poverty level for a family of four was $ 8,414 in 1980. The World War II GIs reaped the benefits of government programs that provided educations and home loans, cost-of-living escalators for their <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> benefits and federal laws protecting private pensions, <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> noted. In addition, many were able to invest in stocks and bonds in a time of booming economy. <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> looked at three groups of retirees in his study, those aged 55 to 64, 65-74 and 75 and over in 1980. He termed them the GI generation after the term `` Government Issue,'' which became a popular tag for soldiers in the 1940s. Just over half -LRB- 51.1 percent -RRB- of those in the 65-74 age group were listed as comfortable, and 12.3 percent were in the `` elite elite.'' For the younger group, 59.1 percent were comfortable and 4.7 percent were in the elite. They were less likely to qualify as elite since few were receiving Social Security in addition to other retirement benefits. The oldest group listed 37.5 percent as comfortable and 8.5 percent as elite. Few in this group had income-generating assets and most completed a large share of their working lives before World War II, when pension benefits were less common and lower. <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> found the confortably retired of the 65-74 age group in such resort and retirement states as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>; in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, where many <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> executives have retired, and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> has a large <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> population where extended families are more common, a situation which boosts the household income measure used as the basis for this calculation, <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> noted. For the pension elite, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> placed well, as did <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> also noted that there are clusters of affluent elderly in some metropolitan areas. He cited as examples <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; and along the east coast of <LOCATION> Mobile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> is director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in Aging at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>, and his work was partially funded by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION> American Demographics, published by <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, reports on population matters

 The dollar was higher in thin trading in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> late this morning, but traders said they expected no major movement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency ahead of Wednesday's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for October. Gold prices also rose. Trading volume was light with few players keen to take a strong position before the trade figures are released and in advance of the bi-weekly meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, when the West German central bank could decide to raise a key interest rate, dealers said. One trader with a branch of a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial bank in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> said the foreign exchange market expects the October trade deficit to be little changed from its $ 10.5-billion shortfall in September. She said a single-figure deficit would `` clearly be positive'' for the dollar, but cautioned that `` we've seen this year that this figure is pretty difficult to call accurately.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.49 yen to a closing 122.92 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 122.85 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.7378 West German marks, up from 1.7330; 1.4645 Swiss francs, up from 1.4605; 5.9415 French francs, up from 5.9240; 1.9622 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9560; 1,283.20 Italian lire, up from 1,280.25; 1.1988 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1970 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.8420, compared with $ 1.8490 Friday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 421 a troy ounce, up from $ 420.70 bid late Friday. At midmorning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 421, unchanged from the opening bid. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 421 up from $ 420.30 bid late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 2.10 to close at a bid $ 422.29. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today at a bid price of $ 6.16 a troy ounce, unchanged from Friday.

 Share prices plunged on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> today, while the dollar edged up against the Japanese yen as investors remained on the sidelines ahead of trade reports, dealers said. The dollar closed at 122.92 yen, up 0.49 yen from Friday's close of 122.43 yen. The currency opened at 122.70 yen and traded between 122.70-123 .00 yen The 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> lost 121.13 points or 0.41 percent to finish trading at 29,672.29. The index, a 34.52-point winner Friday, gained 40.35 points in early morning trading but erased the gain and continued to drop. The dollar's higher opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed its firmness in the <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> market that opened earlier, dealers said. The dollar moved higher as foreign investors purchased the currency in morning trading but fluctuated around 122.80 yen, failing to rise beyond the 123-yen level, said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` Once it reached the upper part of the 122-yen range, the dollar hardly moved,'' the dealer said.

 <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s major trade unions, unhappy over the economic austerity of Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s government, are taking to the streets to demand a bigger share in the country's new prosperity A broad spectrum of society _ including autoworkers, actresses, soccer players and sportswriters _ say they will support Wednesday's general strike called by the socialist <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the communist-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Strike organizers say they want to bring the country of 38 million to a standstill to force a change in the government's economic policies The unions also called for a demonstration on Friday in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and said if the government does not respond, more demonstrations will follow. Since taking office in December 1982, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has encouraged moderate wage increases to stem inflation, prod economic growth and create jobs to cut <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s 19.3 percent unemployment rate _ the highest in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Due partly to lower wage increases backed in the past by the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has been booming since 1986. More than 600,000 new jobs have been created, although growing numbers of youths and women entering the market have kept unemployment high. Annual inflation has dropped from 14.5 percent to 5.1 percent. There have been reports of huge profits by Spanish banks and corporations. Now, the unions are demanding a share of the wealth for workers who sacrificed higher pay in the past few years to help pull <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> out of a 10-year economic recession. The causes of the economic problems included the sharp rise in oil prices after the oil embargo of the early 1970s, when <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s energy needs were met by imported crude, and protectionism under <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s 1939-1975 rule What set off the strike call was the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>' passage Oct. 28 of a youth employment plan It allows businesses who hire 18 - to 25-year-olds for six to eight months at wages below the minimum to reduce their contributions to the government social security plan The government said the plan will create incentives to hire youths. An estimated 40 percent of the age group have never held a job. Unions say the plan exploits young people, benefits businesses, and jeopardizes jobs and pay for older workers. The nationwide general strike would be the first in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> since October 1934, when a leftist-inspired work stoppage turned into an insurrection that was put down by troops commanded by Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> under orders from the then-conservative government of the Second Republic. Analysts do not expect violence this time, but the feud between union leaders and top <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials has taken on the hallmarks of a dramatic showdown. <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Redondo </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, has compared remarks from <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Benegas </PERSON> criticizing the planned strike to comments by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> propaganda chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Goebbels </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, in turn, has accused the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> of `` sliding toward the red,'' falling under the influence of the more combative communist union. When right-wing and centrist opposition parties, with <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> support, tried to pass a motion to urge the unions to call off the strike, two small leftist parties voted against it. Approval required a unanimous vote. Newspapers described the incident as a sign of the ineffectiveness of the parties and parliament in breaking the union-government impasse. After union-government wage talks broke down in the autumn, the unions began accusing the <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> government of arrogance and lack of `` social sensitivity.'' In a recent news conference, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> acknowledged that some arrogance could have creeped into his government but said this was no reason to stage a general strike.

<HEAD>Tenneco Still Profitable After Oil and Gas Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The decision to sell off <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was a difficult one, but the mammoth $ 7.3 billion sale still leaves <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> with five profitable businesses. After the sale, the Houston-based company remains the city's largest public company, with 1988 revenue close to $ 13 billion, and projected revenue of about $ 14 billion in 1990 `` I think it will surprise a lot of people to realize that we are as big as this without the oil company,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> said in a wide-ranging interview published in Sunday's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> sale was difficult not only because of the impact on the nearly 9,000 oil company and corporate employees involved, but also because of <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s new identity as a `` diversified industrial corporation.'' The company's other businesses include shipbuilding, automotive, chemicals, packaging and natural gas pipeline operations, which are all making money. One business making money is Case IH, the construction and farm equipment company that <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> formed in 1985 when JI Case acquired the agricultural implement division of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harvester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 513 million. Since then, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> has plowed more than $ 700 million in capital expenditures into the subsidiary. Case IH has become the company's biggest business, but it has yet to show a profit <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> has designated 1989 as the make-or-break year for Case IH. If the profit are not there, Case IH could have a `` for sale'' sign hanging on its corporate door. But <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Khlopin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> doubts that <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> has plans to divest any other operations. `` Nothing this company has said has led anyone to believe they would sell anything other than exploration and production,'' he said. `` They're building up, not ripping down.'' Although Case IH's performance has fallen short of expectations, <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> said, the Harvester acquisition and the subsequent consolidation and reorganization of Case IH were planned as a five-year project. What the company did not count on was the recession in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm belt that resulted in North American tractor sales falling from 90,000 in 1984 to 61,000 in 1986 and 1987, or last summer's drought that made many farmers postpone new equipment purchases. To help matters, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> installed a new management team at the Case IH headquarters in <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis </LOCATION>. The new president, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashford </PERSON>, previously headed <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION>, which more than doubled its operating income during his five years as the top executive. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s other business segments are demonstrating growth and improved profit at rates ranging from modest to booming, <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> said. Natural gas transmission is <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s original business and its second largest source of revenue after agricultural and construction equipment. Since the natural gas transmission industry is mature, overall growth opportunities are limited, he said. Nevertheless, the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> is a consistently strong earner and supplier of cash flow, <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> said. Its 20,000-mile system from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> serves one of the two areas where demand for natural gas is growing. Increases in federal defense spending since 1981 have helped <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> grow at a compound annual rate of 15.6 percent, but <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> acknowledged that defense expenditures probably will be cut in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. An $ 8 billion backlog that includes construction of two aircraft carriers and two submarines, along with future contracts for modernization and upgrading of existing <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels, should ensure at least incremental growth, the <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> chairman said. Packaging Corporation of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> offers the best potential for solid growth, <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> said. Although it is the second-smallest <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> unit by revenues, <ORGANIZATION> PCA </ORGANIZATION> should have the second-highest operating profits for 1988 and should grow at an annual rate of 15 percent to 20 percent over the next five years, he said. Cardboard boxes are <ORGANIZATION> PCA </ORGANIZATION>'s primary product. <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> said $ 65 million of <ORGANIZATION> PCA </ORGANIZATION>'s projected 1988 operating income of $ 220 million will come from specialty products the company did not make five years ago. <PERSON> Albright </PERSON> & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a specialty chemicals producer and <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s smallest subsidiary, should grow an average of 20 percent for the next five years, the chairman said. <PERSON> Albright </PERSON> & amp; <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is a major supplier of phosphates for detergents, soaps and shampoos, primarily in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and is the world's largest producer of sodium chlorate, used to bleach paper products. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> has grown at a 13 percent rate for the past five years and is the leading manufacturer of mufflers, exhaust systems and shock absorbers for the replacement parts and accessories market. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s other two major business segments _ natural gas pipelines and shipbuilding _ also will be solid performers, though not as the others, <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Reports Raise Hopes that Higher Interest Rates Are Working</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Retail sales fell by a larger-than-expected 0.5 percent in November as producer prices rose 0.3 percent, less than forecast, the government said Monday, raising hopes that higher interest rates were slowing down consumer spending and inflation. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 7.5 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,742.8 after the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> issued its two reports late in the morning. But the index had been down as much as 11.8 points shortly before the economic figures were released. The pound held steady at about $ 1.8405. Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> pushed up interest rates to 13 percent from a decade low of 7.5 percent in June to discourage consumer spending and curb inflation, which has picked up to an annual rate of 6.4 percent from 3.3 percent in January. Private economists had forecast a rise or fall of 0.2 percent in retail sales and a 0.4-percent gain in producer prices. `` There are fairly clear signs that growth in retail sales is a lot slower than it was earlier this year,'' said economist <PERSON> Gwyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hacche </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's in the right direction.'' But he added: `` I would n't expect there to be clear evidence of the kind of slowdown we want probably for a few months. Really, the growth has got to come down quite a lot further.'' Retail sales were up 5.2 percent from November 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said. By comparison, retail sales volume rose 2.0 percent in October from the previous month and was up 6.2 percent from a year earlier. Producer output prices, or prices of manufactured goods, were up 4.8 percent from November 1987, the department reported. By comparison, output prices rose 0.4 percent in October from the previous month and were up 4.7 percent from a year earlier. These figures were n't seasonally adjusted.

 The number of working oil and gas rigs increased by 17 this week to total 922, ending a period of decline marked by price instability, industry watcher <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported. Monday's increase followed a two-week period in which the number of working rigs dropped by 18. Last week, the count dropped by six to total 905. A year ago the count was 1,181, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said Monday. The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil toolmaker company that merged with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the number of working rigs since 1940. In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures. The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2. Among major oil producing states, the biggest gains were posted by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, with seven additional rigs, followed by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, three; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, two each; and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, one each. <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> had the greatest decline with three fewer rigs, followed by <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, with one each. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> was unchanged from the previous week.

The index moved down as much as 11.8 points shortly before the economic figures were released. Volume was light, as 230.1 million shares changed hands by midday, compared with 320.4 million at the same time Friday. A separate report on British producer output prices showed a rise of 0.3 percent in November from October and of 4.8 percent from November 1987. These figures, at the bottom end of market expectations, also were favorable, dealers said.

<HEAD>Church's Chicken Decides To Close Unprofitable Units</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Church's Fried Chicken, embroiled in a battle to prevent a hostile takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Popeyes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Famous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> and Biscuits, announced today it would immediately close 120 of its stores, whose losses have totaled $ 7.4 million in the past year. `` Our decision to close certain unprofitable stores within the Church's system will have a positive effect on cash flow,'' <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON>, president and chief financial officer of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio-based </LOCATION> company, said in a statement. `` The closings are an important part of our plan to improve profitability of Church's,'' he said. The closings will be in 20 states. In the statement, <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON> said the closings would allow for between $ 22 million and $ 27 million in write-offs for this fiscal year. Church's, which has gone through several management changes in the past two years, currently has about 1,500 restaurants and is second in the fast-food chicken industry behind <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>. Popeyes is third in the industry with about 725 restaurants. Church's expects to see sales this year of $ 520 million, down from $ 570 million in 1986 and $ 633 million in 1984. Popeyes is expected to have sales of $ 485 million this year. The restaurant closings come at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s is in the midst of a takeover battle with New Orleans-based Popeyes, which has made an $ 8-per-share, $ 290 million unsolicited bid for Church's. Church's board of directors has rejected the offer as inadequate. The company also claims that former <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s employees gave Popeyes confidential information which it used in the takeover bid. A federal judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> earlier this month issued an order preventing Popeyes' owner <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> from buying <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s stock until 10 working days after Popeyes revealed information on its buyout offer. Popeyes' first takeover deadline was Nov. 30, but has been extended to Friday. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> says he already owns 3.2 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s stock and has been offered 14.6 million shares _ or about 40.6 percent _ of the 35.9 million outstanding shares of <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s stock Meanwhile, Church's has been courting offers from other investors, but also has become the subject of a class-action suit filed by a shareholder who claims the offer by Popeyes is adequate and that the Church's board's refusal to accept it could cost shareholders huge profits.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Societe </PERSON> <PERSON> Generale </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Belgique </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s largest holding company, Monday forecast a loss of between 500 million and 2 billion Belgian francs _ between $ 13.5 and $ 54 million _ this year due to restructuring costs But the company said it expected much better results next year, possibly more than doubling the 3.611 billion francs, or $ 97.5 million, profit made last year. <ORGANIZATION> SGB </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that its operating results would have totaled about 10 billion francs, or $ 270.2 million, in 1988 if restructuring costs were not subtracted. Those costs, however, were estimated to be between 10.5 billion francs and 12 billion francs, or the equivalent of $ 283.8 to $ 324.3 million, wiping out the profit and leaving the estimated loss of 500 million to 2 billion francs. The company predicted that it would post operating results of about 12 billion francs in 1989 but declined to give a specific net profit forecast because the extent of restructuring costs was uncertain for that year. Meanwhile in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, French company <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>, now the leading <ORGANIZATION> SGB </ORGANIZATION> shareholder, announced that that <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Electricite </ORGANIZATION> would sell its 3.3 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> SGB </ORGANIZATION> in order to acquire a 2.8 percent holding. Belgian <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, second SGB shareholder, confirmed that Sodecom, the holding company which contained 42 percent of <ORGANIZATION> SGB </ORGANIZATION>, was being divided into three new units. One will be fully controlled by <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>, a second by <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> and the two companies will share the third. <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> said that an effort will be made to return 12 percent of <ORGANIZATION> SGB </ORGANIZATION> shares to the public. Only two percent are currently traded and an additional 5 percent is being placed with institutional investors.

<HEAD>Investor Group Offers Nearly $700 Million for Pennwalt Corp.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An investment partnership offered almost $ 700 million cash today for <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a large Philadelphia-based chemical concern that makes industrial products such as caustic soda and chlorine. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor group <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which already owns 12.7 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s approximately 7.6 million shares outstanding, said it would pay other stockholders $ 100 a share for the rest. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s stock rocketed higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after the announcement, from $ 83 at Friday's close to $ 98 a share around mid-day today. Company officials declined to comment on the offer. But <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>, a rumored takeover target for months, had taken several defensive steps to thwart any unwelcome suitors, including the $ 460 million sale of pharmaceutical operations three months ago and a stock repurchase completed last week. `` We believe that our offer represents a fair price and is in the best interest of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders,'' Centaur principals <PERSON> Abbey </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrin </PERSON> said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> management. The partners, who claimed to have assembled bank financing to make the purchase, said they were willing to negotiate any aspect of their offer including price. At the same time, the partners indicated they would resort to more hostile means to buy <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>, saying they had moved to invalidate the company's so-called `` poison pill'' shareholders rights plan with a lawsuit in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> federal court. The poison pill, which many companies have adopted, is designed to make an unwanted takeover prohibitively expensive. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> produces and markets industrial chemicals, and is a leading maker of chlorinated plastic, commonly used in building cable insulation. The company, which had sales of nearly $ 1.2 billion last year, also has operations in mineral and petroleum processing. In August, the company sold its pharmaceutical unit, maker of products such as Allerest allergy relief pills and Desenex foot powder, to the British firm <ORGANIZATION> Fisons </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> also repurchased about 37.6 percent of its outstanding stock as part of a plan to boost the price. Those moves were seen partly as a defensive move against <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION> principals <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Estrin </PERSON>, financiers who had indicated they might make an offer for <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, 51, is former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> and is president of C.B. <ORGANIZATION> Equities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based investment portfolio mangement company. <PERSON> Estrin </PERSON>, 45, is a Washington-based investor and former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a hospital and nursing home management concern.

 It has all the ingredients for the kind of soap opera television viewers love: an intriguing former prime minister, international big business and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> fighting for wealth and power. But this is not <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. This is <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. And a real-life battle for control of one or two new, commercial television channels is brewing in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s poorest nation. Most observers say former Social Democrat Prime Minister <PERSON> Fransisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON> <PERSON> Balsemao </PERSON>, publisher of the country's most respected weekly paper, Expresso, is in the best position to win the first concession. But British press baron <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> are also eager to profit by bringing information, opinion and, above all, advertising, into the homes of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s 10 million inhabitants. RTP, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s 32-year-old, two-channel state television system, already carries advertising. According to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Televisao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION>, the commercial arm of RTP, 72.9 percent of <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> watch TV every day. <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> says this is the highest rate in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The most popular programs _ usually early evening `` TV novels'' like `` <PERSON> Roque </PERSON> <PERSON> Santeiro </PERSON>'' imported from Portuguese-speaking <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> _ find up to 90 percent of the country's viewing population glued to the screen. `` There is certainly demand for more choice _ new stations,'' said <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, sales director at <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>, adding that many Portuguese, especially in poorer, isolated, rural areas have little other entertainment. `` They're all waiting for private TV because they think it will bring better programs.'' But some enterprising Portuguese can not wait. High-powered satellite dishes, capable of picking up neighboring <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s two programs and several Eurosatellite channels, have sprouted on more affluent rooftops in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oporto </LOCATION> and the southern Algarve. At 200,000 escudos -LRB- about $ 1,300 -RRB- per dish, the antennae are too expensive for the average Portuguese, whose minimum monthly wage is 27,100 escudos -LRB- $ 179 -RRB- _ about half that of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and a quarter of the minimum monthly wage in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Poorer areas often solve the problem by pooling cash to buy communal dishes that can pick up programs from abroad for easy _ but illegal _ retransmission by cable to individual homes. Plans to introduce commercial television via private extension of the regular network were first discussed in 1982 but only now are likely to become a reality. In October Social Democrat Prime Minister <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> and the main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> reached an agreement to secure the necessary two-thirds parliamentary majority on a vote expected next spring to change the constitutional clause that restricts private ownership of TV stations. But the government could set up new channels by concession now without having to transfer ownership. `` It's very much a question of political will,'' <PERSON> Balsemao </PERSON> said, and, according to <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, a new commercial channel could be up and running by the end of 1989. <PERSON> Balsemao </PERSON> has already attracted support from <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> publishing circles and a minority participation from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s independent <ORGANIZATION> Granada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION>, to register SIC _ <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION>. He sees privatization of RTP-2, the second state-owned channel, as the quickest way to bring commercial television to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. `` The longer the government waits, the more inroads foreign TV interests will make here, and the more difficult it will be for new <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> stations to break into the market.'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and publisher of a new European newspaper, could be one of the foreign interests. <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> has set up a joint venture with <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> communications concern <ORGANIZATION> Emaudio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> connected with Socialist President <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> and has already started to make inroads into the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> media market. `` Our principal objective is to control a regular TV channel, but we plan to go ahead with the launch of a Portuguese satellite channel by 1990 at the latest,'' <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Junqueiro </PERSON>, mastermind of <PERSON> Emaudio </PERSON>'s TV plans, said. Emaudio is already making headway in the expanding newspaper market here. Two weeks ago, it launched the first of two planned newspapers _ a non-glossy, investigative weekly called <PERSON> Primeira </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagina </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> plans to launch a daily called `` 24 Horas'' by the end of January. <PERSON> Magalhaes </PERSON> <PERSON> Crespo </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renascenca </ORGANIZATION>, the Church's nationwide radio network, and frontman for the future <ORGANIZATION> Televisao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION>, says the Church's position as a mainstay of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s education system gives it a right to own a TV channel Market surveys show 29 percent of adult listeners tune in to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renascenca </ORGANIZATION>, a figure twice that of the combined audience of its two state-owned competitors. But many are wary of the objectivity of a Church-controlled channel. `` It's true we are conservative in our outlook,'' <PERSON> Crespo </PERSON> said. `` But, in the case of our radio station, we never mix comment with information.'' More channels may not mean better television, <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` If these new channels want to make profits, they will have to resort to showing low-cost repeats of old films.'' It costs 10 times as much to produce a home-grown product, he said, than to buy a foreign import.

 When <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> says his latest project folded, it's not a matter for concern. All his schemes collapse by design. <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>, 55, is the founder and president of <ORGANIZATION> Structural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graphics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> company that specializes in print advertisements that pop up, play music and flash lights. His company's work has been displayed in millions of magazines, numerous sales brochures and store displays. It also has been featured in books and greeting cards, and hung from the ceilings and walls of businesses across the country. One recent pop-up advertisement his company produced for Camel cigarettes was used to mark that brand's 75th anniversary. Readers of the March issue of <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> magazine who opened up the advertising insert on page 16 had a cigarette-smoking camel pop up, while an electronic chip played `` Happy Birthday.'' <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>'s company produced 1.5 million such inserts, a sign of how far three-dimensional ads have come since Structural Graphics was established in 1976. The business began with fewer than a handful of employees in a colonial-style home in Old Lyme. <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>, whose background was in graphics and advertising, was convinced that 3-D ads deserved a place in business, and he went after skeptical advertising executives. `` I began pushing to get the advertising industry interested,'' he said during a recent interview. `` Now, they believe it works.'' <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> said the big break came in 1984, when his company designed an advertising insert for <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>'s `` <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>'' perfume in <LOCATION> Vogue </LOCATION> magazine. When a seal on the ad was broken, a bouqet of roses popped open and the smell of perfume was released. `` We had been primarily in direct mail until that time,'' <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> said, explaining his company is now deeply involved in magazine inserts. <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> says Structural Graphics is one of the largest companies in its field, but he declined to release sales figures for the privately owned firm. He said he produces between 50 million and 100 million 3-D pieces a year. A pop-up can cost as little as 15 cents or as much as $ 10 apiece. `` We get a kick out of just making effective -LRB- ads -RRB- and making them pay for the advertiser,'' <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> said. `` It's almost as good as the money.'' <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> takes pride in his company's innovation, citing numerous awards and patents. For instance, <ORGANIZATION> Structural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graphics </ORGANIZATION> launched the first musical print advertisement in December 1987 in People magazine. The two-page spread for Canadian Mist featured a winter scene and the Christmas carole, `` Deck The Halls.'' The business of producing a 3-D ad typically begins when an advertising agency contacts <ORGANIZATION> Structural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graphics </ORGANIZATION> with a proposal. Once presented with an idea, <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> unleashes a team of engineers and others who design a pop-up to fit the agency's requirements. Once the ad is accepted, it is printed outside Structural Graphics and then assembled, usually by hand, by about 300 people employed at a company plant in <LOCATION> Piedras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Negras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Some smaller volume ads also can be completed at the Structural Graphics plant in <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> or another in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The projects take 20 to 25 days to complete. Because of the work involved, 3-D ads are more expensive than ordinary print ads. As a result, companies interested in the ads are usually major companies seeking to promote themselves or new products, said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Thruelsen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Structrual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graphics </ORGANIZATION> marketing and sales director.

The musical ad was the first of its kind in the tobacco industry, where 300 styles compete for consumer dollars. `` We were looking for eye-stoppingness, and in this case, also ear-stoppingness,'' he said. <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> said advertisers like 3-D ads because they are extremely effective. Studies conducted by <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>'s companies and others have shown that as many as 90 percent of those who see a pop-up ad also read it, he said. A typical print ad has about a 30 percent readership `` if it's lucky,'' <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> believes the surface has barely been scratched for 3-D advertising. He said he's always coming up with new ideas and has yet to put most of them into production. `` It's being used, but not as much as the media blows it up,'' he said. `` Lots and lots of people are considering it.''

<HEAD>It's True: Success Produces Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many business consultants make a very good living analyzing corporate weaknesses and devising fix-up procedures that include new people, equipment and processes. Much time is involved. Lots of money. Repeated conferences too. Computer reports and graphs `` prove'' the erudition of the consultants. Indeed, if impressions were the measure of results these analyses would be invaluable. Contrast this complicated procedure with another approach, championed by a respected consultant, in which you focus on one problem or an aspect of one, attack it immediately with existing talent and produce immediate results. `` I've never seen a company in which it can not be done,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON>, who has written a remarkable book of common sense and canny insight, buttressed by more than 25 years of experience. While companies `` search far and wide for esoteric formulas to get them back in the running, some very powerful solutions lie close at hand,'' he says. <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, has demonstrated his theories in big companies and small, and now relates the story in `` The Breakthrough Strategy: Using Short-Term Success to Build The High Performance Organization.'' It confirms some widely held suspicions that management problems are n't as complicated as they might seem, that they seldom require the immediate purchase of new equipment, and that they can be solved today rather than tomorrow. Overly simplified, <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> preaches results-based management development, of which this is an example: In January 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters informed <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Quinn </PERSON>, manager of its <LOCATION> Calvert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> plant, that a corporate study to evaluate the facility's future was underway. The reason: Costs of its key chemical products were overly high and its market was eroding. After 37 years of operation, the future of the plant and the jobs of its 400 employees were on the line. Seventeen improvement teams, organized months before to tackle the plant's myriad problems, had failed to produce significant gains, partly because their efforts were too broad. Now they sought to focus on one critical element. The results showed up. In just eight weeks they were able to raise by 20 percent the feed rate of raw materials into one kiln among the many used to produce chemical reactions. Success! This first success changed the character of their turnaround efforts. Now they felt they could produce change. The team moved on to other kilns with productive results. Then they moved on to other projects, one at a time. Over the next six months the plant's managers were able to reduce overall production costs by 18 percent, focusing on one task at a time, benefiting from the enthusiasm and confidence generated by their successes. <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schaffer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, is a devout believer in the principle that problems refined to their elements can be simple to deal with, whereas problems taken as a whole can be impossibly difficult. His approach is to get results at once, utilizing the personnel and other resources already existing within a company. Why, he asks, does a crisis so often produce its own solution, where months of earlier effort had failed? Why? Because a crisis produces a real sense of urgency, a personal challenge to workers, a sense of shared commitment to a well-defined goal, a freedom to experiment with new ideas, and a feeling of imminent success. He calls them `` zest factors.'' While he does n't believe in creating artificial crises, he does think it important to recognize the lessons that crises produce. Zest factors can be used to mobilize effective action. In his book, produced by <ORGANIZATION> Ballinger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Harper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Row, he describes how initial successes become launching pads for a continuing process of improvement. He asserts that companies can build their basic capacity to compete in the long-term while _ in fact, because of _ obtaining a succession of small but immediate and tangible successes. Rarely, does a business consultant offer you simplicity of approach, low cost, immediate results and a procedure for a continuing, never ending series of improvements.

<HEAD>Grand Met Raises Offer for Pillsbury; Company Chairmen Meet</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 3 new grafs to UPDATE with Pillsbury rejecting
higher tender offer, editing to conform; picks up 3rd graf pvs,
Grand Met said...</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grand Metropolitan PLC of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> today increased its cash tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> common stock by $ 3 per share to $ 63, but <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> quickly rejected the proposal as it had a separate offer for a richer, negotiated deal. Late Sunday, Grand Met had said it would amend its tender offer in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The amended offer values <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s more than 86 million outstanding shares at about $ 5.42 billion. But <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors immediately rejected the $ 63-per-share offer as `` inadequate and not in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.'' Grand Met said Sunday it decided to raise its formal tender offer after Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> declined to endorse its offer to pay $ 65 a share for a friendly, negotiated acquisition. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> had said earlier Sunday night that Grand Met was willing to raise its offer to as much as $ 66 a share. Both companies issued statements saying that <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> met over the weekend with Grand Met Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> but did not reach an agreement. The jockeying occurred ahead of a hearing this afternoon in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chancery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s `` poison pill'' anti-takeover measures, the cornerstone of its defense against Grand Met. The British company's offer is conditioned on the removal of the pill. As of Friday night, stockholders had tendered 87.4 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> shares to Grand Met under its $ 60 bid. Grand Met, a major hotel and beverage conglomerate, has declined to buy any of the shares until the court rules on <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s defense. Court Chancellor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> has told participants that after oral arguments today, he will make a decision by the end of this week. At an initial meeting Friday evening, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> indicated he was prepared to increase Grand Met's offer to $ 63 a share. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> responded that he `` was not willing to discuss at this time'' a price which was not in the range of $ 68 to $ 73 a share, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s statement said. On Saturday morning, Grand Met indicated it was making a formal offer of $ 65 a share for a negotiated acquisition, according to both companies' statements. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> said its board of directors met Sunday but there was `` no enthusiasm'' for the $ 65-a-share proposal. At a meeting Sunday afternoon, <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> indicated that although $ 65 was his official final offer, $ 66 a share `` could be available,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s statement. According to Grand Met's statement, <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> said Friday night the British company was willing to pay $ 63 per share and `` perhaps a little more'' in a negotiated acquisition, but did n't specify how much more. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> said its board has authorized <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to be available for any discussions with Grand Met officials `` which are designed to maximize values to <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> shareholders.'' The fight to take over <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, a company that includes the Burger King fast-food chain as well as a variety of products bearing the <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> brand, has coincided with the even bigger takeover of food and tobacco giant <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>, which was bought in a leveraged buyout last week in a deal estimated to be worth about $ 25 billion.

<HEAD>Dollar Ends Higher In Europe, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose against major foreign currencies on Monday in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after spending most of the day fluctuating in a narrow range, and gold prices declined. Dealers said there was no particular reason for the dollar's strength on Monday Trading generally was trendless because most market participants were awaiting the release Wednesday of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for October, they said. The trade deficit was expected to be little changed in October from September's seasonally adjusted $ 10.4 billion. But a few dealers said they were more bearish, and were looking for a gap between $ 11 billion and $ 12 billion. One dealer said a smaller-than-expected deficit would boost the dollar to its next resistance level at 1.7750 West German marks, while a bearish figure would depress the dollar to the next big support level, which is 1.7150 marks. The dollar rose to 1.7410 marks on Monday from 1.7330 marks on Friday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.49 yen to close at closing 122.92 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 122.83 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.8418 from $ 1.8490 on Friday.

 Church's <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting a hostile takeover takeover bid from a rival restaurant chain, said Monday it was closing 120 unprofitable restaurants and taking writeoffs of up to $ 27 million. Church's is scrambling to fend off the hostile overtures from the parent of New Orleans-based Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and Biscuits, whose latest $ 8-per-share, $ 290 million offer expires Friday. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON>, Church's president and chief executive officer, said the restaurant closings in 20 states involved outlets that lost $ 7.4 million in the past 12 months. He said the losses from the restaurants were affecting the company's cash flow as it struggled with tough economic situations and the takeover attempt. There will be 24 closings in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; 12 in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>; 10 in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, nine in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, seven in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, six in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and three to four each in several other states. `` There was just too much chicken competition in those areas. We just overbuilt,'' <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON> said. `` We were taking big losses for a long time. These units were just a big drain. `` They should have been closed a year ago, but this is just part of my plan to make the company profitable again,'' he said. <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON> said the comapny would take write-offs of between $ 22 million and $ 27 million for its current fiscal year. Church's stock dipped 25 cents to $ 7.75 a share Monday in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. Church's, which has gone through several management changes and poor sales over the past two years, had 1,500 restaurants before the closures, second behind <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>. Church's expects sales this year of $ 520 million, down from $ 570 million in 1986 and $ 633 million in 1984. Popeyes, the nation's third-largest chicken chain with about 725 restaurants, expects to have sales of $ 485 million this year. Church's board of directors has rejected Popeyes' offer as inadequate and is challenging various aspects of it in federal court as well as seeking possible other suitors. A federal judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> earlier this month issued an order preventing Popeyes from buying Church's stock until 10 working days after Popeyes disclosed further information on its buyout offer. Popeyes' first takeover deadline was Nov. 30, but has been extended to Friday. Popeyes Chairman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> says he already owns 3.2 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s stock and says he has been tendered 14.6 million _ about 40.6 percent _ of <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s 35.9 million outstanding shares under the $ 8 a share offer.

 A late round of selling pushed stock prices lower Monday, wiping out a mild early bid to extend last week's rally. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up nearly 15 points at its midday peak, closed with a 3.91 loss at 2,139.58. The average rose 51.21 points last week. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 642 up, 770 down and 570 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 124.16 million shares, down from 133.77 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 150.08 million shares. Analysts said stocks drew some early benefit from a rise in the dollar against leading foreign currencies. But that upbeat theme seemed to be overridden by caution about prospects for <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> policy and the pending monthly report due out Wednesday on the nation's international trade balance. Brokers said it would be no surprise if <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policymakers, meeting Tuesday and Wednesday, decided to tighten credit conditions a bit further, especially if the news on trade is n't good. Advance estimates call for the October trade data to be about the same as September's, when imports exceeded exports by $ 9 billion, excluding freight and insurance costs. Takeover news and rumors provided the day's few instances of brisk activity. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> jumped 14 -RCB- to 98. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> partnership said it would offer $ 100 apiece for the <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> shares it does n't already own. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> climbed 3 ~ to 62 -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> raised its offer for the company's stock from $ 60 a share to $ 63 a share. And <ORGANIZATION> Alexanders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, discussed as a possible takeover candidate, rose 4 to 67. Among the blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> was up -LRB- at 46; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> gained -LRB- to 120 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 44 |; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> slipped \ to 29 \, and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was down -RRB- at American depositary receipts of Japanese stocks gave ground following a decline in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> dropped 2 to 155 \; <ORGANIZATION> Kyocera </ORGANIZATION> 1 -RCB- to 82 \, and <ORGANIZATION> Matsushita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> 3 -RRB- to Chemical Banking, which filed for an offering of 7 million common shares, fell 1 -LRB- to 31 -RCB-. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 4.91 billion, or 0.18 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks dropped .25 to 155.34. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index fell .63 to 318.43, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down .51 at 276.52 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market slumped 1.00 to 374.20.

<HEAD>Dollar Up In Light Trading, Gold Down</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The dollar strengthened marginally against major foreign currencies Monday but exchange dealers said trading was extremely slow, reflecting a reluctance to do business in advance of the government's market-moving monthly trade report. Gold prices eased. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 420.25 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $ 422.50 late Friday. Currency strategists read little significance into the dollar's small gain, saying it largely was due to internal market influences of supply and demand, not any outside news But some said speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would move to tighten interest rates may have strengthened the dollar a bit. Higher interest rates make dollar-denominated investments more attractive. Many dealers said the overwhelming force shaping the market's behavior was reticence to take any risky positions before the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report on the October trade deficit, due Wednesday The highly unpredictable monthly trade numbers are seen as one of the most visible symbols of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic strength and competitiveness abroad, with an enormous potential to influence financial markets. A large trade deficit would likely depress the dollar's value, while a small deficit would help stabilize or boost the currency. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose 0.49 yen to close at 122.92 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the dollar was quoted at 122.83 yen. By the time trading ended in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar fetched 122.80 yen, up from 122.49 yen late Friday. The British pound fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 1.8418 from $ 1.8490 on Friday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, sterling fetched $ 1.8435, down from $ 1.8495 late Friday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late rates on Friday, included: 1.7415 West German marks, up from 1.7352; 1.4643 Swiss francs, up from 1.4620; 1.1970 Canadian dollars, up from evels late Friday included: 1.7410 West German marks, up from 1.7330; 1.4650 Swiss francs, up from 1.4605; 5.9520 French francs, up from 5.9240; 1.9635 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9560; 1,282.75 Italian lire, up from 1,280.25; and 1.1983 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1970. In bullion trading, gold for current delivery fell $ 2.80 a troy ounce from late Friday's level to $ 420.10 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> elected two new directors as it and announced a reorganization of its management Monday in what was described as part of a long-term strategy to `` sell solutions, not machines.'' <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindelow </PERSON>, a senior vice president, will resign from the company at the end of the year in connection with the management shuffle. <PERSON> Lindelow </PERSON>'s responsibilities would have been reduced and he decided to look for another job, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON> said the reduction of <PERSON> Lindelow </PERSON>'s responsibilities was not a reflection of his abilities. The computer company also extended its stock repurchase plan and declared dividends at a board meeting Monday in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON>, was elected to the board of directors and promoted to executive vice president. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, currently chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Convergent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, also was elected to the board and will assume the position of executive vice president with the completion of the <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> acquisition of Convergent, a maker of small but speedy computer workstations. <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON> said the acquisition of Convergent allowed the company to reorganize its management and its engineering and manufacturing divisions. <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON> said the company's long-term strategy focuses on three areas: small computers, such as the Convergent machines; large, traditional mainframe computers; and networking, which is the process of allowing different computer systems to communicate with each other. `` It's part of our overall strategy, which is selling solutions, not machines,'' he said. `` We believe the customer does not care about the machine as much as the customer cares about what the machine will do for him,'' <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON> said. Under the new management, <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> will be responsible for implementing the company's financial and strategic plans. <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> will become president of a newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Also under the new management, the current president of Convergent, <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yansouni </PERSON>, will be a <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> corporate vice president. A current <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president and director, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Unruh </PERSON>, will be responsible for all commercial marketing operations. He currently is in charge of international marketing operations and the implementation of the annual financial plan. A <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president, <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caswell </PERSON>, will become president of a newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, responsible for marketing the mainframe systems and peripheral products. The reorganization is expected to be implemented during the first quarter of 1989, after Convergent shareholders vote on the acquisition Dec. 22. In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, the board declared a quarterly dividend of 25 cents per common share and a 93.75 cent dividend on the company's Series A cumulative convertible preferred stock. The board also extended for one year its periodic repurchase of the company's common and preferred stock, which was implemented last year. During 1988, the company purchased nearly 2 million of its authorized 10 million shares and reissued about half to fund stock option and other employee benefit plans. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> is a $ 10 billion manufacturer of commercial information systems, defense systems and related services. It has more than 90,000 employees and 60,000 customers in more than 100 countries.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Plunge On Supplies Buildup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices fell steeply Monday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after the exchange reported the first increase in nearly a month in deliverable supplies of the metal. On other markets, precious metals mostly were lower; livestock and meat futures moved sharply higher; energy futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were mixed; and stock-index futures fell. Copper settled 1 cent to 4.40 cents lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with the spot contract for delivery in December at $ 1.585 a pound and the more actively traded March contract at $ 1.352 a pound. Daily increases in the amount of warehoused copper registered with the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> have been rare since October 1987, when the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> copper inventory stood at nearly 90,000 short tons. Late last week, the exchange reported that warehouse stocks had dropped to 5,204 tons and copper for December delivery on the exchange soared to an all-time high of $ 1.6475 a pound. But copper traders who had expected the trend to continue were shocked Monday morning when the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> reported that warehouse stocks had risen to 6,545 tons, a 24 percent increase from last week's tally `` That was an unpleasant surprise to the market,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Comex last reported an increase in copper stocks on Nov. 17. Meanwhile, the world's other major copper futures market, the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, reported a 1,925-ton decline in its warehouse stocks of copper, which was a smaller decrease than traders had expected, <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> said. Platinum futures prices fell sharply in a technically inspired sell-off, dragging a gold prices lower as well, but silver futures were mixed, analysts said. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, platinum settled $ 8.60 to $ 11.10 lower with January at $ 589.10 a troy ounce. On the Comex, gold settled $ 2.80 to $ 3.10 lower with February at $ 424.60 a troy ounce; silver was 0.7 cent lower to 0.4 cent higher with March at $ 6.298 a troy ounce. Pork futures rose strongly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on speculation that last week's drop in slaughters meant hog kills had passed their seasonal peak, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Durchholz </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Agri-Visor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Strong retail demand and the arrival of wintry conditions in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> also contributed to the advance in pork futures, he said `` Farmers just havent' been willing to move hogs with the kind of temperatures we've had because it stresses them a little more,'' <PERSON> Durchholz </PERSON> said. Cattle futures rallied in sympathy with the pork complex and in reaction to renewed demand, he said. Live cattle settled .25 cent to .60 cent higher with December at 72.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to 1 cent higher with January at 83.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .63 cent to 1.20 cents higher with December at 42.77 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.03 cent to 1.35 cent higher with February at 44.60 cents a pound. Home heating oil prices closed sharply higher and lent support to crude oil futures after sub-zero temperatures hit the Northeast, analysts said. Gasoline futures retreated. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents 22 cents higher with January at $ 16.06 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent to .70 cent higher with January at 50.20 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .11 cent to .40 cent lower with January at 44.20 cents a gallon. Grain futures finished higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid rumors of impending grain sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> while soybean prices settled mostly lower in response to weekend rains in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a monthly grain supply-demand report after the close in which it increased its estimate for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stockpile at the end of the current marketing year to 533 million bushels from 528 million bushels. Wheat settled 1 -LCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 4.28 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 4 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.61 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -RCB- cents to 5 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.07 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 4 \ cents lower to 4 -RCB- cents higher with January at $ 7.69 \ a Stock index futures fell moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 settled 1.15 points lower at 279.30. Each point is worth $ 500.

<TEXT>
 The Disney-held company seeking to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> amended its takeover offer Monday to meet a federal court order that was blocking the bid. <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its hostile $ 42-a-share bid for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> was now contingent on whether a judge in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> invalidated or rescinded the <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> employee stock ownership plan being challenged by <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>. Analysts said the move would not dramatically alter <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s $ 2.6 billion tender offer, which has been in abeyance pending court action In <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Caleb </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on Monday ordered <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> to modify the language of the offer and issue a news release on the changes. The <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, Calif.-based television concern, wholly owned by the <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> family, met the conditions immediately. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> said it would purchase <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> shares under its $ 42 offer only if the employee stock plan was invalidated by <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> is challenging the plan. Previously, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> had maintained that the deal could have proceeded merely if the 10 million shares in the stock plan were ruled not part of the company's outstanding shares. If the $ 300 million plan is invalidated, <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> would try to buy 62 million outstanding shares. If not, it would be faced with acquiring about 72 million shares under an earlier $ 40-a-share offer, analysts said. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> owns 5 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said the company had no comment on the development. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> last month ordered the district court to issue a preliminary injunction blocking the takeover bid until <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> clarified its position on the employee stock plan. The plan places 14 percent of the company stock in employee hands, a move <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> claims was designed intentionally to defend against its hostile takeover bid. Under <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law, a hostile bidder must acquire at least 85 percent of a company. Cambridge-based Polaroid, which introduced instant snapshots in 1948, is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think this implies a change in the approach of <LOCATION> Shamrock </LOCATION> to the offer or really any material change in the offer,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Arguments in the chancery court case are scheduled for Friday. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> said it would extend its offer for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> past next Monday's expiration date to wait for a court ruling.

 <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese investment giant, has acquired a 20 percent stake in a holding partnership formed by The <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a rapidly-growing investment banking firm, the two concerns said Monday The deal formalizes a business relationship that began when <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> invested $ 100 million in a <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> buyout fund last year. It gives <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> an infusion of capital and better access to the Japanese capital markets. It is the latest in a series of alliances that has seen Japanese investment firms buy stakes in the relatively smaller Wall Street investment boutiques that are becoming an increasingly potent force in the mergers and acquisitions arena. Last summer, <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> bought a 20 percent stake in the buyout firm <ORGANIZATION> Wasserstein </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perella </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Yamaichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy a 25 percent equity interest in another small buyout firm, <ORGANIZATION> Lodestar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Tokyo-based <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> said it would pay $ 100 million for the interest in the <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> holding partnership.

<HEAD>Group of Eight Meet to Discuss Latin American Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Economic and finance ministers from seven <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations agreed Monday to take `` urgent'', collective measures to reduce their foreign debt. The so-called Group of Eight also agreed in a closed-door meeting to present the measures, which were undisclosed, to their respective presidents. The group is composed of ministers from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> dropped out of the group last year due to internal political turmoil. Together, the eight member countries owe around $ 400 billion in foreign debt along with $ 25 billion in interest due in 1989. The measures should be accompanied by a call for cut in interst rates below the market rate, according to Brazilian Finance Minister <PERSON> Mailson </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON>. In the six years since the world debt crisis erupted, this is the first time that debtor nations have proposed an apparently unconventional, collective answer to the debt question, some observers said. At past meetings some members have stressed that each country's particular characteristics make a case-by-case direct resolution of their respective debts with creditors the more appropriate path to follow. During the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> meeting, as in past years, the Group of Eight avoided talk of a debt cartel.

<HEAD>Chevron Announces $100 Million Loss on Irving Oil Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday it will post a loss in excess of $ 100 million after taxes in the fourth quarter on the sale of its 48.9 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. But a spokesman for the oil giant said the charge should not result in a net loss for the quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> said it sold its interest in <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> on Friday after having an interest in the firm for more than 30 years, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McLennan </PERSON>, manager of investor relations for <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> would not disclose the details of the transaction. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Oil </PERSON> is a privately-held company based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, that operates a refinery and has a number of marketing outlets. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> officials denied that the sale, which had been negotiated `` for some time,'' was prompted by anything in particular. `` It's been a profitable enterprise for us,'' he said. `` The charge we're taking in the fourth quarter is, in a sense, undoing a little bit of the profits of the past. Overall, it's been a profitable investment.'' <PERSON> McLennan </PERSON> said it `` was in neither one of our interests'' to continue the minority interest. The two companies have some `` very, very small'' joint operations that will continue under contract, he added. `` Although it is a substantial loss to take, it should not put us in the red for the quarter,'' said <PERSON> McLennan </PERSON>. `` It should n't really even come close.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> had net income of $ 220 million, or 64 cents a share, in the foureth quarter a year ago after taking a charge of $ 93 million related to the disposition and write-off of assets. In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> rose 12 -LCB- cents a share to $ 46 on Monday.

<HEAD>Lucas Sues over `Templates of Doom'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The maker of the film `` <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jones </LOCATION> and the Temple of Doom'' has brought a copyright infringement suit against a computer software company for its `` Templates of Doom'' product. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> suit by <ORGANIZATION> Lucasfilm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, filed last Friday, claims the program, marketed by Solar Systems Software, violates filmmaker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' copyright in his <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> films and spinoff products. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoniak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bruno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, identified in the suit as owner of Solar Systems Software, did not return a telephone call Monday. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an archeologist and adventurer played by <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, was the central character in <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' `` Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and `` <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the Temple of Doom.'' A third film, `` <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the Last Crusade,'' is due in May 1989, the suit said. It said <ORGANIZATION> Lucasfilm </ORGANIZATION> has trademarked the `` Temple of Doom'' name and design and used it to sell products that include puzzles, books, comics, video games, lapel buttons, kites, slumberbags, T-shirts and children's pajamas. The `` Templates of Doom'' program is sold in a package that pictures a character resembling <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, wearing a snap-brim fedora, leather jacket and shoulder bag, the suit said. The program is used to teach people how to use financial spreadsheet programs, said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Lucasfilm </ORGANIZATION>. The suit seeks $ 50,000 for each copyright infringement, plus damages equal to three times the profits from the product, and a court order prohibiting future infringements. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Lucasfilm </ORGANIZATION> has asked Antoniak several times over a period of months to stop his marketing, without success. `` This is not a lawsuit we wanted to bring,'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said. `` But one can not let one's trademark be used freely by others over a period of time or one eventually loses the trademark.''
