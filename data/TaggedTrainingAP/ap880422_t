 Two explosions ripped through a riverside grain elevator complex Friday, killing at least two people, injuring three others and leveling four grain silos and an office building, authorities said. Three more people were reported missing at the <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growmark </ORGANIZATION> complex, along the <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> about 40 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Behringer </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Will </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Officials on the scene confirmed that two people died and at least three others were injured, Ms. <PERSON> Behringer </PERSON> added. `` It shook this building like a truck or something had hit the back of this building,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderlinden </PERSON>, a worker at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Stonitsch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It was quite a big explosion.'' Authorities suspect grain dust may have caused the first explosion about 11 a.m., which ruptured a natural gas main and touched off a second blast moments later, said Fire Chief <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Plese </PERSON>. Granaries pose an explosion risk because of highly flammable grain dust. The explosions leveled the complex's 100-feet tall concrete silos, which hold a total of about 100,000 bushels, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Burket </PERSON>, a spokesman for the granary. Initial reports said six silos were destroyed, but <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Munchalfen </PERSON>, a security guard at the facility, said there had been four silos at the site, and only a sheet-metal covered grain dryer remained standing. One silo crushed the adjacent one-story office building. `` It's gone, totaled, level complete _ just like dynamite,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON>, 64, a <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> farmer who said he saw metal and concrete flying through the air after the blast. `` I ran about 30 feet when I fell and rolled. It just came down in a big pile,'' said <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON>, who witnessed the blast while he was leaving the complex after unloading a truckload of grain. Rescue workers used dogs, bulldozers and a crane to search for two people believed missing in a 25-foot-high pile of concrete chunks and twisted steel mixed with corn and soybeans, authorities said. Disaster officials also sent four boats to search the river after a witness reported seeing a third person fall off a barge nearby, Ms. <PERSON> Behringer </PERSON> said. The explosion shattered windows in homes east of the elevator complex and sprayed grain and rubble, burying a tractor-trailer rig. The <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growmark </ORGANIZATION> elevator is a joint venture between Decatur-based <ORGANIZATION> Archer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daniels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and Bloomington-based <ORGANIZATION> Growmark </ORGANIZATION>, a regional cooperative that sells farm supplies and markets grain. <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Burket </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> said the complex receives grain hauled by truck and transfers it to river barges. The <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> accident brought to five the number of people killed in elevator explosions so far this year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Department statistics show 222 workers were killed and 839 were injured in 489 grain-dust explosions from 1958 through 1985. Data for the last two years was not immediately available. Authorities identified the dead as <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Slatton </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, 20, of Anchor. Both worked at the elevator, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> part-time while he studied agriculture at <ORGANIZATION> Joliet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. One person was in fair condition at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and another was treated and released, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oudt </PERSON>. A third person was treated at <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cross </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and released, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 There once was a time when people could sit in the bar of the old Hotel <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON> and enjoy looking at <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>'s mural, `` Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>.'' The once elegant hotel is now an earthquake-damaged hulk waiting to be demolished, and the mural is in its own museum pavilion across the street. The delicate transfer of the mural has been completed. It escaped damage in the Sept. 19, 1985, earthquake that killed thousands and devastated large parts of the city. The famous mural is open to the public again, like a window opened on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s rich history. It shows figures from the Mexican political and art worlds and from daily life all on parade in the park. An explanation at the entrance to the new museum says the decision was made to transfer the mural from the hotel after the extent of the damage there became clear. `` It should be linked to the <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, for having been painted on that theme and for the place itself,'' the plaque from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> says. The <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, the downtown park across the street and down a block from the mural's old home, also was expanded through earthquake reconstruction programs. A `` Solidarity Garden'' recalling the victims of the 1985 disaster was built on the site of the cleared, adjoining block that once held a department store and the Hotel Regis. The mural's pavilion is built on the site of the hotel's parking garage, which was badly damaged and demolished after the quake. The <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said that no room could be found in any of its buildings close to the <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, `` because of the colossal dimensions of the work. ... That's why it was decided to take advantage of the possibility of constructing an appropriate building.'' In place of the old hotel's comfortable cocktail lounge, viewers now can sit on three simple benches placed in front of the mural or just stand for a while in the large but sparsely decorated room. Diagrams, with keyed numbers on the outline of each figure, tell who 73 of the people shown in the mural are. Among the figures is a fat boy with large eyes and a round face, a self-portrait _ something <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> often put in his works. In the foreground is Spanish conqueror <PERSON> Hernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortes </PERSON>. On a park bench an elderly man dreams of President <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>, giving American Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> the keys to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and other lands that once belonged to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Farther back, a former military man, now poor, dreams of the emperors <PERSON> Maximilian </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Carlota </LOCATION>. A drunken tramp, next to an old woman, dreams with his mouth open of miltiary glories, at the side of <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON>, who holds the reform laws he put into effect as <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s great 19th century president. Near the center is dictator <PERSON> Porfirio </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON>. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> appears full of his fame and power, with a chest full of ribbons on his uniform. At the right, a street vendor offers typical Mexican food to a middle-class youth and three students, who dream of Gen. <PERSON> Victoriano </PERSON> <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON>. Official history says <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON> had <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madero </PERSON>, who started the 1910-21 Mexican revolution, killed. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> completed the 49 -LCB- foot by 13 foot painting for the then fashionable <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON> in 1948. Along with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Siqueiros </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON> <PERSON> Orozco </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> was one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s three great muralists and one of the most important Latin American painters in the art world. He died in 1957. Among his other best known murals are those in the National Palace of the Spanish conquest, the Mexican revolution and other events from the country's history. `` The composition is memories of my life, of my childhood and my youth, from 1895 to 1910,'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> wrote after finishing the mural. `` I do not believe that this work has alarmed or can alarm anyone. The contemporary figures in the fresco, as figures in dreams, are not portraits.'' It was an apparent reference to the phrase, `` God Does Not Exist,'' a quote attributed to Juarez adviser <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> and written on a piece of paper by <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> in the mural. Eight years after the mural was completed, <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> changed the paper to read, `` Conference in the Academy of <LOCATION> Letran </LOCATION>, the year 1836.'' The phrase refers to the date and place where <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> made his controversial comment.

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' first step towards universal health care insurance may be a first step towards a national health care plan, says Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` What we do here today can and must be done all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the Democratic presidential front-runner said Thursday, signing the nation's first law to make health insurance available to all Bay Staters by 1992. `` We have made a great start,'' he told about 2,000 supporters crowded onto the Statehouse steps for the signing ceremony. `` Now we must make it work. And then we must carry the message of health care for all across all this country.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said universal health care was under discussion in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> for nearly two years before it passed the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, it has been 40 years since <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> proposed it for the nation. `` As an American, I do n't want my country to stand alone with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as the only two industrialized nations that do not provide basic health security for their citizens,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supports a bill by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., calling for minimum health care guarantees `` as the first step towards providing health insurance to all Americans,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Akey </PERSON> The governor also supports states taking their own initiative to offer universal health care, <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> press </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> bill was the outcome of a nine-month legislative struggle and comes two years after <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> voters voted 2-1 for a non-binding referendum urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact a national health care program. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Himmelstein </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman for Physicians for a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, called the health care bill a first step but `` a Band-Aid approach when major surgery is needed.'' On Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> estimated that the law's cost to taxpayers would be $ 645.2 million through fiscal 1992, less about $ 22.5 million in projected cost-cutting in Medicaid. Other estimates put the cost to the state government in the next four years as high as $ 1.2 billion. The law would provide coverage to about 600,000 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> residents under age 65 currently without health insurance, or roughly one of every 10 people in the commonwealth. This would be done in stages and through a variety of approaches, from extending Medicaid benefits for disabled adults and children to state-brokered, pooled insurance for small businesses and individuals. By 1992, all employers with more than five full-time employees must offer health insurance coverage or pay an unemployment surcharge to help the state provide this coverage to the uninsured. Under the proposal, the state also would take control of a $ 300 million-a-year pool for indigents that is funded from hospital surcharges on the insured. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, who proposed the idea of universal health care in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> more than a year ago, acknowledged that risks were involved in the undertaking. `` In the end I think we regret what we have never done _ not what we've tried and we've failed but what we've never tried,'' she said. `` This whole effort is about the ability to take a risk.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> hijack has spawned plenty of proposals from governments, anti-terrorism experts and the public on how to tackle air piracy, but each idea invariably contains a serious pitfall. They range from a West German lawmaker's suggestion that knockout gas be pumped into hijacked planes, to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s call for an international brigade to fight terrorism. The hijack drama, which ended in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> on Wednesday, left a bittersweet taste around <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where it unfolded daily through live TV broadcasts. The anguish and frustration it engendered was reflected in calls to radio talkshows and letters to newspapers proposing various anti-hijack strategies. There was rejoicing that the ordeal ended peacefully and that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> apparently stood firm against demands for the release of 17 jailed pro-Iranian terrorists. Experts noted that hijackings have fallen from 95 in 1969 to fewer than 20 a year in the 1980s. They also pointed to the difficulty the hijackers had in landing the Kuwaiti jumbo jet, saying it showed that the refusal of airports to deal with air pirates is almost universal. But there was outrage that the nine hijackers, having killed two passengers and put others through a horrifying ordeal, apparently escaped unpunished. `` At the risk of sounding churlish, the ending of one of the longest hijackings in aviation history is not an occasion for unrestrained rejoicing,'' commented The Independent, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper. Experts say the biggest problem is airport security. Some airports are extremely strict, such as in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> where departing passengers are interrogated, while others are dangerously lax. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>, security chief at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, likens security to `` a great spider web over the whole world, and there's no way of plugging up every single gap. The chain of security is only as strong as its weakest link.'' Authorities in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, where the airliner was parked before the hijacking, say guns could have been smuggled aboard before the plane reached <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. But they are investigating suspicions that Thai catering staff were bribed into helping the hijackers. `` Ground staff are very poorly paid in Third World countries,'' says <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON> of the Institute for the Study of Terrorism. `` And if people there can be bribed, hijackers are going to go for Third World countries.'' One measure proposed by <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> institute is to store passengers' passports in the baggage hold, thus making it difficult for hijackers to identify hostages for execution by nationality. The Israeli newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> reported that a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> rabbi was in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> selling a hijack survival kit containing a false passport, ID and credit card to Israelis who have good reason to conceal their identities from hijackers. Maariv said the kit costs a hefty $ 165. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Clutterbuck </PERSON>, an English anti-terrorism expert, proposes issuing a fingerprinted clearance card entitling bona fide passengers to clear airports speedily, while those with no card would be searched. But <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON> says the system wo n't work, because states that sponsor terrorism will have little trouble obtaining the clearance cards. West German lawmaker <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerster </PERSON> suggests a gas to `` put the hijackers and the passengers to sleep lightning-quick.'' The danger, some experts say, is that if the gas failed to work instantly, it would leave the hijackers enough time to detonate explosives. <PERSON> Clutterbuck </PERSON> says sophisticated machinery is being developed to detect explosives thermally or by neutron bombardment. But the problem, he acknowledged in an interview, is that it is expensive. The Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, representing 168 airlines in 114 countries, proposes new international courts to try hijackers and an international commando brigade. But <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON> called this `` a utopian dream,'' saying in an interview: `` It's difficult enough to get collaboration even with firmest allies. In a lot of countries the different intelligence agencies do n't even cooperate among themselves.'' <ORGANIZATION> IATA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyd </PERSON> recalled the 1978 summit at which the seven leading industrial democracies threatened sanctions against countries that fail to bring hijackers to justice. The threat has only once been implemented, against <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, he told <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio, adding: `` One wonders why it has n't been applied more often.'' <PERSON> Clutterbuck </PERSON> said: `` In a perfect world it would of course have been far better if the hijackers had n't been released. But I think that would have been too much to expect.'' But <PERSON> Kyd </PERSON> said that by releasing the hijackers, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> had set itself up as `` a soft touch'' for terrorists. He said hijackers should be punished, `` whatever that takes. If it means prolonging the suffering of other hostages aboard an aircraft, then so be it.''

<HEAD>Ban On Nuclear-Armed Warships Raises NATO Frustration With Denmark</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s move to bolster its ban on visiting nuclear-armed warships has focused attention on a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ally that already suffers from a reputation as an unreliable comrade-in-arms. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> long has complained that <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> does not pull its weight in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Its annual defense spending _ 2.2 percent of its gross national product in 1987 _ is the lowest of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s European members except for <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. For 31 years, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> has had a general policy banning nuclear arms from its soil in peacetime. Until now, Danish officials took the position of assuming that visiting warships would obey. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> voted to demand that warships be told they can not carry nuclear arms into Danish ports. At <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters here, officials say the measure, if implemented, would render <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s reinforcement strategy for <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> useless. The measure led Danish Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s minority government to call for early elections May 10. The center-right government opposes the nuclear-armed warship measure and maintains <PERSON> Danes </PERSON> remain loyal to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. One Danish <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official said that in a marriage, `` it behooves either partner not to be confrontational.'' `` We should not exaggerate the situation but accept there are differences of opinion within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Such comments do little to calm the nerves of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials whose primary concern is to maintain an iron-clad consensus about defense, notably nuclear arms. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> both prohibit the stationing of nuclear arms on their soil during peacetime. But neither requires visiting <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> warships to declare whether they are carrying such arms. In 1984, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> broke off military cooperation with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> after that country began insisting that warships say whether or not they carry nuclear weapons. `` We know that in some cases allied warships carried nuclear arms into our ports,'' said the Danish official. `` This, of course, was not allowed but we closed one eye,'' said the Danish official. To tell visiting warships they can not carry nuclear arms into Danish ports would, said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>, `` run counter to the basis of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy and the principles of shared burdens and benefits'' of alliance membership. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which would rush to <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s aid in times of crisis with troops and materiel, have a policy of never saying whether their warships have nuclear arms. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official said this week that the stricter anti-nuclear stand, if taken to its logical conclusion, would mean <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies can not reinforce <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> during a crisis before the outbreak of war. Failure to reinforce <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s choke-point on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s Baltic fleet would affect not just <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> but also neighboring <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` It's clear this is not a Danish-American or Danish-British problem, but a matter for all of the alliance,'' said a senior West German <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> source, also speaking privately. The controversy led <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to move next week's <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers meeting from <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. The meeting will focus on nuclear defense issues. In 1985, <PERSON> Mchael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hesseltine </PERSON>, then <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, warned <LOCATION> Danes </LOCATION> not to expect British soldiers to come to their aid if they do n't do more for their own defense. Last March, Danish Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorsen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s top commander for the <ORGANIZATION> Baltic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Approaches </ORGANIZATION>, resigned and said he could no longer `` represent <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> in a reasonable manner.'' He said Danish defense was being `` maltreated'' through gross underfinancing.

<HEAD>Producers Claim Writers Strike Causing $15 Million In Losses So

<TEXT>
 The Hollywood scriptwriters' strike has cost their industry more than $ 15 million, producers say, blaming much of the loss to production halts on such hit series as `` The Cosby Show'' and `` <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION>. Law.'' Directors, actors, production crew workers and secretaries were among thos hit by the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> strike, <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. He said about 1,400 employees who work in production areas other than writing have been laid off as a result of the seven-week-old strike. The 9,000-member guild went on strike March 7 over issues of residuals from movies and television shows distributed in foreign countries and a producers' proposal to restructure residual payments for hourlong television shows sold into syndication. `` We have no way of verifying the information they put out,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>. `` However, we do question whether they have taken into consideration the normal seasonal layoffs that have occurred because of -LRB- the television season -RRB- hiatus.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said the layoffs and costs tabulated by the producers were chiefly from 22 regular season television episodes from shows such as `` L.A. Law'' and `` The Cosby Show,'' which were not produced because of lack of scripts. `` This has nothing whatsoever to do with the seasonal layoffs,'' said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. `` It has nothing to do with the hiatus.'' Two federally mediated sessions on April 18 and March 14 ended without resumption of negotiations. No new talks are scheduled. The strike curtailed the seasons of several television shows and could threaten the start of the fall television season if it continues into the summer. According to statistics gathered by the alliance, a bargaining organization of more than 200 studios and producers, the strike thus far has cost 1,062 cast and crew members an estimated $ 12.7 million in salaries and benefits. Some 210 secretaries and other officer staffers have been laid off as a result of the strike, and lost an estimated $ 756,000 in salaries. The strike also has affected 207 so-called `` writer hyphenates,'' who have lost fees, salaries and benefits worth an estimated $ 2.2 million. A writer hyphenate is generally a writer-producer, someone who is developing a television show or movie. Because they are on strike as writers, they can not advance work on scripts or ideas. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said the alliance's analysis concludes that 45,000 person-days have been lost as a result of the strike. `` If the Alliance wants to see a speedy end to the strike the best way to assure that would be to return to the table and continue a dialogue that can resolve the outstanding issues,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said the last 20-minute meeting between the new sides had been requested by the writers, but the union had no new offers.

<TEXT>
 Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is getting loads of advice on where to turn for a running mate, with many party leaders urging him to avoid <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and turn to a Southern senator. But the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor indicated Thursday he wants maximum breathing room as he searches for someone to fill the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket. `` Obviously you look at regions where you could use some help,'' said former Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` The South and West are the regions. You also look at a philosophical segment where you could use some shoring up and I guess that would be with moderate conservative voters.'' <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, who had urged Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to run for president, said he would like to see <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> as the vice presidential candidate, but only if the senator were offered the opportunity to serve as secretary of defense at the same time. Party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> predicted that the vice presidential nominee would be `` a senator from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> or Southwest.'' `` I would n't make that judgment at all,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He also rejected suggestions that if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> finishes second in the race for the presidential nomination, he ought to be given the No. 2 spot on the ticket. `` If I were to finish second, it would n't entitle me to anything more than consideration, period,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The discussion of potential <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> running mates began to intensify after the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's strong victory in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary established him as the likely Democratic presidential nominee. `` I have spent literally zero time thinking about it. And I will not, unless and until I have either won the nomination, or it looks as if it's pretty well in hand,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> insisted. `` If that happens, then I will begin what I hope will be a thoughtful and thorough process of selecting a running mate. But I'm not going to do anything on that _ quite literally _ until the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> primaries are over.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the paramount concern in choosing a running mate ought to be a candidate's ability to serve as a `` first-rate president if, God forbid, something happened to the president.'' `` All else pales by comparison,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, who has been faulted in the campaign for his lack of experience in foreign affairs, disputed the view that he needs to select a running mate with experience in international issues. `` You pick a secretary of state to be your key foreign policy adviser, and a national security adviser and secretary of defense,'' he said, adding that `` you do n't necessarily need another secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>'' as vice president. There were mixed opinions on the value of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as a running mate. <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` does n't fill in the kind of strengths he -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- needs.'' `` Both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the ticket together is not the best political decision you can make,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, campaign manager for <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> when he was the Democratic presidential nominee in 1984. `` I think everybody fully expects to see a Southerner this time,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapierre </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the ticket would hurt <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> because there still are many people who will not accept a black. `` The sad part is, not voting for him because of disagreement on issues or lack of experience in government, that's OK, that's what politics is all about. The race thing, you hate to say it, but it's there. At a news conference Wednesday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` I need his -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- support base to win. He needs my support base to win. Together we can win.'' Asked if he were talking about a Dukakis-Jackson ticket, the candidate said, `` No. It's just the challenge we have to pull together our constituencies.'' `` He's not running for vice president and I did n't sign on with him for vice president,'' <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the national chairman of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign and the speaker of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Assembly </LOCATION>, said Thursday. But, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, `` I think a Dukakis-Jackson -LRB- ticket -RRB- would be good. I think a Jackson-Dukakis would be the best for the Democrats.'' `` I think <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has worked hard and perhaps earned it if he wants it,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member from <LOCATION> Coffeyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> `` It does n't bother me if a black is on the ticket,'' he added. `` People want to win.''

 What do <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> have in common? Both wear a glove for no apparent reason. That's one of the jokes making the rounds about the winless team that's also known as the Zer-O's. Fans of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> are laughing on the outside, but crying on the inside as they watch their team soar _ like a stone. `` They need to get psychotherapy,'' banker <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Swensen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> said Thursday. `` I'm not going to watch the games until they start winning. I ca n't handle it. I get nauseous.'' Wednesday's loss to the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewers </ORGANIZATION> gave the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> the dubious distinction of being the first major league team in history to lose 14 games at the start of the season. They continued their losing ways Thursday, falling 7-1 to the <ORGANIZATION> Brewers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. But fans in <LOCATION> Birdland </LOCATION> say it will take more than a string of losses to kill the pride they have in the team that won the World Series five years ago and six pennants from 1966 to 1983. `` I think they're the best,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Slowinski </PERSON>, 28, a sales representative for a beer company. `` People around here are Bird fanatics. It's embarrassing, because there is a winning tradition here in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. I have season tickets. I go to the games expecting them to win.'' Disc jockey <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, who vowed to stay on the air at WIYY-FM until the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> break the skid, was a trifle grouchy Thursday after broadcasting for more than 58 hours. He has napped briefly between music sets since Tuesday. `` I'm a little irritable. I'm a little cranky. ... I can see the bags under my eyes,'' he said. `` But I'm holding up my commitment.'' <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON>, an administrative assistant in the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>' public relations office, said the telephones have been ringing off the hook as fans called to offer encouragement and suggestions. `` One lady wanted to hold a mass positive thinking seminar for the fans and the club,'' Ms. Waters said. `` One lady recommended hypnosis. She said if she hypnotized all of them, and let them know how good they are,'' the streak would end. `` We have a group of letters from a local school. I do n't know if the teacher was making fun of us, but the kids' letters suggested -LRB- the players -RRB- chew gum and stick it on the end of their bats to help make contact, or put it in their gloves so they might catch a ball,'' Ms. Waters said. A regular caller to her office this week has been <PERSON> Baltimore </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> man who changed his name to reflect his affection for the city. `` He's calling to say hi. He's apparently taking a lot of ribbing from friends who support the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>,'' Ms. Waters said. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Litty </PERSON>, 42, a lifelong fan and member of the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> Advocates, a baseball promotion and volunteer civic organization in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, figures the odds are with the team at this point. `` Besides the fact that they're playing bad, they're snakebit,'' <PERSON> Litty </PERSON> said. `` As each game progresses, the more these guys are putting pressure upon themselves. Once they get this victory _ and I know they will get it _ maybe things will straighten out and they will become a competitive team. `` I ca n't understand it. I know this is a better ballclub than what we're showing. We've had a long history of being a successful ballclub. I'm just dealing with it day to day and hoping they break out of it.''

 Democrat <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> made his exit from the 1988 presidential race with this succinct analysis of his debt-burdened bid: `` I was doing great until I turned 40.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s departure Thursday narrowed the Democratic presidential race down to two _ front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. It was forced by <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s failure to score a breakthrough in any state of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, ending with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator ran much of his campaign burdened by the notion that at age 39 he was too young, and expressed relief upon turning 40 at the end of March. But by then the high point of his campaign had come and gone _ the Super Tuesday contests six weeks ago when he won five Southern primaries. He never fared better than a 17 percent showing in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> after that. `` Things did n't work out exactly the way I had planned,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, flanked by his wife, parents and children, told supporters jammed into a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> office building. `` I lost this race, and that is a disappointment,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` But some things matter to me more than winning _ helping my party, serving my country, knowing when to keep fighting and knowing when I've been licked.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> technically left his campaign in a suspended state. While acknowledging he would n't be the nominee or campaign any more, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> maintains a candidacy that permits all his delegates to attend the Democratic National Convention. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> amassed 423 Democratic National Convention delegates during his campaign, according to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count. Under party rules, delegate slots he has already won but for which people have not yet been chosen could have been awarded to other candidates, had he not remained technically a candidate. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would have gained 34 of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s delegates immediately, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would have gotten 29. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s decision to suspend his campaign denied <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> another 47 delegates he would have inherited in this manner <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said he spoke with both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and that both were `` comfortable'' with his decision to hold onto the delegates since neither would have gained significantly. He said the move would protect <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders who backed him in states where delegates had not yet been chosen, naming <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> as an example. He said he planned no endorsement and repeated his oft-stated contention that he has `` no interest'' in the vice presidential nomination, though he left that door open. `` I'm not trying in any way to broker a convention that is not going to be brokered anyway,'' he said. In departing, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> delivered some of the most eloquent lines of his campaign. He offered praise for his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> opponents during the long campaign, saying that each had taught him something. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, he said, taught him that `` a successful president must be both a chief executive and a preacher.'' It was a line that recalled the criticism he leveled at <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> two weeks ago, when <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said the nation was choosing a president not a preacher. He excoriated President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying they had brought `` the most selfish generation of leadership'' in American history. `` We have been subjected for eight years to a man who quotes our heroes against us,'' he said. `` But <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> does not belong to a man who does not even see the homeless on our streets.'' He promised support for the eventual Democratic nominee. `` I want no part of a stop-Jackson or a stop-Dukakis movement,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` The only man I want to stop is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.''

 For awhile, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavalla </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Morelli </PERSON> thought about what they could do with their $ 13,615 refund check from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Unhappily, they decided to send it back. `` When it's that big you send it back, because you know they'll hunt this down,'' <PERSON> Lavalla </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> `` It's a very, very tempting thing, when you look at five digits, with your name on the check.'' However she added, `` I need a couple more zeroes to hide all that guilt.'' Their check for $ 13,615, more than 25 times the approximately $ 500 refund they expected, was nearly half of the couple's combined yearly income. `` ` Whattaya mean we're going to send it back?''' <PERSON> Lavalla </PERSON>, a hospital worker, recalled her husband saying. But she replied, `` Let's get back to earth now, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>.'' The couple's attorney informed <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials of the check, which was returned Thursday. `` After she told them the amount of my check there was a very lo-o-o-ong pause,'' said <PERSON> Lavalla </PERSON>. `` They were flabbergasted by the amount.'' <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION>, said the the refund check `` is kind of extreme.

 In what may rank as one of the great political compromises, the <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> came up with a way to name the same bridge for two people.

 Beer and liquor producers say requiring alcoholic beverage containers to carry health warning labels will do little to solve problems of abuse. `` Labels are not education, and they do n't really help solve the problem of abuse,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Beer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. `` We think it's really a false solution to a real problem.'' He called legislation to require such labels `` an emotional overreaction.'' Earlier, a bipartisan group of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers held a news conference to outline their labeling legislation. `` The most harmful drug in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is alcohol,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <PERSON> R-S.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, who introduced his bill in February, said alcohol abuse costs the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy about $ 120 billion a year, including increased medical expenses and lost productivity. Alcohol-related traffic accidents claim 18,000 lives each year, he added. `` It's a very rare family in this country today that has not been hit by some of the ravages of alcoholism one way or another,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, a cosponsor of the bill. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the panel has scheduled a series of hearings on the alcohol problem. The legislation would require the placement of one of five alternating labels on each alcoholic beverage container. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., who introduced the House version of the bill Thursday, said the labels would warn about the dangers of drinking and driving, of drinking while pregnant and of combining alcohol with other drugs In addition the labels would say that alcohol may be addictive and that its consumption can increase the risk of developing hypertension, liver disease and cancer. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, an actress on the television series Falcon Crest, said her father was an alcoholic, but that he would have wanted his children to know the dangers of alcohol. `` It seems to me incredible that we do not have these warning labels on alcohol bottles when it is such a dangerous drug,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubinski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> representative for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcoholism </ORGANIZATION>, said the primary source of alcohol information available to the American public comes from $ 2 billion in advertising aimed at depicting alcohol as `` a glamorous, magic potion.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lubinski </PERSON> said the warning labels will institutionalize public health messages about the risks associated with alcohol consumption. But <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the Distilled Spirits Council of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said the group opposes warning labels. `` We believe that the warning labels for alcohol beverage containers are unnecessary,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>. `` And they are unnecessary because the claims concerning the risks of alcohol consumption are well known.''

 F-16 fighter jets swooshed across the sky and paratroopers performed precision jumps as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> displayed its military might in a 40th Independence Day celebration marred by the Palestinian uprising. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> visited troops in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> and called for restraint in quelling Arab protests in the occupied lands, saying excessive force would only radicalize Palestinians. `` If we act with restraint, they -LRB- the Arabs -RRB- will realize that violence leads them nowhere, and they will have to look for a solution, and we're ready to talk about a solution,'' said <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' political rival, took a hard stand, saying: `` The Arab side is still not ready for peace.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, head of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that peace talks `` should n't take place under the -LRB- threat -RRB- of stone-throwing and violence.'' The fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION>, which has growing support in the territories, issued an underground booklet calling for a stepped-up struggle against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Our style of resistance is according to what <PERSON> God </PERSON> told us: Kill them wherever you find them. This is the solution for those who follow the Koran,'' the Moslem holy book, the booklet said. Few clashes were reported Thursday in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the lands <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. General strikes paralyzed towns and cities Thursday in the occupied lands, where about 400,000 Arabs, nearly a third of the population there, remained under curfew for a fifth day. For a second day, the army closed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> residents of the occupied lands. The security measure for Independence Day was to remain in effect until after Moslem prayers today. Journalists were barred from most parts of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. In the Arab village of <LOCATION> Isawiya </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police fired rubber bullets at Palestinians who threw stones and raised black flags to mourn slain <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> military commander <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>. New details emerged about Saturday's assassination of <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, who was gunned down at his home in a suburb of the Tunisian capital, <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. A Tunisian report said the job was done by an elite Israeli commando squad and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources, speaking privately to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, agreed. The Israeli sources also have told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> that the team operated under the direct command of Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> and stole documents during the raid at <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s home. The sources said the government approved the operation on two previous occasions in recent weeks but canceled it at the last minute for technical reasons. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s government has refused comment, and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Thursday: `` I do n't think anyone has anything to say about this.'' Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> topped off its Independence Day celebrations with a military show watched by about 40,000 people at <LOCATION> Ramat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and broadcast live on television. Fighter planes spewing blue-and-white steam, the flag colors, flew loops and circled in formations spelling the numeral 40. U.S.-made F-16s crossed the sky and paratroopers in white jumpsuits performed precision freefall jumps from 45,000 feet. One waved an Israeli flag as he glided toward the stadium floor. `` We all love the army and our soldiers,'' said <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON>, a police officer deployed at one of the stadium gates. `` It's a day that unites the country.'' <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON>, who would not give his last name, said the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> uprising dampened his joy, adding: `` We want to live in peace with the Arabs, but they are not ready to accept this.'' Since the Dec. 8 start of the anti-occupation protests, 169 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> stayed independent because it has been able to protect itself,'' said one of the cheering spectators, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlussel </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Teaneck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is getting a bad press because of what is happening in the territories. We came here to express our support.'' Elsewhere, Israelis celebrated the anniversary with picnics, hikes, fireworks and the annual international Bible quiz, in which 17-year-old <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Weider </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Monsey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, tied for first place. As an Independence Day present to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> signed the most comprehensive pact to date between the two countries, formalizing economic and military agreements. The agreement, signed in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, will be binding for future administrations. `` This is the most friendly administration we have ever worked with,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. `` They are determined that the strong friendship and cooperation will continue and even be strengthened despite the differences that crop up from time to time.''

<HEAD>Budget Deficit Surges In March</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal budget deficit grew more than expected in March, but the cumulative red ink in the first six months of the fiscal year is still 3.5 percent smaller than a year ago, the government says. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that the March deficit was $ 29.1 billion, up from $ 23.9 billion in February and 2.7 percent larger than March 1987. Economists had been predicting a monthly deficit of $ 24 billion to $ 26 billion. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of an economic forecasting service in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said some federal spending was probably deferred to March from February, when outlays were somewhat smaller than expected. Analysts also said the budget imbalance is usually higher in March than in other months because people who owe taxes generally wait until April to pay, while those due a refund normally file early. For the first half of the 1988 fiscal year, the government has run a deficit of $ 118.9 billion, 3.5 percent lower than the red ink incurred for the same period a year ago. For the entire fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is projecting a deficit of $ 146.7 billion, down 2.4 percent from the $ 150.4 billion deficit in 1987. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates the deficit will climb to $ 157 billion. Last year, the deficit fell sharply because of an unexpected $ 28 billion windfall in tax payments made by people who sold off long-term assets before the capital gains rates were increased under the new tax law. Some analysts say there could be a second, smaller windfall this year if people end up owing more in taxes for 1987 than they would have under the old tax law. `` April is the big question mark with the tax returns coming in,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. In March, government revenue totaled $ 65 billion, while spending totaled $ 94.1 billion. For the first half of the year, revenues total $ 412.0 billion while spending amounted to $ 530.9 billion. As usual, the largest spending categories in March were the military followed by Social Security, interest on the national debt and other programs in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Military spending totaled $ 25.8 billion last month and $ 142.3 billion for the fiscal year so far, up 5.6 percent from the same period a year ago. Spending for Social Security totaled $ 18.4 billion last month and $ 105.0 billion for the past six months, up 5.6 percent from the same period in the 1987 fiscal year. Social Security is exempted from budget limitations under the Gramm-Rudman law and is therefore generally showing faster spending increases than the other categories. The other HHS programs, including <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid, spent $ 14.2 billion in March and $ 77.5 billion so far this budget year, a 5.9 percent increase over 1987. Interest on the $ 2.5 trillion national debt _ nearly one fifth of total government spending _ was $ 14.4 billion last month and $ 105.2 billion so far this fiscal year, an increase of 9.6 percent over the same period last year.

 Congressional permission to transfer $ 8 million in <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> money from administration to the superconducting super collider avoids delays in the physics research project, the department says. Most of the money will be used to prepare environmental impact statements on prospective sites, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Keif </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Thursday. `` We have to go through that in order to select a site, so it keeps us on schedule,'' <PERSON> Keif </PERSON> said. Had the transfer of money been rejected, `` it just would have delayed things,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pursell </PERSON>, R-Mich., said the transfer was cleared by an agreement between <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairmen concerned with funding for the $ 4.4 billion project, which physicists plan to use to study the basic structure of matter `` Obviously, this approval demonstrates a certain level of support for the project within the subcommittee leadership which, as an advocate of the project, I'm delighted to see,'' said <PERSON> Pursell </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> energy appropriations subcommittee. Requests to transfer money that has already been appropriated require the consent of the chairman and ranking minority member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittees handling the money. The $ 8 million had been appropriated for the 1988 fiscal year. The committees last month had denied the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s request to transfer the money amid substantial congressional opposition to the project Seven states have been selected as potential sites for the super collider, which will include a 53-mile-round particle accelerator. The finalists are <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve $ 363 million for the project for fiscal 1989, although <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> supporters have said they would seek $ 100 million because of budget-balancing concerns. The project is expected to create 4,000 permanent jobs and have an annual budget of $ 280 million.

 An American survivor of the 1943 escape from <ORGANIZATION> Sobibor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp, who has waged a lonely fight to have it preserved as a memorial, returned this week and wept at the sound of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s national anthem. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Blatt </PERSON>, surrounded by a small group of friends, joined them in singing the Hatikvah, or The Hope. They stood next to the grass-covered mound of ashes and bones which likely contains the remains of both of <PERSON> Blatt </PERSON>'s parents and of his little brother. `` I could never imagine that I could stand here someday and hear singing of the Hatikvah in this spot,'' said <PERSON> Blatt </PERSON>, 60, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` I hope there is another world and that all the people, from <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> -LRB- who also died at <LOCATION> Sobibor </LOCATION> -RRB- are listening too,'' he said. It was a day of vindication for <PERSON> Blatt </PERSON>. He was accompanied by a Polish official who confirmed publicly that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would replace an erroneous sign at the camp's entrance which lists the 250,000 victims as Soviet prisoners of war, Jews, Poles and Gypsies. `` Here the victims were all Jews,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Holocaust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sites </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, founded by <PERSON> Blatt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Blatt </PERSON>, a Polish Jew, was 15 when he arrived at <LOCATION> Sobibor </LOCATION> in April 1943. He watched as his mother, father and brother were marched off to their deaths. He was spared by the caprice of the camp commander, who needed a shoeshine boy. Six months later, <PERSON> Blatt </PERSON> took part in the camp's successful uprising, in which most of the Nazis were killed and 300 prisoners escaped. About 50 of those escaped prisoners survived the war. The story was the topic of a CBS television movie last year, `` Escape from <LOCATION> Sobibor </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Blatt </PERSON> survived the war, fighting with partisans against the Germans, and eventually emigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He has revisited the camp many times and has repeatedly protested its unkempt condition and the misleading sign. <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilczur </PERSON>, a historian with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Main Commission for the Investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimes-Institute </ORGANIZATION> of National Remembrance, for agreeing to change the inscription. Noting that <LOCATION> Sobibor </LOCATION> was the site of the only successful mass uprising at a concentration camp, <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON> said: `` We would like to thank you for restoring a page in Jewish history. There are still people who think Jews went like sheep into places like this. And it's not true. Here, at the site of their biggest revolt, I'd like to thank you.'' <PERSON> Blatt </PERSON> obtained the promises from Polish officials to correct the sign and make other improvements in a meeting last August. When he returned to the camp Wednesday, he found flowers planted in front of the mound, a fresh coat of paint along the borders and a glass exhibition case at the entrance showing an architect's plans for the camp Among the changes planned are fencing in the camp, reshaping pathways, erecting exhibits that would tell the story of <LOCATION> Sobibor </LOCATION>, and encircling the mound with Jewish cemetery tombstones, which were torn down by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> for use as paving. Polish workers will make the improvements with money raised by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The project is expected to cost $ 375,000. <PERSON> Blatt </PERSON> had another suggestion for the architect. Walking to a field near the mound, where the camp crematoriums were located, he reached at random into the dirt and sifted pieces of human bone through his fingers. He said that the field is used by farmers to graze cattle and should be covered with a concrete slab to protect the remains. <PERSON> Wilczur </PERSON>, in his remarks to the group of about 20 people, said Polish Jews and non-Jews alike shared a common awful fate at the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. `` The died for the same reason: Because one was a Jew and the other a Pole,'' he said. Referring to the 3 million Polish Jews killed in the Holocaust, about the same number as non-Jewish Poles who died under the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wilczur </PERSON> said: `` They were truly our brothers, in life, in the moment of dying, and now in their graves.'' <PERSON> Wilczur </PERSON> added: `` Any kind of chauvinism, nationalism, totalitarianism, leads in the end to a <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> or a <LOCATION> Sobibor </LOCATION>. One they call <LOCATION> Sobibor </LOCATION>, another they call <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>,'' the site in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> where about 4,000 Polish officers were found executed in World War II. `` Murder is murder. The blood of innocents is the blood of innocents.''

 Cancer patients who got morphine at the touch of a button to relieve pain stopped using the drug sooner, and used little more than half the narcotic than patients who got a continuous infusion, a researcher says. `` These patients do n't even come close to developing addiction,'' said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, associate research director at the <ORGANIZATION> Pain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> and director of the pain and toxicity research program at the <ORGANIZATION> Fred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutchinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The shorter time on the drug is important because it means an earlier end to confusion, sedation and other unpleasant reactions that accompany morphine treatment, he said. `` In order to cope you need all your marbles. You ca n't be coping effectively when you're on the drug,'' he said. He spoke in a recent interview about research done with <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> colleagues including <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Costantino </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> and others. They studied hospitalized patients who had undergone bone marrow transplantation as part of cancer therapy. As a result of cancer treatment, such patients commonly suffer pain for two or three weeks in the mouth and through the digestive tract, and sometimes in the hands and feet and elsewhere, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. In the study, 32 patients got a continuous infusion of morphine through an intravenous line, the standard treatment, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. Twenty-six others got doses by pushing a button on an electric pump hooked up to an intravenous line. The pump was programmed to give no more than one milligram of morphine every 10 minutes. For each group, the decision to stop treatment was made jointly between the patient and medical staff, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. Patients who controlled their morphine used the drug an average of about 13 days, while those who received a continuous intravenous infusion averaged more than 17 days. The self-administering group also used only 53 percent as much morphine as the other patients. While the study was not designed to look for addiction, no self-adminstering patient reported cravings for the drug after the treatment stopped, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. Self-administration of drugs might be useful for prolonged pain of serious burns or terminal stages of cancer, he said. It would not be suitable for pain that lasts for years, such as some cases of low back pain, he said. So-called `` patient-controlled analgesia'' has been studied extensively for short-term pain like that following surgery. But the new work is the first large-scale study involving long-term pain, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, associate professor of neurology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION>. The study is important because it shows patients can safely control the amount of drug they get, gaining relief without overdosing, he said. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said results of the study have been submitted for publication in a scientific journal. He spoke while in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to receive a $ 50,000 pain research grant to the university from the Bristol-Myers Co.. Other pain grants were awarded to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Ann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>Women in Military at Post-War High</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of women in the military has climbed to 10.3 percent of the total force, a post-World War II high, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> continues to see improvement in the educational levels of its active-duty personnel. It also posted a small increase last year in the number of civilian workers on the payroll, and is paying out pensions to more than 1.5 million individuals. And by all measures, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> continues to lead the nation in the number of individuals working for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Those and other statistics are contained in the latest edition of an annual <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> study entitled `` Selected Manpower Statistics.'' The new edition, published Thursday, consists of 222 pages of tables and covers fiscal 1987, which ended Sept. 30. The annual report offers the most comprehensive view available of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employment patterns, as well as indicators of where that force lives and how age, sex, education and family patterns are changing. The latest edition shows that as of Sept. 30, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had 2,160,727 men and women on active duty; another 13,490 men and women in the three military academies, and 1,174,826 civilian employees around the world, including foreign nationals. The active-duty total was essentially static compared to fiscal 1986 _ up about 5,100 _ while `` DoD civilian personnel increased by about 21,800'' during the fiscal year, the report shows. Both the active-duty and civilian employment figures are declining this year and will continue to fall to accommodate cuts in the fiscal 1989 budget. In a section on active-duty trends, the report discloses that there are now 222,338 female officers and enlisted personnel and another 1,467 women in the various military academies, for a total of 223,805. That represents 10.3 percent of the military force and is the highest level recorded since 1945 when World War II ended with 266,256 women in the military. The report also shows that women managed to increase their presence slightly at the military academies, where new officers are trained. In fiscal 1985, females comprised 10.33 percent of the academy students. In fiscal 1986, the figure climbed to 10.63 percent and last year, to 10.9 percent. The report says 53.35 percent of all military personnel are now married _ down slightly from the 54.6 percent reported in fiscal 1986 _ and military personnel are supporting 2.8 million dependents, also down slightly from the previous year. Every service _ the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> _ continues to have more military dependents than it does active-duty personnel, the report shows. On the educational side, the percentage of enlisted personnel in the military who have completed high school increased by almost a full percentage point last year _ from 96.5 percent to 97.2 percent. Earlier reports have shown a dramatic increase in the number of new recruits with a high-school degree; the manpower study, however, covers all enlisted personnel and not just recruits. The study also shows there are now 1.53 million `` military annuitants'' supported by the Pentagon. An annuitant is an individual who has either retired with a pension after a minimum 20 years of service, retired with benefits because of a disability, or is a family entitled to survivor benefits. Most of the annuitants _ about 1.2 million _ are regular pensioners. In 1950, there were only 58,752 such retirees. The increase has already prompted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to revise the pension system with an eye toward cutting future costs. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> easily held down its longstanding No. 1 ranking in <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees, with 206,495 military personnel and 137,677 civilians for a total of 344,172. It was followed by <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> with 208,588 military and civilian workers combined, then <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with 202,027; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> with 110,952; <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with 109,057, and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> with 103,140.

 Government officials are considering removing a popular anti-acne drug from the market because they estimate it has caused more than 900 babies to be born with severe birth defects, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. The officials said they are also considering asking the maker of Accutane, <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to limit severely its distribution, the newspaper said. The drug is used against disfiguring acne. A spokeswoman for the manufacturer Thursday night disputed the figures, saying it has reports of 62 cases of Accutane-related birth defects among the 700,000 to 1 million patients with cystic acne for whom the drug has been prescribed. Despite clear warnings that the drug can cause devastating and sometimes fatal deformities if taken by pregnant women, experts estimate thousands have taken Accutane during pregnancy since it came on the market in 1982, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. In a confidential memorandum dated Feb. 11 and obtained Thursday by the Times, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> estimated that 900 to 1,300 babies were born with severe birth defects because of the drug from 1982 to 1986. They also attributed 700 to 1,000 spontaneous abortions to the use of Accutane, and they estimated that an additional 5,000 to 7,000 women had induced abortions `` solely because of Accutane exposure and fear of birth defects,'' the newspaper reported. The estimates were extrapolated from data collected in a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Medicaid study. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman-LaRoche </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nutley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said the company would meet with the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to discuss ways to better educate the public, doctors and pharmacists about the dangerous, and often fatal side effects. `` We do not want to dispute the fact that this drug is associated with birth defects,'' she said. `` We want to find ways to further reinforce that message.'' Ms. <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> said that in the 62 cases of birth defects known to the company, the babies were born with severe disfigurations, primarily malformations of the head and ears. About half the afflicted children died at birth, she said. Accutane accounts for between $ 40 million and $ 50 million in sales annually, she said. The drug shuts down the production of sebum, which is the oily fatty susbstance that causes the inflamation, pain and eventualy scarring of cystic acne. The drug's generic name is isotretinoin. By September 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> drug agency had received reports of only 52 babies with Accutane-caused deformities, according to the Times. Officials believe that many women and their doctors did not always recognize the link between the drug and deformities in babies. Accutane carries a strong warning label and the company has conducted extensive campaigns to publicize its risk of causing birth defects. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, a dermatologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, agreed the situation `` is a serious problem,'' but he said Accutane is the only treatment available for many patients with disfiguring acne. `` Accutane is an extremely important drug,'' he told the Times. He stressed that severe acne, left uncontrolled, `` scars patients both physically and psychologically.''

 The political spotlight shines briefly in state after state before the candidates _ and the attention _ move on. Left behind are supporters who continue the lonely fight for delegates in sometimes long, drawn-out selection processes. Fifteen states are still involved in multi-step caucuses and conventions to select delegates to the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, July 18-21. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> may be ancient political history to some, but for the Democratic hopefuls these and other caucus states hold 599 of the 2,081 delegates needed to nominate. And in some states, the possibility exists for candidates to improve on delegate totals as the caucus system proceeds. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, the three-step process ended this past weekend with state conventions. Changing political fortunes enabled <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to pick up seven delegates in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> after early precinct results projected none for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> finished with 28 and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> got eight. In other caucus states, the campaigns are renewing their efforts as the large number of precinct delegates decide whom they will vote for at congressional district and state conventions. `` In the states where there's a big uncommitted bloc at the tier lower than the CD -LRB- congressional district -RRB- level ... we have an equal opportunity,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brophy </PERSON>, a delegate counter for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> back on Feb. 8, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was the winner in the precinct caucuses with <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> second and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> third. Based on those results, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had enough precinct delegates to assure him of 20 national delegates. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has since withdrawn, and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who was in line for 17 delegates, has suspended campaigning though he wants to keep his delegates. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had enough support for 17 national delegates. As the May 14 district conventions near, when Iowans will pick `` real, live, breathing national delegates,'' in the words of <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> communications director <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON>, the campaigns are focusing on the uncommitted, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> delegates to the district conventions. `` There's been some movement toward <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but not wholesale,'' <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON> said. `` The <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> people want to see what happens, or at least at the state convention -LRB- June 25 -RRB- have some strength to get people elected. `` So much attention is placed on being first,'' <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON> said. `` But <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> is the longest, spread out over five months. You have to see it from beginning to end. ... No decision is set in stone.'' The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign has used its local volunteers in an effort to pick up <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> delegates, while the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> forces re-opened their <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> office and have a staffer preparing for the conventions, according to <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON>. Their work, however, may be overshadowed by this week's primary results in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and results from approaching primaries, which could sway delegates before the district conventions. `` This is a critical time,'' <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON> said. Other states with long selection processes include <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, which held local caucuses on Feb. 28, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> emerged with 10 delegates and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> eight, but a large bloc remained uncommitted. The candidates, looking toward the state's May 13-15 state convention, see the uncommitted numbers as fertile territory for padding their totals. `` Both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have made a concentrated effort,'' said <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, chairman of the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're trying to build on their numbers. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had a meeting in <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION> with over 100 people. ... Whoever does the job over the next three weeks will reap the benefits.'' The party itself is enjoying the fruits of the candidates' labor as close to 3,000 people are expected at the state convention in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. `` It will be the largest ever, due in large part to this issue,'' <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> said. Party leaders in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, where congressional district conventions will be held Saturday, see <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegates holding solid, but expect some movement among the uncommitted and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> delegates. `` Things do change between March 19 and April 23,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman.

<HEAD>Team Says It Snubbed Tobacco Company Sponsorship; Wins Doctors'
Support</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A doctors' anti-smoking group has decided to sponsor the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> boomerang team after the team said it turned down a deal for TV coverage and $ 15,000 in support from the <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> tobacco company. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blum </PERSON>, chairman and founder of Doctors Ought to Care, or <ORGANIZATION> DOC </ORGANIZATION>, says the group wants to underscore dangers of tobacco company sponsorship of sports, especially the recruiting of new smokers among youthful sports fans. `` By putting the athletes out there with a no-smoking image we're going to make the point in a cost-effective way with kids around the world,'' <PERSON> Blum </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Thursday. The nation's two largest tobacco companies, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, sponsor a wide range of sporting events. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> has the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Slims tennis tournament and supports auto racing and soccer in connection with Marlboro cigarettes. <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> supports auto races with its Camel and Winston cigarettes and golf tournaments with Vantage cigarettes. Such efforts, <PERSON> Blum </PERSON> said, are telling youth that `` being a tennis player or a soccer player goes hand-in-hand with being a Marlboro man.'' <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> disputed the team's version of events. `` We rejected them,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, the company's manager of media relations. `` They had no opportunity to reject us. As soon as we found out that some members of the team had concerns about being sponsored by a tobacco company, we decided not to pursue the sponsorship idea any further.'' About <PERSON> Blum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said, `` In his usual frothing-at-the-mouth hysteria, he's trying to create a large situation out of something that's really minor and meaningless.'' `` We're trying to do something,'' said <PERSON> Blum </PERSON>. `` We're trying to spark the outrage that's needed and get rid of tobacco and sports once and for all.'' DOC opposes the promotion of alcohol and tobacco and tries to educate the public to the dangers of drug abuse. The boomerang team is trying to raise the $ 12,000 the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> boomerang team needs to go to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> for the World Cup of Boomerang Competition May 6-15 in <LOCATION> Barooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Snouffer </PERSON>, a gymnastics instructor in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and captain of the team, said the <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> deal would have required team members to, among other things, wear the <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> logo on national television. `` The decision was made to forego said money and take a stance for boomerangs as a positive health promotion, and not linked to a tobacco company,'' <PERSON> Snouffer </PERSON> said in a statement. In addition to <PERSON> Snouffer </PERSON>, who took first place at the boomerang world championships in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1985, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team is made up of <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strafford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, who finished second in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Barnaby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. When the idea of <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> sponsorship was raised, <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON>, who has asthma and is strongly opposed to smoking, refused to don the tobacco company logo. `` I offered to withdraw from the team,'' he said. The team decided, instead, to reject the <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> offer, <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Blum </PERSON> and DOC have raised $ 2,000 so far, and small contributions from individuals are trickling in, <PERSON> Blum </PERSON> said. That leaves the team $ 10,000 short, however, with scarcely more than a week before their May 1 departure. `` We're looking for individuals or others to pick that up, or else we're going to have to pay it out of our own pockets,'' <PERSON> Snouffer </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` But we've kind of set a precedent.'' `` I think they shot themselves in the foot,'' says the agent who had arranged the <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> deal, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> of the Fifi Oscard Agency in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` If <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> wanted to get behind the sport, you're talking about making boomerangs into Frisbees. I do n't know whether that was in their marketing plans, but if the sport caught on they could have adopted it.''

<HEAD>$4.6 Billion Star Wars Budget Endorsed by Senate Panel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars missile defense system has fared better in early-round budget votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> than in the House. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee meeting behind closed doors voted late Thursday to authorize $ 4.6 billion in the next fiscal year for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. The decision by the subcommittee on strategic weapons and nuclear deterrence came as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> began writing its version of the $ 299 billion bill providing for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget during the 12 months which begin Oct. 1. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had originally sought $ 4.8 billion for the program, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative. Next week, the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will begin considering its version of the Pentagon budget bill, which includes $ 4 billion for Star Wars. The current SDI budget is $ 3.9 billion. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel, said he expects the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> eventually to grant about $ 4 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, despite attempts by conservatives to raise the figure and liberals to cut it Differences between the bills which eventually emerge from each chamber will have to be reconciled by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. Both measures provide a total of $ 299 billion, a figure that was already known before the long congressional budget process started three months ago. The total was agreed upon last December by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional negotiators as they put together a plan aimed at reducing federal budget deficits. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee also generally granted administration requests for the Midgetman and MX missiles, the sources said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had wanted $ 200 million for research into the single-warhead Midgetman and $ 800 million for research into basing the 10-warhead MX weapon aboard trains on western military reservations. By contrast, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure also raises spending on the Midgetman to $ 500 million, while reducing the MX request to $ 500 million. The Midgetman is a single-warhead missile backed by congressional Democrats but opposed by the Pentagon. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he wanted to eliminate the Midgetman program entirely, but agreed to include $ 200 million at the request of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to keep the program alive until <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor can make a decision about its fate

 <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Ampatzis </PERSON> is a businessman with conservative views who twice voted for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But when it came to supporting Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for president, he never hesitated. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he's got the guts. I believe <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a strong man, better than -LRB- Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Ampatzis </PERSON>, who came to this country in 1969 from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is the son of <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> immigrants and has attracted strong loyalty in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s small but proud <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> community as Tuesday's <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary approaches. <PERSON> Ampatzis </PERSON>, 52, who owns two downtown restaurants, sent to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> bumper stickers even before the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor opened a campaign office here. Those stickers adorn his delivery trucks, and a sign in a front window at his restaurant lists the names of delegate candidates who are pledged to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` This shows we are something,'' he said. `` It makes Greeks more American. People say ` You are an immigrant.' They look down on you. This shows we are part of this country. I feel very proud.'' His friend, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savvas </PERSON> of suburban <LOCATION> Havertown </LOCATION>, remembers discrimination from the 1950s. `` People called us dishwashers,'' he said. He especially likes the way <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shows pride in his heritage. `` Everywhere he goes he says ` I am Greek-American.' That makes every Greek-American feel good.'' Support from the Greek community has been important since the early days when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> set off on his quest for the Democratic nomination for president, says press secretary <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>. `` They were crucial in terms of initial support to the campaign,'' <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said. `` I can generally say the Greek-American community has been extraordinarily generous.'' `` People put $ 10, $ 15 in an envelope and mail it to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Ampatzis </PERSON>. `` Like the ancient Greeks said: If you do n't participate, you have nothing. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Famous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> contributes in another way, occasionally sending over a few pizzas for the volunteers at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> headquarters. `` Many of these volunteers are students, with no money,'' he said with a shrug. `` We have to support them. Many other restaurants are doing the same thing.'' Ethnic group voting is a hallowed practice in American politics. It is why blacks are voting for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by margins like 95 percent over his white rivals. It is why <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON> won 94 percent of the Italian-American vote over his rivals in the 1983 Democratic mayoral primary. `` If you do n't know where a candidate stands,'' said former city controller <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Vignola </PERSON>, `` you can figure that a candidate who shares your ethnic heritage is going to be more in line with your thinking, share your concerns. It's perfectly natural.'' <PERSON> Ampatzis </PERSON> believes <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will win the support of an even larger ethnic group in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> _ the Italians. `` All the Greeks voted for <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON>,'' he said. `` We're like brothers, the Italians and the Greeks. Look back at our history. The Italians will be for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 100 percent.'' City Councilman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Tayoun </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lebanese-American </LOCATION> whose district includes large numbers of Italian voters, agrees. `` Anybody whose name has got a little life to it will do well down here,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is that kind of name.'' But <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON>, now campaign manager for <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, does not believe the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ethnic appeal will be strong enough. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been criticized in some quarters for being too bland and non-controversial, but <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that, `` As far as I'm concerned, he's a radical.'' `` His positions are just not the positions of the ethnics that I was born and raised with,'' <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Savvas </PERSON> insists that he is n't supporting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> just because of their shared heritage. `` He is a good man,'' he said. `` He comes from a good family. He's got a very good program.'' Still, neither he nor Ampatzis can think of a single Greek-American they know who would support another candidate. `` I do n't think any <PERSON> Greek-American </PERSON> would say that, except for someone who was really mixed up in Republican politics,'' <PERSON> Savvas </PERSON> said. `` And when those people get in the voting booth, they will be for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.''

<TEXT>
 A man who was inspired by the deadly 1980 MGM Grand Hotel fire in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, to invent a portable smoke alarm has won a $ 3.32 million judgment against companies that marketed a similar device. The federal court verdict Wednesday protects <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Stilwell </PERSON>'s contractual rights to SleepSafe, which straps over a hotel room door and is designed to sound an alarm and shine a light when smoke is detected. <PERSON> Stilwell </PERSON> survived a fire in his home before the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> blaze that left 84 people dead. He checked out of the MGM Grand three days earlier. `` That's what tripped it off,'' <PERSON> Stillwell </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I registered my idea within two days of the MGM fire. I did n't even go to work for three days.'' The lawsuit stemmed from <PERSON> Stilwell </PERSON>'s contract with two <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> businessmen to help secure certification from Underwriters Laboratories to permit the alarm to be sold at major retail stores. The contract then called for the companies to take over distribution, with a percentage of the profits going to <LOCATION> Stilwell </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stilwell </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roddy </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chong </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> corporation headed by <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Palos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verdes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scitec </ORGANIZATION>, the company's <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> representative, never delivered on their promises and began distributing a similar device.

 Survivors and relatives of victims of the 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Edmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> massacre filed a $ 75 million lawsuit Thursday holding the Edmond postmaster, the Police Department and members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> reponsible. Postal worker <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> shot and killed 14 co-workers and wounded six others on Aug. 20, 1986, before taking his own life. The lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of 11 relatives of the victims and the six wounded, is the second to seek damages in the massacre. The suit alleges that <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowlkes </PERSON>, postmaster at Edmond at the time, authorized putting pressure on <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> in hopes of forcing his resignation and should have known that <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> was unstable. <PERSON> Fowlkes </PERSON>, who retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on March 13, said Thursday he was in charge of 125 people and `` I did n't know them that well.'' The suit also faulted the <ORGANIZATION> Edmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for not immediately storming the post office during the shooting rampage, which last more than an hour. Then-Police Chief <PERSON> Clent </PERSON> <PERSON> Dedek </PERSON>, now <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>'s public safety commissioner, said Thursday he had not seen the suit and declined comment. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials _ one of them an unidentified marksmanship coordinator _ were accused of failing to investigate <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON>'s background before giving him access to guns and ammunition. The suit alleged that the coordinator should have discovered that <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> had threatened to kill a weapons instructor. <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> was a Guard marksmen authorized to check out pistols and ammunition. The Guard said the two .45 - caliber handguns <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> carried into the post office had been issued to him for practice and a In December, the family of <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON>, who was killed in the attack, sued the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, the city of <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON>'s estate in state court seeking unspecified damages That case has not gone to trial.

 When <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahern </PERSON> arrived at her daughter's home about a week ago, she found an empty house, strangers at the door and family mementos in the trash The house, she learned, had been hurriedly sold, and her pregnant daughter, her son-in-law and grandchild had vanished. A few days later, she said, her 35-year-old daughter called to say, `` ` Hi, Mommy. We're in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> praising the Lord.''' `` I said, ` <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, you're sick. Please come home.' And with that she hung up.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ahern </PERSON>, of suburban <LOCATION> Broomall </LOCATION>, is among a group of 40 people in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> who believe their children have fallen prey to a Christian cult inspired by a southern radio evangelist called Brother R.G. Stair. She said <PERSON> Stair </PERSON>'s broadcast predictions of nuclear holocaust induced her children to sell their belongings for a song and seek shelter at his organization's farm in <LOCATION> Walterboro </LOCATION>, S.C. Under his command or the dictates of his agents, his followers have abandoned their families and friends, signed over their funds and upended their lives, other parents said. `` That's ridiculous,'' said <PERSON> Stair </PERSON>, a 54-year-old self-proclaimed prophet, from his 74-acre farm on Thursday. `` There is no power that I have that compels people to do anything. I'm like a doctor or a lawyer. I can give my opinion, I can tell them what's best for them, and that's as far as I can go.'' `` They have been under mind control, absolutely that's what it is, for months on end,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ahern </PERSON> insisted. `` They were like puppets on a string. If they were told to do something they did it.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Guidice </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> Broomall </LOCATION>, said she has put a lien on her daughter's house to try to stop her from leaving town. `` They think the world is going to end, we are all going to die and go to hell, except his people who go down south. There they are going to be safe,'' she said. The parents have sought support from two area pastors and the <ORGANIZATION> Cult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awareness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, a national non-profit group based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The president of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> afflilate, <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Stair </PERSON>'s organization has all the characteristics of a cult, and she compared him to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, whose followers committed mass suicide in <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>. `` It's very important to recognize that the potential for tragedy is quite high,'' she said. `` When a leader has that much control over people, then you know they can gain more control.'' Stair, originally from <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said the comparison was baseless. He said his 40 followers voluntarily chose a Christian life of self-denial in the country `` where the cost of living is cheaper.'' Law enforcement officials say they have found no illegalities in the cult's practices. `` Everybody that we've talked to who is associated with this religion is doing it of their own free will, and he -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Stair </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has n't threatened anybody,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Auld </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent in suburban <LOCATION> Newtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> `` They are freely giving over their possessions to the community.'' The three families who arrived from the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and the other followers are free to come and go, free to receive visitors and manage their funds in their own accounts, he said. Together they believe that the economy will collapse in May; that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will not complete his term; and that nuclear war will envelop the world before the year is out, he said. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a self-described Christian counselor from <LOCATION> Broomall </LOCATION> now at the farm, said he has promoted <PERSON> Stair </PERSON>'s teachings in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> for more than a year, although he first met Stair only within the last six months. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said he announced his plan to join <PERSON> Stair </PERSON>, but exerted no pressure upon the nine families who comprised his congregation. Mrs. <PERSON> Ahern </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> McCourt </PERSON>, did not return telephone calls to the farm on Thursday.

 A lawyer who helped defend <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, the U-2 spy pilot downed over the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1960, was convicted in federal court Thursday of plotting to smuggle drugs and launder money.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> did not remove himself from government decisions involving the wealthy <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family that supplies his wife's salary until a news report disclosed that a <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership had won a $ 50 million lease for <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offices, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s spokesman says. Responding to questions Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` indicated to me that as of his first hearing about any matter of the department that might involve the Benders, he has recused himself.'' <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> first learned of that relationship when he read an April 13 <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> story on the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 50 million lease in 1987 with the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership <PERSON> Eastland </PERSON> said he did not know whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had put his recusal decision in a written memo to aides. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s recusal came one week after <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family members signed a separate, $ 1.1-million deal to provide additional offices for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, government records show. That is the second major lease involving the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> since the family foundation began funding <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s job in January 1986. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials say he played no role in either lease and there was no connection between the deals and <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s salary. Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s $ 40,000-a-year salary at the <ORGANIZATION> Multiple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sclerosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> is paid by a grant from the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the family's tax-exempt philanthropy, according to MS attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierbower </PERSON> Recusal is a common way government officials and private lawyers avoid conflicts of interest, or the appearance of them, by removing themselves from decisions in which they may appear to benefit financially. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, general counsel of the Office of Government Ethics, said in an interview that recusal is the `` safer, prudent'' step for any Cabinet official who learns of a connection like the one involving the Meeses and Benders. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillers </PERSON>, an expert on legal ethics, said in an interview that `` it's a little late'' for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to recuse himself. `` Frankly, once she got the job, it was his job to inquire about the source of funds. ... As soon as he knew the Benders were the source directly or indirectly of Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s salary, he should have sent around -LRB- a -RRB- screening memorandum'' telling subordinates he would take no part in Bender-related decisions. Independent Counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is investigating Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s salary and the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family's real estate dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as part of his inquiry into whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has any criminal conflicts of interest Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> appeared before <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s grand jury Thursday. The Benders, two of whom have appeared before the grand jury, have refused to comment as has their attorney, <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Glanzer </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family has large real estate holdings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The family has built <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government buildings, including <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, and has leased several offices to the government. The <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family's role in paying Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s salary was publicly disclosed in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on March 30. On April 8, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the government housekeeping agency, signed a two-year lease for $ 694,236 coupled with a $ 430,000 renovation contract with <ORGANIZATION> Blake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Blake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, respectively. <ORGANIZATION> Blake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is a <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family firm. <ORGANIZATION> Blake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> is a partnership which includes three members of the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family, <ORGANIZATION> Blake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> and five other persons. When The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> first asked the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> on April 5-6 for all <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> or <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> leases with <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, this lease was not disclosed because negotiations were not final, <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> said. It was provided April 20 after The AP called back and specifically requested it based on information developed elsewhere. The lease covers 12,522 square feet on the fourth floor of The Blake Building, three blocks from the White House. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Marman </PERSON> said the space will be used by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> as a secure location for defense attorneys in the Iran-Contra conspiracy trial to review classified government documents. `` <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> was the only bidder who could meet our needs for space in the time frame we required,'' <PERSON> Marman </PERSON> said. The government wanted to move in May 1. The standard government contract was amended to include a special rider requiring <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> to monitor asbestos insulation in the building to avoid employee exposure to cancer-causing, breathable fibers. The <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> regularly tries to avoid leasing buildings with asbestos problems. `` This lease did not come to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s attention as far as Justice Management Division knows,'' <PERSON> Marman </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> came to our attention through the normal competitive bidding process of the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION>. We did not actively solicit anyone by name.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> contracting officer who signed the lease, said <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> submitted one of only two bids, both of which came from four companies solicited to bid. <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> learned of the <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> space from the <ORGANIZATION> Fred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ezra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a commercial real estate broker, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said. At the Ezra firm, broker <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rome </PERSON> said his firm was brought into the search by the Justice Management Division. <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> said Justice officials had nothing to do with his locating the <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> space. `` It was totally by coincidence that it was a <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> building,'' <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Marman </PERSON> confirmed that Justice called in the Ezra firm after its own officials were unable to find appropriate space. He said of the <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> location: `` With very little problem, it met our requirements.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> disclosed April 13 that a <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership had purchased a building housing <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 as the government planned to begin moving out. That move was canceled after the purchase, and the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership later signed a $ 50 million, 10-year lease renewal. The government lease enabled the partnership to sell the building in 1987 for $ 22.6 million more than it cost, the new owner said.

<TEXT>
 A tax credit for all families with preschool children and a massive $ 2.5 billion day care expansion are emerging as the key issues in a congressional debate on how to ease the nation's child care problems. Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said Thursday that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposes the $ 2.5 billion Act for Better Child Care. But he said the tax credit proposal meets the administration's standards for a child care policy and he personally favors it. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on human resources he did n't know whether the administration would offer its own child care tax credit plan or support other federal initiatives to help make care more affordable and available. `` I could n't tell you,'' he said. `` It's a matter of debate and discussion within the administration right now.'' Three approaches were discussed at the hearing: the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill backed by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders and scores of groups representing women, children, labor, churches and medical personnel; a tax credit bill sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-La </LOCATION>.; and a middle-ground proposal introduced by Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> bill would give all families a credit of $ 150 to $ 400 per preschool child, whether the children were cared for at home or elsewhere. Total cost: $ 800 million. The government already is spending $ 3.7 billion on a dependent care tax credit available to families with children in day care, <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said any child care policy endorsed by the administration would have to strengthen the family, treat stay-at-home mothers fairly, not promote any particular type of care, target funds to those most in need and help people without setting up a new bureaucracy. He said the <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> approach meets all those tests. The tax credit concept also appears to sidestep church-state problems cited by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which is in an odd alliance with conservatives in opposing the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> objections center on the possibility that religious-sponsored day care programs would qualify for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> grants and parent subsidies. The bill's sponsor, Rep. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON>, D-Mich., said he is working on changes to make sure churches are eligible, while the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> says the bill even as introduced violates the separation of church and state `` This is one big new federal trough for churches,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, legislative counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>. `` Too many of them want it and they're not willing to recognize the serious constitutional issues here.'' Three-quarters of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> money would help pay the child care bills in families making up to 115 percent of a state's median income. The rest would go for training and salaries for child care workers, renovation of facilities and referral programs for parents. A national advisory panel would develop minimum federal child care standards. Supporters of the bill say the federal government must play the lead role in helping to expand day care services, ensure their quality and make them more affordable to American families. But conservatives including <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlafly </PERSON> complained Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill is too expensive and cumbersome, promotes institutional care and discriminates against parents who stay at home with their children. And they said the income cutoff in the bill would let some families earning $ 40,000 get financial help. The Hatch-Johnson Child Care Services Improvement Act would give states $ 250 million in grant money for day care expansion and scholarships and $ 100 million to start risk pools to limit provider liability. Another $ 25 million would be available to help home providers meet state licensing requirements. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> have endorsed positions similar to the Hatch-Johnson approach.

<HEAD>Some Commonly Asked Questions About Airline Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here are the answers to frequently asked questions about the airline smoking ban that goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. Q: What flights are covered by the ban? A: Those that are scheduled, according to the Official Airline Guide, as lasting two hours or less. Charter flights and international flights and any flight by a foreign airline are exempt. Q: How many flights will be affected. A: About 80 percent of the roughly 17,300 daily domestic flights by the major airlines. Smoking already has been prohibited on commuter flights when the aircraft have 30 or fewer seats. Q: What if the flight is delayed in the air or on the ground and takes longer than two hours. A: The no-smoking ban still will apply as long as the scheduled time of the flight is two hours or less. Q: For the purposes of the smoking ban, what is considered a flight? A: A flight is any single segment between two cities. On a Washington-Los Angeles flight with a stop in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, for example, the ban would apply to the Washington-St. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> segment that is less than two hours, but not to the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis-Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> segment, which exceeds two hours Q: How do I determine whether a flight is two hours or less? A: Check the airline schedule or ask the travel agent to give you the scheduled departure and arrival times of each flight segment to determine the duration of the flight. Take note that the departure and arrival will be in local time and any change in time zones must be taken into account. Q: Who enforces the smoking ban? A: Normally a flight attendant will advise a passenger to stop smoking. If that does not work, the passenger will be asked to provide his or her name and address, which will be forwarded to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for enforcement action. If the passenger refuses to provide the information, he or she may be guilty of interfering with the operation of a flight crew, a federal crime, and may be subject to arrest upon landing. Q: What is the penalty for smoking on a no-smoking flight? A: A passenger may face a civil penalty of up to $ 1,000 for each offense. Tampering with a smoke detector in an aircraft lavatory carries a $ 2,000 fine. Q: If a flight has one stop and has both a smoking and no-smoking segment how does a traveler avoid being caught in the wrong section of the plane during one of the segments? A: Travelers should ask to be seated in the appropriate section of the aircraft at the beginning of the trip to avoid having to be re-seated. Even if the first segment of a flight prohibits smoking, the traveler should ask specifically to be seated in either a smoking or no-smoking section to avoid being in the wrong section during the second leg of the flight in which smoking is permitted. Q: If a traveler already holds a reservation or paid ticket for a seat in the smoking section of a two-hour-or-less flight will he or she be allowed to smoke after the rule goes into effect? A: No. Smoking still will be prohibited on that flight. Q: On some flights a trip between two cities may take less than two hours in one direction, but because of headwinds or traffic flow take more than two hours when returning. How does the smoke rule treat this? A: The smoking ban does not apply to flights of more than two hours. However, airlines are free to prohibit smoking on any flight if they wish to maintain consistency. Some airlines have chosen to impose a smoking ban on flights going in both direction between the same two cities if the elapsed times are similar. Q: Is there a way to find a no-smoking flight on trips of more than two hours? A: Airlines are free to prohibit smoking on flights of more than two hours. So far, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has decided to ban smoking on all flights within the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> regardless of duration. No other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline has done so. But a traveler could select a combination of flight segments each of which are two hours or less and have no-smoking flights throught a trip. This, however, may take longer and may cost more than the most direct flights. Q: What if I have a ticket on a flight where smoking is prohibit, but the flight is canceled or overbooked and the airline reroutes me to another flight that is more than two hours long. Is smoking permitted on the flight I take? A: Yes. The rule applies to whatever flight is actually taken. When passengers are rerouted they should check on the smoking status of the new flight and make their preferences known to the airline beforehand.

<HEAD>Subcommittee Strikes Down Effort To Delay Opening Arctic Refuge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Environmental groups have suffered another defeat in their battle with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the oil industry over opening the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> to petroleum development. The latest setback came Thursday as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation and the environment voted 17-9 against putting off a congressional decision on the refuge for at least two years. <PERSON> Syd </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said the margin of the defeat means that the subcommittee and then the full committee will probably approve a bill to allow oil rigs into the refuge in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. But a major proponent of such legislation, Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said he was n't as certain. `` I never count my chickens until I've got the bones in my mouth,'' he said. The drilling issue is a struggle between environmentalists, who want no development, and the administration and the oil industry, which say the refuge contains potentially rich oil deposits needed to offset growing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependence on imported petroleum. Drilling advocates won the first congressional round earlier this year when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 11-8 for a development bill that is awaiting floor debate. Pending in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee is a compromise plan by full committee chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, to allow phased leasing and development of the refuge's 1.5 million-acre coastal plain. The activity could begin as soon as 21 months after enactment so long as it did not significantly harm the pristine coastal plain or its wildlife, including a caribou herd whose principal calving area would be off-limits to rigs. The rejected amendment by Reps. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>, D-Wash., and <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, would have shelved the drilling issue until the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spent from two to three years drafting a national energy policy emphasizing conservation and renewable resources <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> said that an administration decision to cut vehicle-fleet efficiency standards would over the years waste 9 billion barrels of oil _ the most optimistic estimate of the refuge's reserves. Opponents argued that putting energy policy language into the refuge bill would kill it for this session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because it would have to be referred to an uncertain fate in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said environmentalists are more optimistic about their chances in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which also has jurisdiction over the issue and which traditionally has been more receptive to their desires. Interior's water and power resources subcommittee has tentatively scheduled legislative hearings on the refuge question for three days early in June.

<HEAD>President Worried About Nuclear Weapons Treaty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is voicing fear that <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> failure to approve a nuclear missile treaty quickly will `` put a strain'' on his summit next month with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Answering questions from an audience in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also sought Thursday to lower expectations that the superpowers will agree soon on an accord to slash their arsenals of intercontinental ballistic missiles. During a speech which White House officials said would outline some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objectives at the May 29-June 2 summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said relations between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have reached `` a period of realistic engagement.'' The president said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has achieved some successes in recent dealings with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> policy toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has placed more emphasis on preaching the gospel of freedom around the world _ rather than merely seeking to contain communist expansionism. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> was the second of its kind in recent weeks as he and his aides prepare for the coming summit. Asked by a law student to describe what would happen if the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty is not ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by the time the summit arrives, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I think it would be very upsetting and it would put a strain on the summit.'' `` We hope and pray that they will -LRB- approve the pact -RRB-, but the scheduling of it has been such that I am very concerned we may have to go without having it ratified,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> got little comfort on that score Thursday, as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, declared, `` I am not going to rush to judgment <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will not speed through the ratification debate, scheduled to start May 9. `` We want a good treaty, that is our objective,'' the senator said, adding that the White House-requested summit deadline for ratification `` does n't guide me at all.'' Several senators have expressed concern that provisions of the INF treaty may ban development of futuristic weapons. En route to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` we'll be working with the Hill'' on this problem. But he also said `` it would be a shame if it did not happen. We think we can overcome any obstacles. But there are still hurdles to be crossed.'' In response to another question during the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> outing, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> acknowledged that `` there's a great question'' about whether a treaty banning up to 50 percent of long-range nuclear missiles can be ready for signing during the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. But he said that `` we do n't want a fast treaty. We want a good treaty. We have never set a deadline'' for agreement on the strategic arms reduction pact -LRB- START -RRB-.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> apparently sought to lower expectations about an agreement on a START pact. He said that as part of the U.S.-Soviet agenda, arms control is `` not sturdy enough to bear up the whole platform of Soviet-American relations.'' Because of this, the president said, he will focus on a variety of issues in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, including regional disputes in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and elsewhere, as well as human rights and bilateral relations. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that while much headway has been made in relations between the superpowers, he remains wary of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s intentions. The president said, for instance, he's not sure of the genuineness of the Soviet agreement to withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` Let me say here that the next few months will be no time for complacency, no time to sit back and congratulate ourselves,'' he said. `` The Soviets have rarely before, and not at all in more than three decades, left a country once occupied. They have often promised to leave, but rarely in their history, and then only under pressure from the West, have they actually done it.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is closing fast on the number of delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination and could top that level within the next few days _ which would be even sooner than his advisers had expected. According to delegate counts maintained by both the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, the vice president seems almost certain to have the necessary delegates by next Tuesday after the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary. That's a week earlier than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials previously had anticiated. The campaign had not expected to reach the level until May 3, after primaries in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` We're in neutral as to when the date is; we'll take it when it comes,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a campaign official. The vice president's only remaining <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opposition is former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who has ceased active campaigning. According to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> count, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had 1,058 delegates as of Thursday while <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had a scant 17. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own count puts him at 1,066 right now. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could actually top the threshold before the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary, at which 78 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates will be selected. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Republicans were selecting 15 delegates this week. A <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> state GOP convention on Saturday will choose another 20. In addition, there currently are 45 `` loose'' delegates, ones chosen as uncommitted or whose candidates have dropped out of the race, leaving them free to recommit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is widely expected to pick up most of these delegates. `` We did gear up for May 3, and now it's coming before then,'' said a campaign official who declined to be identified by name. `` It's not as if we were planning to have a parade. But we had been looking at some different things to do.'' <PERSON> Top </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides met on Thursday to discuss the likelihood that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would go over the top earlier than expected and to make plans for how to greet the development, campaign sources said. One problem is that <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s primary selects `` blind'' delegates _ individuals by name, without reference to which candidate they support. `` I would rather err on the side of waiting than have anyone accuse us of jumping the gun,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. However, he added, `` We feel confident we'll be right around that number -LRB- needed to nominate -RRB- right after <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who has remained nominally neutral in the race until now, is expected to lend campaign support to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once the vice president is actually over the top, campaign aides have said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says that the timing of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> assistance is not important. `` There's no question of where the president is gong to be when this election comes forward,'' he said earlier this week. `` So I do n't feel under any pressure on this.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has had a virtual lock on the nomination since his last major rival, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, withdrew from the race on March 29 and released his delegates.

 Oscar-winning screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond, who won the Academy Award in 1960 for writing `` The Apartment,'' died Thursday of cancer. He was 67. Diamond, a longtime collaborator of director <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, also wrote such film classics as `` Some Like it Hot'' and `` <PERSON> Irma </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Douce </PERSON>.'' He died at his <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home. Diamond's work with <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> included `` Love in the Afternoon,'' `` Some Like It Hot,'' `` The Apartment'' and `` The Fortune Cookie.'' `` If I ever lost this guy, I'd feel like <ORGANIZATION> Abercrombie </ORGANIZATION> without <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON>,'' Mr. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> once said. <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> brought Diamond to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in 1940 after he studied at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where he distiguished himself by writing four consecutive student showcase reviews. Born Itek Dommnici in <LOCATION> Ungheni </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, on June 27, 1920, <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> took on the initials I.A.L. as a whim. They stood for nothing in particular. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said he became aware of Diamond's talent and approached the writer's then-agent, super agent <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> `` Swifty'' <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON>. The meeting resulted in the first of the classic Diamond-Wilder comedies, 1957's `` Love in the Afternoon,'' starring <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> confirmed Thursday that the writer had cancer for several months. `` He was a marvelous writer,'' <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> said Thursday night in a telephone interview. `` I introduced him to <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>. `` They collaborated for about 30 years,'' <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> remarked, adding that he represented Diamond for about 25 years. `` He was a very talented man, highly respected. ... He reached his greatest success with <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>.'' Comedies that <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> worked on had zany and sometimes dark humor. Together, they devised the teaming of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> in 1959's `` Some Like it Hot'' about a pair of road musicians hiding out from crooks by masquerading as members of an all-girl orchestra that included <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> in one of her most sweetly vulnerable roles. The script for which <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> won the Oscar was for `` The Apartment,'' a cynical comedy featuring <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> as a ladder-climbing clerk who rents his domicile to adulterous executives, one of whom was after his own girl.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is winning high marks among many of his fellow Democrats for taking `` the high road'' in refusing to be drawn into negative camaigning _ even while under siege from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> speaks frequently of party unity, accepting both his defeats and victories with grace, and tells his rivals not to attack one another but to focus on victory in November over the Republicans. His conduct during the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary race fit the pattern he has been carefully following, avoiding attacks on his rivals. When the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> race was over, he praised the campaign of the winner, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and called for a `` measure of cooperation'' as well as a `` measure of competition'' for the remainder of the campaign. The behavior has been noticed among leaders of his party, where once he was considered a divisive force. `` He's performed a kind of unifying and leading function throughout the campaign,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON>, who was manager of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> campaign before the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman dropped out of the race. `` I think Democrats all over the country are giving <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> high marks for his conduct during the campaign,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> has tried to keep to the high road. He has not been critical. It's been a deliberate conscious effort.'' The effort was apparent when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> held back from replying as <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who endorsed Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, tried to mix it up by calling <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> anti-Israel and accusing him of lying about his actions in the aftermath of the death of his mentor, Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. When asked by reporters to respond, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` Some people are making hysteria while I'm making history.'' `` While <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> was being a thug, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was being a diplomat,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, former campaign manager for the 1984 presidential campaign of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. `` The art of presidential politics has a very heavy dose of discipline, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has shown good deal of that.'' <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a prominent Democratic insider, both said many party officials have spoken well of the new <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` There's a real appreciation that he held back,'' in the face of <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s attacks, said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> said many at first were suspicious of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s motives, `` But I think he's made a believer out of a lot of people,'' and convinced them he is committed to a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told her more than a year ago that he had decided to wage a positive campaign, after a 1984 race in which he attacked Democratic party rules as exclusionary, alienated Jewish voters and fought for the spotlight by traveling abroad to meet with controversial figures including <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. `` In his earlier years he obviously was a protester,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, former adviser to President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` This time he has grown tremendously and has grown into the protecter of the high road.'' In the campaign debates, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has relished the role of the conciliator while his rivals squabbled, urging them to save their fire for the Republicans. While aiming at installing a Democratic administration in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also is angling to make himself a party insider rather than the outsider he was in 1984, observers agree. Not only does <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> refrain from attacking his opponents, he regularly telephones them and has developed `` a kind of camaraderie,'' said his campaign manager, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>. He has pledged he will campaign for the Democratic ticket even if he is not on it. Such action should help consolidate his role in future party politics. <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> said, `` I fully expect him to run for president again.'' And <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON> commented, `` He's doing all the right things for his future.'' <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, at 46, is `` going to be around for a long time.''

<TEXT>
 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> and the union representing 40,000 airline pilots are trading sharp words over the usefulness of the union's recently concluded postcard safety campaign at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION> on Thursday accused the pilots of throwing around unsubstantiated allegations that `` gum up the system'' and prevent <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> inspectors from pursuing other serious safety problems. A day earlier <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, accused <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> of unfair `` public carping'' about the union's campaign, in which more than a thousand postcards about alleged safety defects were sent to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The brouhaha began last weekend when <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said on national television that while the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has been involved in various investigations into <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s safety practices, the allegations raised by the pilots had been of little help because they did not contain enough specifics. Of 1,300 postcards complaining about safety problems at Eastern only six could be substantiated by <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> authorities, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said. The Miami-based carrier is the subject of a plane-by-plane safety review by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and faces a possible $ 823,000 civil fine because of past safety violations. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> accused <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> in a letter of not understanding the purpose of the postcard campaign. `` I am at a loss as to why you repeatedly engage in public carping against the postcard campaign to the point of mischaracterizing it and misleading the public,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> wrote <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION>. During a meeting with reporters Thursday, <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION> repeated his criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> effort, but said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> nevertheless tried to look into each of the 1,300 complaints. `` It is a diversion of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> resources and sends our people on a wild goose chase when they could be doing serious inspections -LRB- and -RRB- investigating claims of safety problems that are documented,'' said <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION>. `` It is at bottom an anti-safety device.'' `` Complaints that are groundless ... gum up the system,'' he continued. `` They would serve safety better if they sent us serious complaints,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said of the 40,000-member pilots union. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON> said the union would have no further comment on <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION>'s remarks, referring instead to <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>'s letter Wednesday to <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION> which the union released previously. In the letter, <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said most of the postcards about alleged problems at Eastern were sent anonymously and lacked some details because the pilots feared reprisals if more information were provided. `` If Eastern were to agree to ... no reprisals against employees wishing to report safety problems, your desk would be flooded with safety reports, complete down to the most minute detail of name, time, place and aircraft number,'' wrote <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said the department would take action against any airline found taking punitive action against an employee who discloses a safety problem. Eastern management has accused the pilots of a `` slanderous safety campaign'' and denied safety problems at the airline.

<HEAD>Official Says US-Canada Agricultural Trade Chock Full Of
Opportunities</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 High-value products from soup to nuts dominate a thriving agricultural export business with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says there is excellent potential for further growth. `` Trade between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is smoothed because the two countries share a common language as well as great similarities in customs and culture, socio-economic status, economic structure and consumer preferences,'' says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s 26 million people are the largest foreign market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high-value products, accounting for almost 20 percent of the total exports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> those items. More than 85 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ $ 1.81 billion last year _ are in the form of high-value products. By <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> definition, high-value products, or HVPs, are `` value-added processed products and consumer-ready products such as nuts, fresh fruits and vegetables.'' <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON>, in a report scheduled for the May issue of Foreign Agriculture magazine, said horticultural and tropical products make up the largest component of high-value trade with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, accounting for nearly 62 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high-value total. Fresh vegetables lead the list and have shown `` a slow but steady increase over the past several decades,'' he said. `` Prospects for this trend to continue are favorable.'' Dairy, livestock and poultry products make up the next largest HVP category, led by undressed fur skins. `` High-value grain and feed products, which have posted an annual growth rate of 8 percent since 1980, also show potential for further growth,'' <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> said. `` Leading product groups are starch-inulin-gluten products; prepared breakfast food; and bread, biscuits and cake.'' There is a potential also for fast foods such as frozen and microwavable products, and for foods with a short preparation time. `` Although the outlook for trade appears good, labeling requirements continue to present possible constraints,'' he said. `` Canada uses the metric system, and metric weights and measures must be stated on the labels of all prepackaged consumer products.'' For example, sliced bacon must be marketed in 500-gram packages. One-pound packages _ 454 grams _ are not allowed. `` Bilingual labeling is required for almost all consumer food products entering <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> said. `` French is one of the two official languages in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and is the principal language in many of the large urban areas of eastern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.'' The new U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement `` is expected to open the doors to wider markets on both sides of the border,'' he said. `` If the pact is approved by both nations, all tariff and some non-tariff barriers to agricultural trade will be eliminated over the next 10 years.'' But <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> said that even with the new trade pact some constraints will exist, particularly for high-value products. For example, although discriminatory price markups on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wines will be eliminated, the sale of alcoholic beverages will remain under the control of the sovereign provincial monopolies, he said. Each of those boards has its own set of rules and regulations that affect liquor products sold in their jurisdictions. Also, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fresh fruits and vegetables could continue to face seasonal restrictions because of a `` snapback'' provision in the pact which allows either country to apply tariffs for up to 180 days a year under certain price and production conditions, <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> removed some of the red tape hampering shipment of certain genetically engineered organisms from one state to another.

The exempted laboratory microorganisms were Escherichia coli genotype K-12 and its derivatives, sterile strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or asporogenic -LRB- non-spore forming -RRB- strains of Bacillus subtilis. The microorganisms being exempted are not only non-toxic but can not survive outside of carefully controlled laboratory conditions, <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said.

 There were fewer hens in the nation's egg-laying flocks last month, but they worked harder than they did a year ago, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> shows Production was estimated 5.96 billion eggs in March, a 1 percent decline from a year earlier, the report said Thursday. But the total number of hens averaged 278 million last month, a 2 percent decline from March 1987. That put March egg output at an average of 2,147 eggs per 100 layers, compared with 2,132 eggs from 100 birds a year earlier, the report said.

 Eight in 10 American smokers believe that `` passive'' cigarette smoke is harmful, and nearly half say they've found others' smoke to be annoying, according to a government survey Eighty-eight percent of the Americans over 16 who were questioned in the federal government's 1986 tobacco-use surveys said they considered smoke from the cigarettes of others to be generally harmful to health, the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The survey also found that 79 percent of all respondents _ including 43 percent of smokers _ said they were annoyed by others' cigarette smoke And 61 percent of all respondents _ including 14 percent of the smokers _ said that, when given a choice, they sit in the non-smoking sections of restaurants, airplanes and other public places. `` These data indicate that a large percentage of smokers and non-smokers regard -LRB- passive smoking -RRB- as a health hazard,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its report. `` In addition, a majority of non-smokers and almost half of current smokers are annoyed. ...'' The survey, among 13,031 people, was conducted before Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s landmark report warning of the effects of passive smoking was released at the end of 1986. If it were repeated, the awareness and distaste for passive smoking would probably be even higher, said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Novotny </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> on Smoking and Health, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> department that conducted the survey. The survey's margin of sampling error is believed to be no more than 2 percentage points, <PERSON> Novotny </PERSON> said. The findings were up noticeably from a poll conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in 1978, which found that 58 percent of Americans believed passive smoking was hazardous, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> noted. Other findings from the government's 1986 survey: _ 82 percent of those who never smoked pick no-smoking sections in planes and restaurants, compared with 69 percent of former smokers _ 75 percent of smokers said passive smoke was `` very'' or `` somewhat'' harmful, rather than `` slightly'' or not at all _ 69 percent of those who never smoked or had quit said passive smoking was harmful to their own health, not just in general _ 42 percent of all working respondents said their workplaces have restricted smoking, and 53 percent of them said they were nonetheless still exposed to passive smoking in the workplace

 Tennis star <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> has moved a giant step closer to his dream of playing for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic team in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> this summer, winning a crucial set from a skeptical <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The House Judiciary immigration subcommittee, which last year vowed to avoid speeding up grants of citizenship to athletes hoping to compete in the Olympics, did just that Thursday for <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> and two lesser-known hopefuls. <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> wants <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to lift the mandatory five-year waiting period immigrants with permanent resident status must go through before receiving full citizenship. The Czech native, who lives in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and has adopted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as his home, can not represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the Olympics without citizenship. `` <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> deserves the opportunity to compete as a citizen of his adopted country, and we as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens deserve to have him represent us,'' Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., told the panel <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> is ranked No. 1 in the world. Rep. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON>, D-Ky., the subcommittee chairman, usually opposes such bills But he said he was sympathetic to arguments that preventing <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON>'s participation would be a `` true hardship'' because his prime years are so limited. Still, <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON> said he was concerned that expedited citizenship would not automatically make <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> eligible for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said that under <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> rules, a player first must represent his country in the Davis Cup before the Olympics. But federation rules also say that <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> needs a special waiver to play for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the Davis Cup since he has previously represented his native <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in those games. The next Davis Cup is in July. The Olympics, which will be held in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> from Sept. 17 through Oct. 2, will have tennis as a full sport for the first time since 1924. It was a trial sport in 1984. Modified Olympic rules will allow professional tennis players such as <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> to compete. The <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> bill, which even proponents had given little chance of passage earlier this year, was approved without opposition and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The subcommittee also approved citizenship bills for <PERSON> Jens-Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Burntd </PERSON>, an East German swimmer who defected in 1985 and is living in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Gagik </PERSON> <PERSON> Barseghian </PERSON>, an Armenian wrestler who moved to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1986.

<HEAD>New Flu Vaccine On Way After `Drift' In Viruses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A `` drift'' in the prevailing influenza viruses circulating over the winter has prompted federal health officials to recommend changes in next winter's flu vaccine. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> called Thursday for an alteration in the nation's recommended flu vaccine, to better protect against two viruses that `` drifted,'' or began changing into different forms in the 1987-88 flu season. The 1987-88 flu vaccine, as is customary, contained protection against the three major types of flu _ which researchers know as Type A-H3N2, Type A-H1N1, and Type B. Specifically, the vaccine was tailored to guard against an A-H3N2 strain known as the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> flu, an A-H1N1 strain known as the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> flu and a B strain known as the <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> flu. But late last year, as the winter flu season began in this country and the vaccine was administered, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> researchers reported evidence of a `` drift'' in the A-H3N2 virus, toward a different form. Researchers later said they had identified four A-H3N2 strains circulating in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. One of those four strains, known as the <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> flu, should be included in the 1988-89 flu vaccine, the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> recommended in Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> weekly report. Meanwhile, although Type B flu was seen less frequently than Type A-H3N2 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last winter, `` it has become clear'' that a `` drift'' in that flu, too, has occurred. The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is thus recommending a different B strain, the <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> flu, be included in next winter's vaccine. For its third component, the vaccine should again include last year's recommended A-H1N1 strain, the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> flu, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researchers say such variations in flu viruses are not uncommon. The agency recommends flu vaccine particularly for older people and those who might be prone to severe complications from the flu. There are indications that the 1987-88 flu season continues to wind down, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Only two states _ <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> _ last week reported `` widespread'' outbreaks of flu-like illness, with reports from areas containing at least half the state's population Five others _ <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> _ reported less severe, `` regional'' outbreaks, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. To gauge the effects of the flu season, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researchers measure the number of deaths from pneumonia and flu in selected cities against the standard for the time of year; that index has been above the `` epidemic threshold'' for nine weeks, said Dr. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaventa </PERSON>, a CDC flu specialist.

 States must provide new programs for blue-collar workers in computer and math, broadening old notions of literacy to ensure workers can compete in an increasingly technological economy, says a report by the state of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Economic change has redefined literacy,'' <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said Thursday at a news conference releasing the report. For example, he said, workers in auto plants and other factories must be able to understand computer manuals and perform other tasks far removed from traditional jobs such as putting a nut on a bolt. The report said reading and writing are no longer sufficient skills for a worker to get a job, and it proposed programs that any state could use to develop the math, computer and teamwork skills of workers. The report also recommended creation of standard ways to assess worker skills, coordinate training programs and make access to such training programs easier. Fully 15 percent to 20 percent of adults in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lack the skills needed to get and keep jobs, <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, as many as 1.3 million adults lack the skills needed to work in the new economy, he said. The report said 30 percent of new jobs created in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> by the end of the century will require at least four years of college, a level of education attained by only 17 percent of the workers in the state. The report said 22 percent of new jobs will require from one to three years of college, a level reached by only 20 percent of the workers in the state. At the other end of the scale, the 40 percent of the workers having only a high school education will be competing for 34 percent of the jobs, and the 16 percent that dropped out of high school will be competing for 10 percent of the jobs. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> plan would require little new money and would largely draw on the $ 500 million a year now spent for training and retraining, <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said.

Accompanied by <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> toured a neighborhood known for its drug sales to spread his trademark `` down with dope, up with hope'' message. `` We've got to change our minds about drugs, the No. 1 threat to our national security,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a cheering crowd. `` When I become president the drug pusher is in trouble.'' <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, hoarse from shouting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s name as he walked arm-in-arm with the candidate, told the crowd, `` We're here to send <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and we need you to turn out and vote next Tuesday.''

<HEAD>More Health Workers' AIDS From `Unknown' Cause; Feds Say Risk
Still Low</HEAD>

 The occupational hazard of AIDS in health care workers remains small, although there are more unexplained cases among those workers than among other Americans, government health researchers say. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that 2,586 health care workers are known to be among the more than 50,000 Americans who have contracted AIDS. While only 2.8 percent of the nation's other AIDS patients are classified as having gotten the disease in an `` undetermined'' manner, nearly twice as many of the health care workers with AIDS are so characterized _ 5.3 percent, or 135 in all, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Health care workers make up 5.4 percent of the known <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> AIDS patients and a similar percentage of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population at large _ 5.7 percent. More than a dozen health care workers are documented to have been infected with the virus that causes AIDS as a result of their work _ usually by being pricked accidentally by a needle carrying contaminated blood. One health care worker is known to have gone on to develop the deadly disease itself after he was infected in such a manner. Scientific studies in which health workers are enrolled and then followed to assess their risk of AIDS infection have shown that the chance of being infected after a needle-stick exposure to blood from infected patients is less than 1 percent, the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` That data has not changed at all -LRB- in continuing studies -RRB-,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberland </PERSON>, a CDC AIDS specialist `` The risk is still regarded as low.'' The reasons for the higher number of undetermined cases among health care workers could include patients' failure to report homosexual activity, drug use and other risk factors, or `` the occupational risk of -LRB- AIDS -RRB- infection as a result of blood exposure, or both,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome most often strikes homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers, and also is spread less frequently through heterosexual contact or blood transfusions. The failure of AIDS patients to disclose behavior that might have put them at risk is something researchers consider when looking at undetermined risk, Ms. <PERSON> Chamberland </PERSON> said. `` Or, we may be seeing some occupational transmission in the health care setting,'' she added. `` It's difficult to establish with certainty how transmission occurred.'' While most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health care workers with AIDS were infected outside their jobs, `` a small number of health-care workers have been infected ... through occupational exposures,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> noted in its weekly report. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, has struck 59,491 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and has so far killed 33,280 of them, according to statistics this week from the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s newly-prosperous trading countries dislike being lumped together, but growing interdependence means they and other Pacific rim nations should organize a regional economic framework, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was told. `` The entire <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region now requires a mechanism for multilateral economic consultations -LRB- because it -RRB- ... has become one of the most interdependent areas of the world and in the next century will have the largest impact of any region on the global economy,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION>. Fairbanks' group is an organization of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, business and academic specialists on trade, focusing on <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> issues. Pacific trade tensions are managed `` primarily by means of a growing tangle of bilateral dialogues whose inefficiencies have begun to work against us,'' <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> said Thursday.

All four have large trade surpluses with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. For example, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, `` as a key political and military ally of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, would be more willing to rapidly revalue -LRB- appreciate -RRB- its currency and liberalize imports if it could be more certain that such measures would benefit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' Fairbanks said.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, paid $ 86,684 in 1987 income taxes, slightly more than the amount paid by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. However, the Bushes paid the taxes on $ 36,963 less income. According to tax return released Wednesday, <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> paid taxes equivalent to 28 percent of their total income of $ 308,396. By contrast, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 86,638 in taxes on total income of $ 345,349, or 25 percent. Both the president and the man who will be the 1988 Republican presidential nominee benefited under new tax-law changes, although <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> clearly benefited the most. In 1986, the Bushes had paid taxes of $ 115,486 on income of $ 348,594 _ or 33 percent. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1986 tax bill came to $ 92,460 on total income of $ 336,649 _ or 27.5 percent. The bulk of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s income came from his $ 114,681 in salary plus other reimbursements as vice president and from $ 169,600 from the blind trust set up when he took office in 1981. This trust included $ 26,075 in capital gains, $ 31,264 in interest and dividends and $ 112,261 in other income. Details were not disclosed under terms of the blind trust. Aides have said previously that the trust is valued at about $ 1 million. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also reported $ 20,773 in `` passive income'' from his interest in a liquefied natural gas barge, $ 1,575 in royalties on his book, `` Looking Forward,'' and $ 66 in interest on his account in the White House credit union. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s salary was up from the $ 97,900 he received in 1986, reflecting a general raise in federal salaries, even though his overall income was down. The main reason for the lower gross income: a much lower level of capital gains, the income derived from the sale of assets, property or stock. In 1986, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reported total capital gains of $ 430,165, apparently reflecting a decision by the trustees of his blind trust to sell off assets before the new tax-law changes took effect last Jan. 1, which increased the tax on capital gains to 28 percent for 1987. Before then, not all capital gains were reported as income. This resulted in a maximum total tax of 20 percent on such gains. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made return to a lower rate of taxation on capital gains a major campaign theme, claiming the decision to tax capital gains at generally the same rate as other earnings stifles business investment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed a capital gains tax of no more than 15 percent. The Bushes claimed total deductions for 1987 of $ 53,314, including $ 12,225 in contributions to 35 charities. The largest were three $ 1,000 gifts to the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and to the Combined Federal Campaign -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> in 1948. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had $ 32,588 withheld from his salary and made an additonal $ 57,000 in advance payments _ suggesting a refund of $ 2,904. However, the vice president elected to have this money held and applied to his 1988 taxes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claimed $ 3,574 in business meals and entertainment and another $ 6,880 in miscellaneous business deductions. He paid $ 700 to have the tax return prepared by a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> accounting firm. The vice president has released his tax returns annually. In addition, he released 14 years in previous returns last January during the heat of his campaign with then-rival Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who has since withdrawn from the race for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination. Those returns showed that 1986 was _ and still is _ his biggest income year, and that over the 14-year period he paid taxes ranging from 3 percent to 41 percent of his annual income. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimates that by next year, when the tax-law changes are fully phased in, about three-quarters of all Americans will have smaller proportional tax bills than they had in 1986.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> joked about books by ex-aides and his own mental faculties, but grew serious in his farewell to the White House press corps when he turned to his seven years of `` friction'' with the media. `` What I hope my epitaph will be with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> correspondents, what every president's epitaph should be, is ` he gave as good as he got,''' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> dinner on Thursday. `` That, I think, makes for a healthy press and a healthy presidency,'' he said in his seventh and last appearance at the dinner, an annual affair where reporters and public officials set aside hostilities for a night and toast each other alongside invited celebrities. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, seated beside him, also noted the furor over recent critical books by longtime aides such as former presidential spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> and former deputy White House chief of staff <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>. `` This looks like the index to <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> book,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, as he looked out over the crowd. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> had accepted an invitation to the dinner from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, but withdrew last week in the wake of stories about his book. `` Even -LRB- White House chief of staff -RRB- <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is writing a book. It's going to be called ` Three By Five: The Measure of a President,''' he said, referring to his use of index cards in meetings. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> said I have a short attention span,'' he said. `` I was going to reply to that, but what the hell, let's move on to something else.'' And joking about the frequent complaints that he does not hold enough meetings with the press, he said the presidential campaign has left him `` feeling a little lonely.'' `` With everyone following the presidential campaign, I've been feeling a little bit lonely. I've been so desperate for attention, I almost considered holding a news conference,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, drawing his biggest laugh from the reporters. He got a more sober reaction when he noted the media criticism of his administration. `` Every president will try to use the press to his best advantage,'' he said. But `` the press is not a weak sister that needs bracing. The press can take care of itself and a president should be able to take care of himself as well.'' In keeping with the cease-fire spirit of the evening, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> applauded and shook hands with seven reporters who got awards for White House coverage that included several articles about problems in his administration in the past year. The reporters used the evening to issue their traditional invitations to celebrities from motion pictures and supermarket tabloids, causing problems when photographers shoved past members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members to get pictures. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, a guest of The <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>, posed quietly as dozens of people took photographs and asked for her autograph. Former presidential candidate <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, whose association with Ms. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> helped end his campaign, did not attend. <PERSON> Vanna </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> came with <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> and sat on his lap during the dessert course. <PERSON> Fawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secretary, was there talking with former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, the special prosecutor of the Iran-Contra affair, sat nearby.

 Indictments against 10 men will not repair the shattered life of a 19-year-old woman who remains in hiding with her family since she reported being abducted and gang-raped last month, friends say. `` They have to get out of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaeger </PERSON>, a friend of the victim and her 23-year-old husband in this southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town of 5,000, where many residents are related. `` They'll never be able to come back here. A grand jury indicted 10 men Thursday on charges including sexual assault and aggravated kidnapping. The couple and their two children, ages 16 months and four months, have lived in a secret location in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> since shortly after she reported the March 26 incident, <ORGANIZATION> Yaeger </ORGANIZATION> said. Some of the defendants have said the victim was a willing participant, and <PERSON> Yaeger </PERSON> said the victim and her family have received threats for reporting the incident to authorities. The young mother returned to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to testify before the grand jury Thursday, and was led out of the courthouse with her head and face covered by a black shawl. The woman said the four-hour series of assaults began at an illegal cockfight at a ranch and continued at two other locations. Bystanders ignored her pleas for help and some joined her attackers, she said. Since news of the incident, however, well-wishers donated more than $ 8,000 to the family, and the unemployed husband received a job offer, said <PERSON> Dot </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnette </PERSON> of Crisis Services in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. `` I would say that the response from the community has been fantastic, particularly with individuals,'' Ms. <PERSON> Barnette </PERSON> said. The 10 men who were indicted were arrested within days of the attack, and will be re-arrested, said <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Duval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> assistant district attorney. Bonds for each sexual assault charge were set at $ 50,000; bonds for each kidnapping charge were set at $ 100,000.

<TEXT>
 A poem by anyone other than <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> might not scan as sweet. But scholars are turning up their noses at reports of previously unpublished verse by the Bard in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> library. The poem, pasted onto the back of a manuscript volume in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION> here, was discovered in December 1986 by an <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researcher and published for the first time today in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper The Independent. `` It's possible, certainly,'' said <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodson </PERSON>, associate curator of literary manuscripts at the library, one of the most prestigious in the West. `` But then again, we will want to wait and see the evidence on which the attribution is being made.'' The researcher, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, came across the 14-verse poem while working on a biography of the 16th - and early 17th-century poet and playwright, The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> reported Thursday <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> brooded on his find for a year, told his British publishers, <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, and showed the verses to colleagues, according to The Independent. But the report by the paper's literary editor, <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulks </PERSON>, said the decision to attribute the verses to <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> was <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s own It quoted him as saying: `` I have thought about these lines for a long time and I do n't see how they can not be by <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s chairman, Lord <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, `` <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> has to his satisfaction and I think to the satisfaction of a lot of other people _ and certainly to us _ authenticated this as poetry penned by ` Big Bill'.'' However, <PERSON> Faulks </PERSON> said <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> was `` not absolutely certain'' that <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> wrote the poem. The 14 short verses were intended to be spoken at a betrothal party for <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, the eldest daughter of the Dowager <PERSON> Countess </PERSON> <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION>, The Independent said. The name of the planned speaker was written before each verse, and <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> is believed to have used the names as keys in his literary detective work, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> will hold a news conference in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Monday, but declined comment on what will be revealed. Repeated calls by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Stonesfield </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> went unanswered. However, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, professor of Shakespeare studies at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as telling the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> that scholars who have examined the poem had `` little doubt that these verses were written not by <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> but by someone else.'' <PERSON> Hallett </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, senior research associate at the library, also said it was unlikely the work was written by <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who had not studied the disputed poem, said no significant Shakespearean literary creations have ever been uncovered apart from the main body of his work. Ms. <PERSON> Hodson </PERSON> added that this is n't the first time someone has suggested that the work might have been written by <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>. `` It has been in the library since 1917 and looked at by many scholars in all those years,'' she said. `` At least one other scholar and probably more have wondered about the <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> connection.'' It is difficult to decipher the contents of the poem because it is scrawled in poor handwriting, Ms. <PERSON> Hodson </PERSON> said. There are initials at the bottom that could either be interpreted as `` WSH'' or `` WSK.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> said the poem will be published Monday in a 28-page booklet produced in secrecy by <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>, `` A Private Commission: New Verse by <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, `` two days after the 424th anniversary of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s birth. In 1985, a love poem found in <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s Bodleian Library and attributed to <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> by American scholar <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> drew bad marks from other scholars, who said it could not have been <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s work. Ms. <PERSON> Hodson </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> poem is written on two sheets of paper pasted inside the back cover of a manuscript volume containing a play by English dramatist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marston </PERSON>, who lived from 1575 to 1634. <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> lived from about 1564 to 1616. Neither the <PERSON> Marston </PERSON> play nor the poem attributed to <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> is marked with a date, but handwriting, paper, watermarks and the binding have been used to date the manuscripts to the 17th century, Ms. <PERSON> Hodson </PERSON> explained. The Huntington collection has 2.5 million manuscripts including several of the most important manuscripts by <PERSON> Chaucer </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Hodson </PERSON> said.

 A mother distraught over a difficult pregnancy `` just snapped'' when she drowned her 2-month-old son in the bathtub to stop his crying, then reported him kidnapped from his stroller, police said. <PERSON> Lucrezia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, 36, was charged with second-degree murder late Thursday night, said police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. The infant <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, dressed in a blue hooded snowsuit, was found dead in a trash can Thursday after his mother broke down during a polygraph test at <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, told detectives about her son's death and gave them the location of his body. `` I put him under the water until he stopped crying,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> told detectives, said a police source close to the investigation, who insisted on anonymity. Investigators say she drowned the infant at her <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> apartment Wednesday morning. Her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, 32, also was questioned but was cleared of any involvement in his son's death <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, who had retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> police force with a disability in 1984, had worked part-time as a guard for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal's office in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> was alone when the baby died. `` She then dressed the baby, placed him in a white plastic bag, put him in his stroller, walked several blocks ... and placed the baby in a green trash can,'' said Chief of Detectives <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON> during a news conference at police headquarters Thursday. Initially, Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> had told police <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> was taken from his stroller by two men in a black sedan who stopped her to ask directions as she was walking towards St. <PERSON> Ephram </PERSON>'s grammar school Wednesday morning. She said a woman had phoned the <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> home to say Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>'s 7-year-old son, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, was ill at the school. The police found no evidence of the call. Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> did not have a history of mental problems, <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON> said. There was also no indication of child abuse and no record of reports to city agencies indicating they had been notified of any abuse, the chief said. The baby `` was colicky and she had post-partum depression,'' said the police source. `` She had a difficult pregnancy, a difficult birth, the kid was up all night and she could n't sleep. She just snapped,'' the source said. Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>'s unhappiness with her second pregnancy, which ended with a delivert by Caesarian section, was corroborated by neighbors. A downstairs neighbor, who asked that her name not be used, described the Gentiles as a couple who kept to themselves and were known to argue frequently. `` They just bought a house. They're supposed to be a typical American family, moving to <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> with the two kids,'' the neighbor said. After she brought the baby home, Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> had complained about the baby's colic, a condition which makes infants cry for prolonged periods of time.

 Gunmen eluded a huge police manhunt early today after fleeing his resort town with three hostages following a botched robbery and 24-hour siege in which five people were killed and 42 held captive. All hostages were later freed. Unconfirmed local press reports said the robbers took about $ 13,000 in bank money. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, a policeman participating in the hunt, confirmed some money was taken but declined to say how much. About 500 police and army personnel backed by a helicopter searched for the seven young men Thursday night and police set up blockades on highways leading out of the city. `` The gunmen must have gone to the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION>, where it will be difficult to locate them,'' said <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, referring to the nearby <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madre </LOCATION> mountain range. The gunmen had holed up inside the local offices of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> after the foiled robbery. They let their 42 hostages go Thursday and were permitted to flee in an armored car with three <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers. Police said the robbers released the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers 15 minutes later, when they abandoned the armored car at a gas station and took off in a stolen pickup truck and station wagon. One of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers, <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Angulo </PERSON>, said there were only five gunmen in the armored car, which he was forced to drive. <PERSON> Angulo </PERSON> said one of his captors had an arm wound. `` I think the other two mixed in among the crowd at the moment of leaving the bank,'' he said. Most police officers had withdrawn from around the bank just before the seven men left, apparently as part of an agreement ending the standoff. <PERSON> Angulo </PERSON> said the robbers strapped sticks of dynamite to their bodies and toted sawed-off machine guns. He said the men were calm. <PERSON> Angulo </PERSON> and the other two <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> hostages were unhurt. Mexican authorities routinely patrol the rugged <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madre </ORGANIZATION> in search of marijuana and opium poppy plantations and clandestine airstrips used by drug traffickers. Gov. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Labastida </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> state told the <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION> TV network Thursday that the release agreement allowed police to pursue the gunmen. `` We're not deceiving anyone,'' the governor said. `` We simply reached an agreement in which we could safeguard lives.'' <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, a spokesman for the governor, said the gunmen demanded earlier that they be allowed to leave by air. Police said the robbers were in their late teens or early 20s and had no political motives. The standoff in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mochis </LOCATION>, a town of 120,000 on the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> about 500 miles south of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, began at 12:45 p.m. Wednesday when the gunmen took hostages after an alarm alerted police there was a robbery in progress. Red Cross spokesmen said five people were killed and at least 15 wounded during the attempted robbery and ensuing siege after hundreds of police surrounded the bank. Spokesman <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON> of the local <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said one of its rescue workers was among those killed in a gunfight Wednesday between police and the robbers. He said the others slain were a customer, bank official and teller, and a policeman who was in the bank on business at the time of the robbery and tried to prevent it. The wife of one hostage said her husband, farmworker <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Terraza </PERSON>, 29, was seriously wounded during the gunfight and was in grave condition at a local hospital. `` He only wanted to cash a check'' inside the bank, she said. Bank robberies and other kinds of crime have increased significantly in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since 1982, when an economic crisis began to eat away purchasing power and drive up unemployment. <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> is known as a center for crime, especially of the type linked to the illegal drug trade.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may have overreacted by attacking Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for mines laid in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` We may have shot ourselves in the foot,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>. `` There is good reason to suspect that the mines that prompted Monday's retaliation were not laid by <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> authorities, but by some Iranian radicals looking to start a fight. `` Our restrained policy in the gulf worked superbly until now,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said in remarks prepared for delivery today. `` We had shown sufficient force to convince <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to back off, without reacting so bloodily as to generate the ` martyrs' that the -LRB- Iranian -RRB- radicals use to inflame public passions,'' he said. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is headed for another fight over invoking the War Powers Act for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> policy, but even a prime supporter says he's unsure of what the effort will accomplish. `` I'm not sure it will do any good,'' Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., said Thursday But <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he plans to push anyway for invoking the 1973 law because it is on the books and thus should be followed. `` The consequences of selective observance of the law are truly frightening,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who tried unsuccessfully for two months last year to win <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval of a War Powers resolution. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> also says he plans to introduce a bill authorizing the continued deployment of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` I am not trying to force the withdrawal of American forces,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. `` We have a right to be there and have a mission to perform there.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he wants <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take a stand on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 10-month-old policy of reflagging 11 Kuwaiti tankers and protecting them with <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> convoys `` We are abrogating our obligation under the Constitution and we are abrogating our responsibility under the law,'' he said. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> has been one of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s strongest backers of invoking the War Powers Act, the Vietnam-era law limiting a president's authority to commit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel to situations of `` imminent danger. Under some circumstances, the law requires withdrawal of the troops after 60 days unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> votes to let them remain. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has asserted the measure is an unconstitutional limit on his authority and he has refused to trigger its provisions for his gulf policy. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s remarks were his first major comment on Monday's clashes in which <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships destroyed two Iranian oil platforms in the southern gulf. Afterward, Iranian ships attacked <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> forces and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> responded by sinking or damaging six Iranian ships. Administration officials said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strikes at the platforms were retaliation for last week's mining of the frigate USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. Ten sailors were injured and the ship was nearly sunk when the vessel hit a mine the administration said was laid by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s regime `` re-evaluated its <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> policy in January'' and decided not to confront the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> any more. `` There is good reason to suspect that some irate -LRB- Iranian -RRB- radicals decided to light a fire in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>,'' he said. He said `` it would not take more than a handful of Revolutionary Guards to drop some mines in the gulf sea lanes'' and cause a `` return to the glorious confrontational days of yore.''

<HEAD>Nile Delta Slowly Eroding Into Sea, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sinking land and rising seas will cause Egyptian lands where more than a million people now live to be covered by water over the next century, a <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> researcher reports in a study published today. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, senior oceanographer at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION>, said in an article in Science that by the year 2100, the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> will cause major flooding of the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> delta land between <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Said </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Suez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Damietta </LOCATION> branch of the Nile `` The sea is cutting back the shoreline now at the rate of 50 to 100 feet a year in some areas,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>. `` The sea is acting like a saw and grinding away at the soils and sediments in the area.'' `` I see it as a very serious problem eventually,'' he added. Some dry land now more than 20 miles from the shoreline could be covered by up to three feet of sea water by the end of the next century, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said. Much of this land now is used to grow crops. The seawater invasion is being caused by the action of three forces, the scientist said. First is the rise of the sea itself. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said sea level is climbing in the northeastern Nile delta at the rate of about 1 -LCB- feet a century. The second factor is that the ground in the area is sinking at about the same rate. The third factor is the <LOCATION> Aswan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Based on corings of the sediment in the area, it appears the land subsidence and the rise in sea level rise have been under way for about 7,500 years in the Nile delta, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said. The loss in land was kept in check, however, by tons of sediment washed down the Nile River every year. The sediment collected along the shoreline, allowing the land to maintain its relative position to the sea. But in 1964, the <LOCATION> Aswan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION> on the Nile was closed and the sediment was blocked. Instead of being deposited on the shore, the sediment now is collecting in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nassar </LOCATION>, in back of the dam. Without this sediment, the shoreline of the delta began to wash away. `` On a year-to-year basis, the effects will only be marginally felt,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>. `` But over decades, you will see a changing position of the water level.'' He said the fresh ground water in the area is slowly being tainted by saline sea water. This, he said, could seriously affect Egyptian efforts to develop agriculture, irrigation and industry in the area. `` This is sort of the breadbasket of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>. `` The most serious ramifications are to the agriculture.'' About a million people now live in areas that will be flooded by the year 2100, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said. Port Said, a major city at the northern end of the <LOCATION> Suez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, is in the threatened area. So are important farming and industrial projects. The researcher said the canal itself probably will not be affected. Science is the journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>Mysterious Intruders Reportedly Penetrate U.S. Military
Installations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By REID G. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they are frustrated over their inability to catch the mysterious intruders who reportedly penetrated <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military installations near the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> twice this week. The incidents Tuesday and Wednesday nights brought to four the number of intrusions at American military facilities reported by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in the past two weeks. All were termed serious. Neither the Panamanian government nor the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> commented on this week's incidents. Last week they ridiculed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accounts of intrusions, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> apparently fired at `` swaying palm trees.'' The command said Thursday that no casualties were reported in the latest intrusions. It said that an Army patrol detonated two claymore mines to scare off one group of about 30 men and an Army sentry drew gunfire in another case. `` If we could get our hands on one of them, we'd know what we're dealing with It's frustrating,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ormsby </PERSON>, a civilian spokesman for the command. `` They are highly trained professionals who are trying to elicit a reaction through intimidation, through harassment,'' he added. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, suggested to reporters that the first intrusion on April 11 was carried out by Panamanian military personnel commanded by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s strongman, has headed the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> since 1983. He is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on drug trafficking charges. He has rejected the charges. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has sought his ouster for months, as has a growing internal opposition. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged Thursday they have no hard evidence to identify those intruders or the ones on April 12 or the latest two reported incidents. `` I would n't want to speculate that it's even the same people,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON>, another command spokesman. `` One thing we do know _ they're good, highly professional.'' A Marine was killed April 11 when fellow guards accidentally shot him while trying to surround what they described as a group of eight intruders at a fuel storage depot near <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. The next night, about 100 Marines said they exchanged small arms fire and fired three mortar rounds at intruders numbering from 40 to 50 at the same place, the 807-acre <ORGANIZATION> Arraijan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON> said that on Tuesday night a sentry tried to halt three men near a fence surrounding an Army munitions depot near the <LOCATION> Rodman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. He said one intruder fired a revolver at the guard, who returned fire and called for help. The intruder fired at least one more shot at the guard, then fled with his companions before a 12-man Marine Quick Reaction Team arrived, <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON> said. He said the gunman apparently crawled through a culvert under a security fence surrounding the ammunition dump while his two companions stayed on the other side. `` But all three were well inside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense territory,'' <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON> said. `` They were only about 75 meters away -LRB- nearly 250 feet -RRB- in an area partially illuminated by security lights and we think he -LRB- the guard -RRB- got a good look at them.'' <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON> said the guard reported all three wore camouflage uniforms, with `` one wearing a light-colored beret and the others... bush hats. He identified the guard only as a specialist 4th class with the 154th Signal Battalion, which is permanently based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON> said, a three-man reconnaisance team from the 193rd Light Infantry Brigade spotted about 30 intruders in a hilly, jungled area 1 -LCB- miles west of the main runway of <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> base at 8 p.m. <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON> said the soldiers set off two claymore mines by remote control, apparently scaring the intruders away before an Army Quick Reaction Team arrived. He said the reconnaissance team was not on guard duty, but declined to say why they were in the area. He said the mine blasts were not an attempt to harm the intruders, `` but to create a diversion.'' <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON> also said the soldiers did not fire their M-16 automatic rifles, so as not to give away their position. The Army munitions depot, the fuel storage area and the air base are within a few miles of each other, just outside <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> end of the canal. <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ormsby </PERSON> said an exhaustive sweep of the fuel storage depot failed to turn up proof of the intruders' identity. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that `` a limited amount of circumstantial physical evidence was found'' to support Marine claims that they were engaged in a firefight. It said the evidence included `` two bottles of insect repellant not used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces, a first aid bandage, and a black-colored handerchief.'' It said no shell casings were recovered.

 Riot troops broke up the second anti-American demonstration in this capital in as many weeks, hurling tear gas grenades and firing into the air to stop about 200 protesters headed for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. At least one person was arrested. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The protesters, chanting `` Embassy, embassy!'' had been part of a crowd of about 2,000 people who marched peacefully to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier Thursday to demonstrate against the Honduran government and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the Central American country. Five people were killed during a riot April 7 in which about 2,000 demonstrators sacked and burned the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> and offices of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Those protesters were angered over the deportation to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of a Honduran man accused of drug trafficking. About 50 riot police and army troops threw tear gas grenades into the 200 demonstrators as they advanced on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic mission Thursday night. The tear gas dispersed the protesters momentarily, but they regrouped, cutting off a small contingent of what appeared to be young and ill-trained troops who shot long bursts of fire from their M-16s into the air. The sound of shots sparked panic in the neighborhood. Some demonstrators taunted the troops and threw stones at the soldiers, who at intervals advanced behind metal shields. During the milelong march earlier Thursday, protesters chanted slogans calling for the expulsion of the approximately 1,100 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, the removal of U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and the defense of the Honduran Constitution. They condemned the government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> and what they called his subservience to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' staunchest ally in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Yankee garbage, out of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>!'' and `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> do n't get out, in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> they will die! shouted the demonstrators. The marchers, most of them students, walked to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where they listened to speeches condemning <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. About 500 demonstrators proceeded from there to the nearby <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION>, where they shouted for the release of inmates they consider political prisoners. A group then tried to go to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy. One of the issues the marchers protested was the forced extradition of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>. Honduran police, working with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents, arrested <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> at his <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> home on April 5 and had him flown to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Honduran Constitution prohibits the extradition of Honduran citizens. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> is in federal prison in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> is also wanted for questioning in the 1985 torture-slaying in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> estimates damage to the consulate building in the April 7 riot at between $ 4 million and $ 6 million and has asked for reimbursement from the Honduran government.

 A premature newborn chimpanzee named <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> is alive today thanks to volunteer pediatric specialists who brought their hospital skills to an animal-care nursery. `` I think the No. 1 thing was that it sounded like they needed some help,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyble </PERSON> of the neonatal unit at <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` Also, I felt it would be a challenge. The veterinarian was n't too familiar with the situation, and I was very familiar with it. The whole thing had a lot of appeal.'' Wyble, two nurses and a respiratory therapist from the hospital and a blood bank doctor teamed up with <ORGANIZATION> Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gardens </ORGANIZATION> veterinarian <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> here three weeks ago to save the 2-pound primate. Today, <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> seems to winning her battle to survive. The chimp is out of intensive care, and she's alert and is taking formula on her own, although she still has a stomach tube for feeding. The medical team is following the chimp for any developing problems, anemia or episodes of failed breathing. `` She's still got a long ways to go,'' <PERSON> Wyble </PERSON> said Thursday night. `` We're looking for evidence of good weight gain _ that's the ultimate proof that everything is going well. The medical team twice had to revive <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> when breathing stopped and her heart rate fell dramatically. They also ran intravenous fluids, attached monitoring equipment, hooked up oxygen, injected antibiotics, inserted feeding tubes, tested blood gases and gave transfusions. `` I felt like I was at work. That's how critical it was. She was dying,'' said nurse <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>. `` After the first 15 minutes you forgot it was an ape and could see how much she was like one of our babies,'' said the other nurse, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>. `` It's so neat to be able to use your experience and background to help another species,'' she said. `` It was n't like <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> was weird. She was just like a baby _ she'd grasp your finger, want to cling, whimper when you start an IV.'' Ms. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, a critical-care nurse for nearly 15 years; Ms. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, with 10 years in nursing; and respiration therapist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Tursi </PERSON> volunteered their help. The chimpanzee was born March 31 at <LOCATION> Busch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, a wildlife and amusement park that is home to 334 species of animals. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said he thinks <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> was born two to three weeks short of the normal 7 -LCB- - month gestation period

<HEAD>Public Being Misguided by AIDS-Prevention Strategies, Doctors Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A study found there is a one-in-50 million chance of getting the AIDS virus in a single sexual encounter with someone who does n't know whether he is infected, but is not considered `` high-risk'' and uses a condom. That compares with a one-in-10 ,000 to one-in-100 ,000 chance of getting the virus from the same type of encounter with a person who is in a high-risk group, said the study, reported in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> High-risk partners are people who, anytime within the past 10 years, have had male homosexual contact, shared intravenous drug needles, lived in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or received multiple blood products, the study said. Using condoms lowers risk of getting AIDS about 10-fold, regardless of other factors, said the study. Relying on a lab test that establishes one's sexual partner as free of the AIDS virus lessens risk about 100-fold. The study also found that AIDS-prevention campaigns may mislead the public when they stress condom use and fewer sexual partners over another strategy _ a cautious courtship in search of a low-risk lover. Choosing a partner who is known to have little chance of carrying the AIDS virus reduces the risk of infection by as much as 5,000 times compared with the risk of engaging in sex with a high-risk person, the study said. A knowledge of where the largest risks occur should lead people `` to move toward gradual courtships, to listen carefully for clues about a potential partner's past and to ask directly about any history of high-risk activities,'' the study said. `` We're not saying, ` Throw away your condoms,''' said Dr. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>, one of the study's authors and assistant professor of family medicine and epidemiology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` We're just saying this is something else to pay attention to that may be even more important,'' he said by telephone Thursday. Not only should a person ask a potential partner about past behavior but the person should learn enough about the partner `` to know whether to believe the answers,'' the study said. `` This would rule out sex with prostitutes, casual sex, and indeed, much of what many people would consider to be normal heterosexual behavior.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> and a colleague, Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hulley </PERSON>, analyzed estimates of the prevalence of AIDS infection and the likelihood it will be transmitted under different circumstances. An uninfected person had a one-in-50 million chance of getting the AIDS virus in a single encounter with a person who does n't know whether he is infected, but who uses a condom and is not in a high-risk group, the study said. The chance of getting the virus from a person who has a lab test showing no evidence of AIDS infection but who continues to engage in high-risk behavior is one in 500,000 for a single sexual encounter in which a condom is used. The impact of the test on risk is relatively low because it sometimes shows people to be free of the virus when they are not, <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> said. Also, people may fail to test positive for several months after they are infected. <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> said he believes the study is the first to quantify the relative risks of various prevention strategies for AIDS, which has struck more than 59,000 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and killed more than 33,000. More than 2,300 cases, or about 4 percent, are believed to have resulted from heterosexual contact. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the body's defenses against disease, leaving a person prey to life-threatening infections and certain cancers.

<HEAD>`Macbeth,' Starring Christopher Plummer and Glenda Jackson, Opens
on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs with other critics; no PMs planned.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 Considering the hurly-burly that accompanied `` Macbeth'' on its tumultuous pre-Broadway tour, it's surprising that the play which arrived Thursday at the Mark Hellinger Theater makes any sense at all. But the revival, starring <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s famous pair of murdering Scots, is a fast and straightforward production. Unfortunately, this version of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s shortest play sacrifices passion and inspiration for speed. Maybe all the blood was spilled in rehearsal. It was during those rehearsals that the show went through three directors, several set and costume designers and a half dozen or so actors. The theater program lists `` original direction'' by <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON>. Interim director <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> receives no credit at all, and actress <PERSON> Zoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> gets billed for `` additional direction.'' Who did what is impossible to determine but what's left on stage is a credible if colorless interpretation of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s tragedy. Its generic quality is telegraphed the minute the audience walks into the theater. What they see are large concrete-like slabs that look like a post-modernist version of Stonehenge. At center stage is a large blood-spattered throne, just in case you forget the plot. The all-purpose setting, designed by <PERSON> Daphne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dare </PERSON>, could be used for any of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s tragedies. What gives the play its moments of fascination are the performances of <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Not much electricity crackles between them, but individually they are able to set off a few sparks. They do it through two strikingly different approaches to their roles. <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON>'s quiet, almost thoughtful Macbeth is revealed slowly. At first, he is almost a bumbler, a good-natured if greedy man spurred onward by an aggressive wife. But after <PERSON> Macbeth </PERSON> commits that first murder, the actor reveals a cynical side that feeds on the power. It serves him well as the man who killed to be king eventually goes to his doom. Miss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s panther-like performance is showier. She prowls the stage like a cat in heat, lusting for power if not her husband. The one problem with the portrait is that Miss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> seems isolated from the rest of the cast. There's not much connection between the queen and her consort, let alone the rest of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Still, it's fun to watch the actress display her awesome technique even if it's done in a vacuum. The large supporting cast is uneven. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarfe </PERSON> as <PERSON> Macduff </PERSON> makes an unequal opponent for Macbeth, but <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> <PERSON> Mell </PERSON> is a strong-voiced, even noble <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON>. For some reason, one of the play's three witches is a man, an equal opportunity idea that is never developed. At least, these hags do n't provoke laughter. The lighting by <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> is as simple as the sets but much more imaginative as it dapples those dreary columns. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Zipprodt </PERSON>'s costumes are also stylish and colorful, particularly an earth-orange gown for Miss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Macbeth'' is not a disaster on the scale of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>'s recent all-star trashing of `` <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>.'' Still, it does n't offer any startling insights or interpretations into a most difficult play to put on stage. Audiences wo n't be embarrassed or bored by this production, but then they wo n't be surprised or exhilarated either. In other reviews: <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> writes: `` While the assets of the production ... do produce scattered fine moments and keep chaos at bay, the lack of a unifying guiding hand is apparent before intermission and proves fatal thereafter. ... once blood begins to beget blood, the performance goes nowhere.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> credits the production for an occasional `` vision of the world turned Inferno. More often than not, however, it's no more wrenching than Limbo. ... `` The overall lesson is that a classic play ... should be done only when a director has a clear, vital idea of how to do it, not because stars are available.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rose today in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> finishing the week higher against the Japanese yen, while stock prices were little changed. The dollar closed at 124.65 yen, up 0.35 yen from its close of 124.30 yen on Thursday. It had opened the day at 124.29 yen and ranged between 124.28 yen and 124.75 yen. Trading was mixed but the dollar-buying mood was strong, due partly to the U.S.-Iran conflict, said <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawai </PERSON> of the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The selling of the dollars later in the afternoon by export-related industries held back the currency a little, she said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 35.93 point loser Thursday, added another 8.96 points, or 0.03 percent, ending the day's trading at 26,837.12. `` Trading was relatively quiet as institutional investors sidestepped the market in the advance of the announcement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product next week,'' said an official of a major securities house, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Domestically, however, there is nothing to cause uneasiness among investors, he said. `` Investors have a little concern about Wall Street, but it is preventing the market from becoming overheated,'' he said. Popular issues were heavy electricals, automobiles and non-ferrous metals. Trading houses, department stores and printings were firm. Among the losers were constructions, textiles and shippings. Volume of the first-section trade was a light 700 million shares, up 650 million shares Thursday. Advancing issues outpaced decliners by 457 and 444, while 162 issues were unchanged. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stock market will have a half-day session on Saturday.

<HEAD>Murdoch Puts Boston TV Station Up For Sale</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Publisher <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> says he's selling his <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> television station because of his `` great uncertainty'' over renewal of his exemption from the federal ban on ownership of a newspaper and TV station in the same city. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> put WFTX-TV up for sale Thursday rather than ask the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to extend a waiver expiring June 30 that allows his <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to own both <ORGANIZATION> WFXT </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. A <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> spokesman said several parties had expressed interest in the station, but he declined to name them. He said no asking price had been set. The Australian publisher's decision came one month after the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> struck down a congressional amendment barring the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> from extending temporary waivers to its cross-ownership rule. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> did not apply for the waiver extension for <ORGANIZATION> WFXT </ORGANIZATION>, a UHF station he reportedly bought for $ 28 million. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> assailed the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> rule and Sens. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, who sponsored the no-extensions amendment `` I hope that the American newspaper industry together with broadcasters will continue to encourage federal decision-makers to modify the arcane newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule, which in fact works against the principle of diversity in such great centers of population as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>,'' he said. The March 29 court ruling said the <LOCATION> Kennedy-Hollings </LOCATION> amendment unconstitutionally singled out <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, but the appeals judges left intact the cross-ownership ban. `` While good progress has been achieved, <ORGANIZATION> WFXT </ORGANIZATION> has suffered as a result of the regulatory cloud that the Kennedy-Hollings amendment placed over our <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> operations,'' <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> said. `` There remains great uncertainty as to the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s position regarding waiver extensions in these circumstances.'' <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Squadron </PERSON> said in February that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> was unlikely to permanently exempt <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> from the cross-ownership rule in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. FCC general counsel <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Killory </PERSON> said at the time that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> normally grants temporary waivers to give the owner of a newspaper-TV combination time to sell one of the properties for a fair price and avoid a distress sale. For a permanent waiver, <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> rules require that the owner prove that one of the properties is in financial distress. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WFXT </ORGANIZATION> are known to be profitable. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> received temporary waivers from the cross-ownership rule after buying <ORGANIZATION> WFXT </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> station <ORGANIZATION> WNYW-TV </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. He was given until March 6 to sell either <ORGANIZATION> WNYW </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and until June 30 to sell <ORGANIZATION> WFXT </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Higher Doctor Bills Cutting into Savings of Heart-Attack Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The cost of an average hospital stay for heart-attack patients dropped by nearly half between 1972 and 1982 because of more effective, quicker treatment, a new study concludes. `` Put simply, doctors had better diagnostic and therapeutic tools available by 1982, and they began using them _ particularly coronary bypass surgery,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Showstack </PERSON>, one of four authors of the study published in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In 1972, a heart-attack patient with complications would be hospitalized for an average of 23 days and pay a bill of $ 20,900, <PERSON> Showstack </PERSON> said. By 1982, that same type of patient was hospitalized for an average of just 13 days and billed $ 10,200. Both bills were calculated in terms of the value of the dollar in 1982. However, doctors' costs, which comprised 4 percent of the total bill in 1972, reached 12 percent of the total by 1982, said <PERSON> Showstack </PERSON>. And in five 1982 cases where doctors performed coronary bypass surgery, the average total bill was $ 45,728 _ with doctors' costs making up about 29 percent of the total, he said. `` Everybody directed their efforts at lowering hospital costs, but they missed the rising costs on the other side of the bill,'' said <PERSON> Showstack </PERSON>, a public-health researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION>, `` And based on some other studies we've done, it's safe to say that both trends are continuing _ though not at the accelerated rate we saw over the 10-year period.'' Researchers looked at the medical records of 164 patients admitted to a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> hospital following heart attacks in 1972, 1977 and 1982. In coronary bypass surgery, a vein is removed from a patient's leg and used to bypass an obstructed artery leading to the heart Other costly surgical procedures now commonly used to treat heart attack patients include angioplasty, surgically inserting a balloon into an artery and inflating it to widen constricted blood vessels. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> study did not address the effectiveness of the various treatments in prolonging patients' lives. <PERSON> Showstack </PERSON> said: `` Some patients would die, clearly, without a bypass. On the other hand, there's really no evidence that post-heart-attack patients live longer with a bypass.''

<HEAD>PLO Chief Welcome In Syria For Talks To End Rift, Aide Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RIMA SALAMEH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senior aide to <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said today that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> would welcome the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman for reconciliation talks with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> to end the two Arab leaders' 5-year-old rift. <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s political department, made the statement after a four-hour meeting with Syrian Vice President <PERSON> Abdul-Halim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> sponsored a mutiny against <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> by radical Palestinian factions in 1983 and expelled the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. The two have been at odds since. The meeting between <PERSON> Khaddam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> was the first in five years between a ranking <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> official and senior <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> aides. <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> was accompanied by four members of the central committee of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> movement, the main faction in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the optimistic note sounded by <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON>, informed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> sources said there were still profound differences between <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> that will take time to resolve. They cautioned that there were no immediate prospects of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> visiting <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> to meet the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> president. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s main Arab ally, has been under pressure from the Soviets to reconcile with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> for the sake of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> unity to present a common front at any <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference that may be convened. <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Khaddam </PERSON> marked a significant step in that direction. Speaking to reporters following the late night meeting, <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Khaddam </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s closest aides, agreed to continue discussions to reach political agreements to support the Palestinian struggle against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He noted that a `` spirit of optimism and hope prevailed'' at the meeting for the resumption of relations between <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and `` to take broader and new steps in the history of the Arab struggle.'' `` I expect <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to come here as soon as possible. The door is open for all the -LRB- Palestinian -RRB- brothers to come to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. There are no obstacles,'' <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at his <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> headquarters that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> scrapped plans to fly to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to attend the funeral of one of his top officials because the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> had given no guarantees he would be given an official welcome. There had been hopes the funeral in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Wednesday of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s widely respected military commander, would provide the opportunity for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to visit <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. `` If I were in his shoes, I would not have missed this opportunity,'' <PERSON> Habash </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, better known by his nom de guerre of Abu Jihad, or Father of the Holy War, was assassinated by a commando squad in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> last Saturday. Israeli sources have said privately that the commandos were Israeli.

<HEAD>Tandy Announces First Erasable Compact Disk, IBM PS-2 `Clone'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it plans to sell the first erasable-recordable compact disk, an announcement that angered the recording industry, which fears consumers will use the product to copy music at home. The <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, Texas-based electronics manufacturer, which markets its products through its Radio Shack stores, also announced Thursday it will introduce a fast new personal computer that follows the design of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s year-old Personal System-2 <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> said the compact disk, known as the Thor CD, would be available for music in 1 -LCB- to two years and for data about a year after that, once recording and playback devices are built. The Thor CD could also be played _ although not recorded on _ in standard compact disk players, <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We're always concerned about technologies that threaten to enable consumers to infringe on copyrights,'' said <PERSON> Trish </PERSON> <PERSON> Heimers </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Recording </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. The association has fought digital audio tape, or DAT, technology that would allow people to make high-quality recordings at home. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> said it would not only manufacture <PERSON> Thor </PERSON> CD equipment, but would also license other companies to make it. Some day the invention might yield the company `` hundreds of millions of dollars'' a year in profits from sales and royalties, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> news conference. The Verbatim division of <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> has said it will introduce read-write compact disk technology, and several Japanese companies are known to be working on similar products, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The Times said some industry analysts were skeptical about <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION>'s invention, in part because <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> did n't show working hardware at the introduction. `` This is by no means a perfected technology,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajarin </PERSON>, an analyst with Creative Strategies in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> said it will be selling its Tandy 5000 MC in volume by July, a few months before <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the only other company that has announced a PS-2 `` clone. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> officials said their new computer was covered by a patent cross-licensing agreement with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, although certain PS-2 patents that may be issued to <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> in the future are still subject to negotiations. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> stock rose $ 2.62 -LCB- a share to $ 45.75 Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 A day set to mark the 40th anniversary of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> campus here ignited clashes between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups that led to 17 arrests, authorities said. The campus branch of B'nai B'rith <PERSON> Hillel </PERSON> <PERSON> Foundation </PERSON>, a Jewish group, sponsored an anniversary program in a lecture hall on campus Thursday, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON>, a university spokesman. A group of 50 or 60 pro-Palestinians gathered in an outdoor area in the center of campus along with an equal number opposed to the Palestinian group, he said. `` It was noisy but orderly for about an hour, then there was an outbreak of scuffles between the demonstrating groups,'' Fanning said. Ten pro-Palestinians stormed the program inside the auditorium and were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, officials said. The remaining arrests took place outside.

 Gunmen eluded a huge manhunt early today after fleeing the bank in this northwestern coastal city where their botched robbery turned into a 24-hour hostage drama in which five people were killed. Unconfirmed local press reports said the robbers took about $ 13,000 in bank money. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, a policeman participating in the hunt, confirmed some money was taken but declined to say how much. About 500 police and army personnel backed by a helicopter searched for the seven young men Thursday night and police set up blockades on highways leading out of the city. `` The gunmen must have gone to the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION>, where it will be difficult to locate them,'' said <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madre </LOCATION> mountain range is nearby. The gunmen had holed up inside the local <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> offices after an alarm foiled their robbery. They let their 42 hostages go Thursday when they were permitted to flee in an armored car with three <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers. Apparently as part of an agreement ending the standoff, most of the hundreds of police who had surrounded the bank withdrew and people massed in the street outside the building. `` This is incredible. These people are supporting the robbers,'' a woman standing nearby told a reporter. Police said the robbers released the three <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers 15 minutes after leaving the bank, abandoning the armored car at a gas station and took off in a stolen pickup truck and station wagon. One of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers, <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Angulo </PERSON>, said there were only five gunmen in the armored car, which he was forced to drive. `` I think the other two mixed in among the crowd at the moment of leaving the bank,'' he said. <PERSON> Angulo </PERSON> said the robbers strapped sticks of dynamite to their bodies and toted sawed-off machine guns. Gov. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Labastida </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> state told the <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION> TV network the release agreement allowed police to pursue the gunmen. `` We're not deceiving anyone,'' the governor said. `` We simply reached an agreement in which we could safeguard lives.'' <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, a spokesman for the governor, said the gunmen demanded earlier that they be allowed to leave by air. Police said the robbers were in their late teens or early 20s and had no political motives. The standoff in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mochis </LOCATION>, a town of 120,000 on the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> about 500 miles south of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, began at 12:45 p.m. Wednesday when the gunmen took hostages after an alarm alerted police there was a robbery in progress. Red Cross spokesmen said five people were killed and at least 15 wounded during the attempted robbery and ensuing siege. Spokesman <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON> of the local <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said one of its rescue workers was among those killed in a gunfight Wednesday between police and the robbers. He said the others slain were a customer, bank official and teller, and a policeman who was in the bank on business. The wife of one hostage said her husband, farmworker <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Terraza </PERSON>, 29, was seriously wounded during the gunfight and was hospitalized in grave condition. `` He only wanted to cash a check,'' she said. Bank robberies and other crime have increased significantly in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since 1982, when an economic crisis began to eat away purchasing power and drive up unemployment. <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> is known as a center for crime, especially of the type linked to the illegal drug trade.

<TEXT>
 The Nationalist government today released about 6,000 prisoners, including 19 political detainees, in a mass amnesty marking the 100th day since President <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>'s death <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shih-min </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, said about 16,000 other prisoners, including 11 charged with sedition, had their sentences reduced. They remained behind bars pending completion of the shortened jail terms. Justice officials said the release of 6,054 gangsters, drug addicts, corrupt officials and other convicted criminals began at dawn after brief ceremonies held at jails throughout the island. Each prisoner was presented a red package containing the equivalent of about $ 17 to wish them luck, they said. Television showed the prisoners, some smiling and some tearful, being met by anxious wives, children and other relatives waiting in drizzly weather outside jail. Transportation officials reported all domestic flights and trains were packed as prisoners and their relatives headed for home. Five political prisoners were welcomed by about 50 relatives and members of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> upon arriving at <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>'s domestic airport from a jail on <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 180 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>. Prominent dissident <PERSON> Tai </PERSON> <PERSON> Hua-kuang </PERSON>, 37, was among the political prisoners released from <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1978 on charges of plotting to topple the Nationalist government by forming an underground communist organization. Another dissident, <PERSON> Pai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ya-chan </PERSON>, had tears in his eyes as he told reporters he was grateful for those people who `` fought hard for human rights and ending political oppression.'' He said he wanted to join opposition politics. <PERSON> Pai </PERSON>, 47, was sentenced in 1975 to life imprisonment for distributing leaflets calling on <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON>, then chairman of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, to reveal his wealth and to recall his daughter from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to show his confidence in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Under the commutation, death sentences were reduced to life imprisonment, life sentences to 15 years and lesser sentences were cut by one-third or one-half. Many prisoners released today already were serving sentences reduced when martial law was lifted last July. <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> said the commutations affected all but a few hundred prisoners sentenced for first-degree murders, ammunition smuggling and other crimes that could `` endanger national security and social stability.'' Two political prisoners did not have their sentences reduced because they were accused of being Communists, officials said. Two men jailed earlier this year for advocating an independent <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> were not affected by the commutation because the verdicts are under appeal. President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON> proposed the commutations in February after succeeding <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON>, who died of heart failure Jan. 13. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, the first native Taiwanese to head the Nationalist government, approved final details of the plan on Tuesday. Among the released political prisoners were six Taiwanese businessmen sentenced in 1984 and 1986 to 10-to-12 years in jail for visiting mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on business, justice officials said. Last October, <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> eased a ban on travel to the mainland to allow family reunions. Many Taiwanese have since visited <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to explore business possibilities. Nationalist leader <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>, the late president's father, led his government in retreat to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communists on the Chinese mainland. The Nationalists still claim to be the rightful rulers of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and do not allow official contacts with the mainland. After <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> died in 1975, the government released 3,500 prisoners reduced the sentences of 13,000 others in a similar mass commutation.

<TEXT>
 Melanesian separatists attacked a police station in this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> territory at dawn today, killing three <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officers with machetes and hatchets and kidnapping 26 others, officials said. About 20 people were wounded, including four Melanesians, in the attack by about 30 mean in <LOCATION> Fayaoue </LOCATION>, on the outer island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, part of the <LOCATION> Loyalty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>'s eastern coast. The wounded were being taken by air to <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>, capital of this <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> territory 1,000 miles east of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Two were reported in critical condition, including a policeman shot in the back of the head. Police launched a massive operation backed by helicopters to locate the attackers, who officials said were hiding the abducted officers in the bush. About 200 police reinforcements were rushed to <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>. The rebels were demanding the police reinforcements withdraw and a special envoy be sent by <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON>, president of the regional government in central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> called an emergency meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers directly concerned with overseas territories and security. <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON>, who said he had talked with leaders of the attackers, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone: `` The gendarmes -LRB- police officers -RRB- held by the people in <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> are in good health. There are no wounded among them. They are being well treated.'' He said the attackers refused to negotiate until police withdrew. `` We regret that there were deaths, but it happened at a time when they must stop considering us like birds on the road to extinction,'' said <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON>, who is also official of the main Melanesian separatist organization, the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The indigenous but minority Melanesians, or Kanaks, are seeking to end 135 years of direct French rule and have vowed to boycott Sunday's regional elections. More than 31 people, including 10 policemen, have died in five years of riots, slayings and clashes involving predominantly <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> settlers and <PERSON> Kanaks </PERSON>, who comprise 43 percent of the nickel-rich territory's 145,000 people. The front claims to represent most Kanaks in the struggle for independence. Front leader <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> by telephone that he had no advance knowlege of today's attack. But he said it was `` part of colonial history. That is what happens when you scorn and disdain the Kanaks.'' Witnesses said the attackers seemed to be well prepared. The police station was sacked and a large amount of equipment was stolen. Details were difficult to obtain as communications between <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION> and the island 90 miles away were abruptly cut. Families of the policemen, who lived at the station, were not attacked and suffered no injuries, officials said. The three slain policemen died from machete or hatchet wounds, police said. <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON> called the incident `` frightful,'' but said it was not surprising in that `` demands for independence are absolutely not taken into consideration, that people are scorned and the government refuses to listen to them.'' Last month, <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> that his group planned a `` confrontation'' before the elections. He said at the time that `` outright war'' was impossible because of the French military presence. Kanaks have consistently lost all elections on the independence question, and <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON> called for the boycott Sunday to protest redrawn electoral boundaries he says discriminate against Kanaks. Several family members and tourists evacuated from <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> today arrived at <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION> airport. `` They evacuated all of the whites,'' said a young Belgian woman. The police station attack followed a bomb explosion earlier today near military headquarters in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>, the capital, and the torching of a town hall. There were no apparent casualties and no group claimed responsibility.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS JACK WILLIAMS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Senior officers said it will take some time to determine how many missilies were fired at this <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship and two others in a daylong <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> clash with Iranian forces. They noted with satisfaction that reports from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> indicating the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> account of Monday's missile firing was not being disputed. High officals there were saying only that there was `` no positive evidence'' that Chinese-made Silkworms were used. Capt. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>, Commander of <ORGANIZATION> Destroyer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> 22, said the fact that three ships were under fire, maneuvering and firing chaff, `` could mean some duplication'' in the reports of missiles being fired. `` But there is no doubt that missiles were fired at these ships,'' he said. As to what type of missile was used, <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> said; `` It was big, it was fast, and it came from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' The ships were the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a 3,700-ton guided missile frigate, the 4,500-ton missile destroyer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> and the 7,810-ton destroyer <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. The ships make up one of the three three-ship groups involved in Monday's coordinated retaliatory raids on Iranian targets and Iranian reprisals. Monday's clash was the fiercest between the Americans and the Iranians since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> buildup in the gulf last July. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deployment of the Silkworms, a Chinese-made variant of the 30-year-old Soviet STYX missile, was revealed a year ago. The Silkworms had never been fired at any military or commercial vessels passing through the strategic waterway. The missiles are about eight feet long and have a range of about 50 miles with a full 1,000-pound warhead. They fly at about 600 mph, just below the speed of sound, at about 100 feet above the surface, homing in on the target by a narrow-band radar. Although crude by modern standards, the Silkworm is an effective weapon. `` It just is n't smart,'' said <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>. `` The silkworm has no brain. Whatever it spots first, it will reach out and touch.'' It was for that reason that the Iranian Silkworm missile that hit the reflagged <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> tanker <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> last Oct. 17 was termed a `` lucky shot'' by many <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers at the time. The missile, fired from the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> of southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, was fired in the direction of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s big <PERSON> Al-Ahmadi </PERSON> oil terminal and hit the tanker only because it saw it first, they said. Monday's fighting began after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyed two offshore Iranian oil platforms. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered the platforms attacked as retaliation for a mine that blew a hole in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> last week and wounded 10 sailors. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said an Iranian patrol boat was sunk, three armed speedboats sunk or damaged and the frigates Sabalan and Sahand disabled.

<HEAD>Anti-Acne Drug Linked To Hundreds of Birth Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is considering severely limiting or banning the sale of a popular anti-acne drug because of its estimate that hundreds of severe birth defects have been caused by the medication, it was reported today. In a confidential memorandum dated Feb. 11 and obtained Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> estimated that 900 to 1,300 babies were born with severe birth defects from 1982 to 1986 because of the drug Accutane. Accutane, made by <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Nutley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, is used against disfiguring acne. It carries a strong warning label, and the company has conducted extensive campaigns to publicize its risk of causing birth defects. A spokeswoman for the manufacturer disputed the government figures, saying Thursday that it has reports of 62 cases of Accutane-related birth defects among the 700,000 to 1 million patients with cystic acne for whom the drug has been prescribed. `` We do not want to dispute the fact that this drug is associated with birth defects,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON>. `` We want to find ways to further reinforce that message.'' Ms. <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> said the company would meet with the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to discuss ways to better educate the public, doctors and pharmacists. Despite clear warnings that the drug can cause devastating and sometimes fatal deformities if taken by pregnant women, experts estimate thousands have taken Accutane during pregnancy since it came on the market in 1982, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials also attributed 700 to 1,000 spontaneous abortions to the use of Accutane, and they estimated that an additional 5,000 to 7,000 women had induced abortions `` solely because of Accutane exposure and fear of birth defects,'' the newspaper reported. The estimates were extrapolated from data collected in a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Medicaid study. Ms. <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> said that in the 62 cases of birth defects known to the company, the babies were born with severe disfigurations, primarily malformations of the head and ears. About half the afflicted children died at birth, she said. Accutane accounts for between $ 40 million and $ 50 million in sales annually, she said. The drug shuts down the production of sebum, which is the oily fatty substance that causes the inflammation, pain and eventually scarring of cystic acne. The drug's generic name is isotretinoin. Officials believe that many women and their doctors do not always recognize the link between the drug and deformities in babies. By September 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> had received reports of only 52 babies with Accutane-caused deformities, according to the Times. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, a dermatologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, agreed the situation `` is a serious problem,'' but he said Accutane is the only treatment available for many patients with disfiguring acne. `` Accutane is an extremely important drug,'' he told the Times. He stressed that severe acne, left uncontrolled, `` scars patients both physically and psychologically.''

<TEXT>
 Rock star <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> testified before a courtroom packed with excited fans that he did not hear a reggae song called `` Just Another Night'' before writing his own song with the same name in 1983. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>, lead singer of the Rolling Stones, is being sued for copyright infringement by <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>, 36, of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, who claims <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> pirated the chorus of his 1979 song. Appearing slightly nervous at he took the stand Thursday, <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goettel </PERSON> and the jury that he had often recorded works by other people in his 25 years as a musician and had always given them credit. But, he said, he never heard <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s song until he was sued by <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> in 1986, one year after `` Just Another Night'' appeared on the album, `` She's the Boss.'' Asked by his attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Parcher </PERSON> whether he liked <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>'s song, <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> said carefully: `` I do n't want to cast aspersion on Mr. <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> A lot of people in this courtroom do n't like my music. Personally, I do n't really like that song.'' To demonstrate how <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> developed his song, tapes dating to November 1983 were played. The first tape was a version of the song <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> described as `` just me with acoustic guitar starting off with this tune.'' <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>, who swayed with the music each time, occasionally appeared embarrassed as some of tapes had him just making sounds with the music. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s guitar and other equipment had been set up in court, but another of his lawyers, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Margolis </PERSON>, said he would play `` only if he has to.'' Another of <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s attorneys, <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, said that if <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> performed it would be to show how he developed the song. Independent development of the same or similar ideas would not violate copyright law, she said. Earlier, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricigliano </PERSON>, chairman of the theory department at the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION>, said that while the rhythmical settings of the two choruses were similar because of the similarity of lyrics and ideas, the choruses were `` totally different'' in every musical way. He said a review of song titles at the Performing Arts Library in <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> revealed more than one dozen songs since 1928 with the title `` Just Another Night,'' and at least one with the title `` Just Another Night with You.'' An expert who testified for <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> said the choruses of the two songs were `` virtually identical.'' Alley's chorus contains the words: `` Can I spend another, just another night, just another night, just another night with you.'' <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s lines are, `` Give me just another night, just another night with you. Give me just another kiss, just before the dawn breaks through.'' The jury will determine whether there was an actual infringement of <LOCATION> Alley </LOCATION>'s copyright. If there was, a second trial will determine damages.

 Thousands of people sang, danced and threw roses and confetti as 29 Kuwaitis freed by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> gunmen after a 16-day hijacking ordeal arrived home from <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. While the Kuwaitis celebrated Thursday, Western diplomatic sources said the nine pro-Iranian hijackers, who were given safe passage out of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> had reached <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The two other freed hostages, Saudi Arabian citizens, were flown home in a private executive jet. Today's editions of The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified Arab officials as saying the hijackers, who had killed two Kuwaiti hostages, were flown on a private Algerian jet to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and then were believed to have traveled by land to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The officials also were quoted as saying that, with the exception of one Iranian, most of the hijackers were thought to be Lebanese citizens. Western intelligence sources have said that the nine are believed to be members of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremist group based in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mediator in the hijacking was quoted by a <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> newspaper today as saying the gunmen originally planned to land in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, blow up the plane and keep the passengers hostage in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Syrian troops, who control the airport, refused to let the plane land. As they arrived in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> Thursday night, women threw roses and confetti at the 22 passengers and seven crew members who had been prisoners in the seized <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747. Several said they were certain <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was a party to the hijacking. The emir of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, and Crown Prince <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> led the group of government officials and relatives that met the freed captives at the <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> airport. The hostages included three cousins of the emir. Kuwaitis at the airport celebrated their leaders' resolve in not bowing to the hijackers' demand that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> release 17 pro-Iranian terrorists jailed for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in 1983. Flocks of doves soared over the airport after the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 touched down, completing a six-hour flight from <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, where the ordeal ended early Wednesday. Bedouin men danced and clapped at the Kuwaiti airport, and children waved flags and sang, `` God bless our father, <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON>,'' referring to the emir. The freed hostages traveled by motorcade to the city center along a route lined by thousands of people. Hundreds followed in cars and limousines, honking their horns and singing, `` We sacrifice blood and souls for you, O <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>.'' The hijackers, who dumped the bodies of two <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> security men from the seized plane while it was on the ground in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, apparently agreed to free the remaining hostages in return for safe passage. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, which mediated, has refused to discuss the deal. Algerian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said the hijackers slipped out of the plane shortly before the hostages were let out. Some of the freed <PERSON> Kuwaitis </PERSON> said one hijacker was replaced by two others when the plane landed in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, April 5, the day it was seized on a Bangkok-Kuwait flight with 122 aboard. `` One of the two was obviously a military pilot. He was ordering other gunmen around and telling them lots of things about the aircraft and supervising the wiring of explosives to most parts of the plane,'' said passenger <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaferi </PERSON>. The claims corroborated accounts of hostages freed earlier in the ordeal, some of whom said additional weapons and explosives were brought aboard in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, where the plane spent three days. The Times quoted the Arab sources as saying the plane was supplied at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> with communications gear that allowed it to stay in touch with outside parties that were issuing instructions, at least at <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Malaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdo </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said the hijackers' plan to land in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was foiled when President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> refused to let the plane land, <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Paese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported today. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abdo </PERSON> acted as a mediator in negotiations with the hijackers in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, the plane's second stop. The hijackers released 57 hostages in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> and 13 at <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> in exchange for the fuel that took them to their third stop, <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, where an elderly diabetic was released last week. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and other Arab countries praised <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> for achieving freedom for the hostages without additional violence. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other Western powers criticized <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> for allowing the hijackers to get away. A Soviet-built Antonov transport of the Algerian air force was seen taking off from the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> airport before dawn Wednesday, shortly before the hostages left the hijacked plane. It was widely assumed the hijackers were aboard.

<HEAD>Orders for Durable Goods Virtually Unchanged in March</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for `` big ticket'' durable goods were virtually unchanged in March as a drop in orders for military hardware more than offset gains elsewhere, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted $ 114.3 billion last month. That was a negligible $ 53 million rise and followed a slight 0.1 percent increase in February and a sharp 1.2 percent drop in January. Economists had been expecting a substantial increase in new orders for March. However, the February number represents a sharp upward revision from a previous estimate of a 1.1 percent drop. In March, a 3.0 percent drop in the volatile defense goods category, to $ 8.3 billion, more than offset a 0.3 percent increase in orders for non-defense goods, which rose to $ 106.0 billion. Orders for primary metals such as steel jumped 4.2 percent in March after a 0.9 percent rise in February. At $ 10.8 billion, they stood 19.4 percent ahead of last year. There was also strength in transportation, primarily motor vehicles and aircraft. It rose 2.5 percent to $ 31.3 billion, after a strong 5.5 percent boost in February. Analysts, in advance of the report, attributed much of the increase in that category to a rise in orders for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION>. Orders for electrical machinery plummeted 4.7 percent to $ 18.6 billion, while non-electrical machinery edged down 0.2 percent to $ 19.7 billion. The key category of non-defense capital goods, which economists consider a good indicator of factory expansion plans, fell 1.3 percent, on top of a 3.0 percent decline in February. But, at $ 33.3 billion, it was still 20.1 percent ahead of a year ago. Shipments of durable goods rose 2.6 percent in March to $ 113.3 billion after a 1.4 percent rise in February.

 Some Christian activists say they will vigorously oppose a <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> movie based on a book in which <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is portrayed as a wimp who lusts after a prostitute. `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' called a look at the human side of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, was shot in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> last fall. It stars <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON> as <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Keitel </PERSON> as <PERSON> Judas </PERSON> <PERSON> Iscariot </PERSON>. Scheduled for release in September, the movie is based on Greek author <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON>' 1955 book `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' which was condemned as heretical by the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. In a section of the book that troubles some conservative Christians, Satan tempts <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> with lust for <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>, a prostitute who became one of his followers. In another, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> apparently ponders homosexuality. `` I do n't see how a producer can stay true to the book and not come out with a movie that is offensive to the Christian community. The book is shot through with contradictions of the scriptures,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> minister who heads the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, which monitors television shows and films. `` We're trying to head the movie off at the pass so it's not blasphemous,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Baehr </PERSON>, editor of an Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> newsletter that monitors theatrical films. Only <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>, who is editing the film in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, knows what's in the final version, and `` he does n't talk to any press at all when he's editing, on any movie,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Billings </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>, who directed `` Taxi Driver'' and `` Raging Bull,'' once studied for the priesthood. `` This is a film that I've wanted to make for 15 years, both as a filmmaker and Christian,'' he said in a statement. `` I'm making a deeply religious film which is an affirmation of faith, and I ask everyone not to judge my film until they see it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> has hired a born-again <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> marketing consultant, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Penland </PERSON>, who advised on the films `` Chariots of Fire'' and `` The Mission,'' to help ward off controversy. `` I think there's an awful lot of interest in this movie in the Christian community, and there's paranoia about what it contains,'' <PERSON> Penland </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> said a sacrilegious film would provoke a protest against Universal and its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will be prepared to fight it with everything we've got. And it would be an easy battle to win,'' <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> said. The Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Probst </PERSON>, a Baptist minister whose <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Focus </ORGANIZATION> group offers Bible study classes at studios and networks, has objected to the portrayal of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as `` a wimpy, almost milquetoast'' character. He has asked Christians to write <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> motion picture group, with their concerns. `` The attempt of this movie is not to be prurient about <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said. `` This is one of our great filmmakers, and to cast the film as sacrilegious before anyone has seen it is unfair.''

<TEXT>
 A faculty decision to require more black professors at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> makes the school a leader on an issue that troubles nearly every college and university in the nation, a black professor says. `` I think this whole affair will reflect positively on <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Erdman </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmore </PERSON> said Thursday after a faculty council adopted a resolution to require each of the school's 56 departments and programs to add at least one black faculty member by fall of 1993. `` As far as I know, we are the first university establishing such a strong policy mandating the hiring of more black faculty.'' The measure, passed 35-19, is subject to endorsement by the administration, but approval was expected because the resolution had the support of university President <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodie </PERSON>. More than 100 students wearing black-and-white checkered armbands cheered and waved signs at Thursday's crowded meeting as the council adopted the resolution after weeks of heated campus debate. `` It's a clear victory _ we're ecstatic,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 20, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's going to provide a clearly diverse education for students at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> and give us mentors in our field of interest.'' `` We did it peacefully and diplomatically,'' added <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Deane </PERSON>, 21, a black student from <LOCATION> Lynchburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> has 31 black faculty members out of a total of 1,399 Fourteen are in the university's medical school, while there are 40 departments with no black faculty. `` Last year, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> hired 155 faculty _ five of them black,'' <PERSON> Brodie </PERSON> said prior to the vote. `` My prediction is without this resolution, this year we will do about the same.'' The resolution was largely symbolic, since the university administration could have adopted the policy on its own, but it preferred to get a faculty consensus first, said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, chairman of the faculty committee. The debate had centered on whether the resolution should `` require'' the university to hire more blacks. The council on March 17 struck the word, instead instructing the administration `` to provide incentives.'' That vote sparked campuswide protests and generated a petition signed by about 2,500 people asking the council to reconsider. All seven members of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faculty </ORGANIZATION>, which worked to bring more black professors to <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, resigned from the panel in protest April 8. Thursday's vote restored the original language and also added a demand for money for the recruiting of more black faculty. <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> officials said there are 758 minority students among the 6,423 undergraduates and 530 minorities among the 4,368 graduate and professional students.

 Politicians are taking over from religious leaders in the task of easing human suffering, former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> says. Religiously inspired warfare is creating more and more suffering, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said Thursday at the opening of a three-day conference on `` Theology, Politics and Peace'' sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Candler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theology </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Three Blacks Killed, Four Policemen Shot</HEAD>

 Gunmen today wounded four policemen who were arresting participants in a rent boycott, police and press reports said. Police said three blacks were killed Thursday. Two men were stoned to death near the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Cradock </LOCATION>, and a youth was fatally shot near <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, police said. Three black constables and a white sergeant were ambushed about 1 a.m. today as they drove through <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, a huge black community outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, police said. A black civilian in their vehicle also was wounded, and a search was launched for the assailants. The constables, whose names were withheld, were taken to a black hospital in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. Sgt. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> was taken to a white hospital in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> as saying the officers had been arresting people for refusing to pay rent. Thousands of Sowetans whose homes are owned by the municipal council have been engaged in a rent boycott for nearly two years as a protest against government policies. Police have frequently been the target of attacks since late 1984 when black communities began to fight back against white control. Under the South African system of apartheid, the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. The 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. In <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and the Johannesburg-area industrial city of <LOCATION> Germiston </LOCATION>, police units surrounded and searched offices of the largest black labor federation, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions. The deployment coincided with commemoration services by union members for seven black railway workers killed in clashes with police one year ago during a strike. State-of-emergency regulations imposed Feb. 25 prohibit the labor federation from commemorating anniversaries of `` violent events.'' The two black men killed in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, both 22, apparently died in separate incidents in the black township of <LOCATION> Lingelihle </LOCATION>, national police headquarters in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> said in a statement. Police did not name the men. A black youth was shot and killed by an unidentified gunman in a black neighborhood near <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, police said. Schools around <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> have been hit this week by student demonstrations against detentions of students and teachers and against the death sentence for the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six _ five men and a woman accused of taking part in a mob killing of a black town councilor four years ago. About 250 students at <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinton </PERSON> high school in <LOCATION> Athlone </LOCATION> displayed placards today that read, `` Do n't Hang the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six, <PERSON> Hang </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>.'' It was a reference to President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Thursday that he would move for black participation in Cabinet-level policy-making as part of the dominant <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s program of gradual reform.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> today that `` we're marking time'' in superpower relations as hope for a new arms control accord faded. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> disagreed. `` From our point of view, we are far from marking time,'' he said. `` We are keeping time in a very strong way.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> differed with the Soviet leader's appraisal at a news conference after a three-hour session. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did not list an arms reduction treaty as one of the `` significant achievements'' to be expected when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> meets with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit May 29-June 2. In fact, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` the going is hard'' to complete a pact to reduce strategic nuclear weapons in the five weeks remaining. `` It's pick and shovel work,'' he said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s session with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the gilded <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>'s Hall followed nine hours of talks with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> over two days. When <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told the Soviet leader: `` I'm here to make preparations for the president's visit,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> responded: `` As for the substance, it seems that we are losing something. Maybe we're marking time.'' The two men shook hands at the outset, but <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> seemed somewhat subdued. American reporters were cautioned by Soviet officials that if they tried to ask questions of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during the photo-taking session they would not be invited back. Usually, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> welcomes a few questions. There have been reports of a Kremlin power struggle between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, the man reputed to rank second in the ruling Politburo. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> is regarded as more conservative than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, especially on the Soviet leader's policy of `` glasnost,'' or greater openness on selected topics. Reports this week have said <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> may have been stripped of some of his power. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made no mention of the reports at his news conference. But he spoke positively of the way U.S.-Soviet relations have evolved since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s rise to power three years ago. He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s summit meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would have `` a very businesslike tone'' and the two leaders would have `` a great deal of substance to talk about.'' Through interpreters, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> joked a bit with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> over the many thousands of miles the American envoy had logged recently in trips to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. American officials have virtually abandoned hopes of completing a treaty to reduce long-range nuclear missiles by the time the summit starts. On the regional front, there was little superpower cooperation. Despite another appeal by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, the Soviets still declined to support an international arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which delays any action by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official told reporters Thursday that a newly submitted Soviet draft on space defense conforms to a tough Soviet line that could make weapons cutbacks impossible. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hoped to sign a treaty at the summit to reduce arsenals of long-range bombers, missiles and submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent. But the Soviets, suspicious of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` Star Wars'' program, want a guarantee they could halt the cutbacks if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> conducts tests in space judged to be in violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has strenuously resisted limits on the program that seeks a space-based defense against ballistic missiles. One small note of progress was an agreement on procedures for joint underground nuclear tests in July. The first test will be held in the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> desert, the other at <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION>, in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. The idea is to compare <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet techniques for measuring the extent of the explosions. In reports to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has accused the Soviets of exceeding the 150 kiloton ceiling set in 1974 and 1976 treaties. The Soviets denied the charges. If the two sides can agree on measurements and make them more precise, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may submit the treaties to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for ratification before he leaves office next January. One kiloton is equivalent to the explosion of 1,000 tons of TNT. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who have held three rounds of talks, will meet again in mid-May, two weeks before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed an accord ridding both of their nations of medium - and shorter-range missiles They called then for another pact cutting strategic arms by 50 percent, but negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> have been proceeding slowly.

 Police today hunted the killers of a Mozambican rebel leader, and the rebels accused <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s Marxist government of assassinating him <PERSON> Evo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>, an influential figure in the Mozambican National Resistance, was shot five times before his body was dumped outside <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, police said. The body was found Thursday on a country road about 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> after he met with suspected agents of the Mozambican government, his wife said. <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement today that <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> had been shot once above the left eye, three times around the heart and once in the stomach. The statement said police were investigating several clues they expected to shed light on the crime. In a statement issued in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> today, the rebels blamed the Mozambican government for `` the barbarous crime.'' The government of the southern African nation denied the allegation. The rebels, also known by the Portuguese acronym <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION>, have been fighting a guerrilla war since 1977 to topple <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s government Guerrilla representatives operate in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, the colonial ruler of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> until 1975. Hundreds of police had been searching for <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> since Monday, when his wife, <PERSON> Yvette </PERSON>, said he disappeared after meeting two men who said the Mozambican government had empowered them to initiate peace talks with the rebels. <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>, a founder and former secretary-general of <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION>, believed the two men he dined with Sunday were authorized to approach him to set up negotiations with Mozambican officials, his wife said. When her husband failed to return, Mrs. <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> said Monday she believed he had been abducted by Mozambican security agents. Mozambican Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pascoal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mocumbi </PERSON> said today his government had no connection with the killing. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> `` does not commit acts of terrorism,'' he told the official news agency AIM. He suggested that <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> was killed as a result of `` splits and conflicts'' within RENAMO. Portuguese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Deus </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinheiro </PERSON> condemned the assassination. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> have criticized <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> for allowing rebel spokesmen to operate in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> government says it will act to prevent subversive actions by the rebels but can not interfere with the free speech of their spokesmen. <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>' body was found in undergrowth beside a road about six miles north of the resort town of <LOCATION> Cascais </LOCATION>, where he lived. <LOCATION> Cascais </LOCATION> is about 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>, 44, a <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> citizen born in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, was secretary-general of <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION> from 1983 to 1986. He was later demoted to head of the guerrillas' research department, but he remained an influential figure within the group. <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> had gone to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> in January and met rebel chief <PERSON> Afonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhlakama </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dhlakama </PERSON> condemned the killing and praised <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> as a `` fighter for freedom'' in a statement distributed in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>' predecessor as <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristina </PERSON>, was shot to death in his bed in April 1983 in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 A woman who told police in 1968 that she saw a girl in a polka-dot dress running from the scene of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s slaying told a radio station that investigators badgered her into changing her story. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano-Sewell </PERSON>, 40, said Thursday she never recanted her tale of a young woman running from the Ambassador Hotel after the Kennedy's assassination. The woman, she said, told her and others standing outside: `` We shot him. We shot him.'' During the interview with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> KUOP </ORGANIZATION> radio in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Serrano-Sewell </PERSON> admitted she altered her initial description of the dress, but blamed police harassment for the change. `` There was a lot of badgering that was going on,'' she said. `` I was just 20 years old, and I became unglued.'' Police files of the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> investigation released in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> on Tuesday reported that Ms. <PERSON> Serrano-Sewell </PERSON> fully recanted the story about two weeks after <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s June 5 assassination, which came moments after he had declared victory in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> presidential primary. `` The whole thing was a lie,'' the files quoted Ms. <PERSON> Serrano-Sewell </PERSON> as saying on June 20, 1968. However, she now says that lengthy grilling in a police interrogation room, where white polka-dot dresses were tacked all over the walls, caused her to give in. `` I said what they wanted me to say,'' Ms. <PERSON> Serrano-Sewell </PERSON> said. `` I do n't want to have to go through that again, that kind of everyday harassment _ being put in a room for hours with polka-dot dresses all around you. It was just a bad scene.'' She said she felt singled out for police scrutiny although she said four other witnesses standing outside the hotel that night reported similar accounts of a fleeing young woman. The recently released police files said Ms. <PERSON> Serrano-Sewell </PERSON> recanted her story after failing a lie detector test. Police canceled an all-points bulletin seeking a woman in a white polka-dot dress the next day.

The attempted resignation of <PERSON> Smokey </PERSON> was part of a peaceful demonstration Thursday outside the regional offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> by Earth First!, a radical environmental group. Other demonstrations in observance of the 150th birthday of <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Muir </PERSON> were held in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, at <ORGANIZATION> Sequoia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Porterville </LOCATION>, and at the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rivers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Eureka </LOCATION>. In <PERSON> Muir </PERSON>'s honor, Thursday was proclaimed by protesters as a National Day of Outrage'' at forest policies. About 150 people marched in front of the headquarters building in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, chanting and toting signs roughly along the same lines: `` No More Clear Cutting, No More Roads On Our Public Lands,'' and `` Only You Can Prevent Clear Cutting.'' Clear-cutting is the total clearance of an area. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> calls logging `` harvesting,'' part of a program of `` intelligent and sound land management,'' the service's regional timber management director <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinmann </PERSON> told reporters at an impromptu news conference At <LOCATION> Porterville </LOCATION>, 18 Earth First! members handed out fliers that accused the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of degrading the land with timber-cutting and forest roads. At <LOCATION> Eureka </LOCATION>, about a dozen members protested for about three hours, focusing on the `` GO-Road'' that runs for a portion through the forest from <PERSON> Gasquet </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Construction of an incompleted portion has been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after a lengthy court fight. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, about two dozen members of Earth First! dressed as trees during a demonstration at the Federal Building downtown to protest the cutting of timber on public lands. About 30 Earth First! members demonstrated in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> outside the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baker-Snoqualmie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> office, including yet another protester in a Smokey outfit and another decked out as <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Unterwegner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, said about 100 protesters chanted and marched on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> regional office there.

<HEAD>City Crew Donates Money So Woman Can Keep Water Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POMPANO BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four crewmen on a utility truck were sent to <PERSON> Bertha </PERSON> <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON>'s rundown house to disconnect her water, but instead they chipped in to help pay her overdue bill of $ 103.44. Ms. <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON>, 80, lives with her granddaughter, a diabetic amputee who requires kidney dialysis three times a week. They had fallen behind on their bills, even before someone stole their monthly Social Security checks from the mailbox three weeks ago. `` There was something very special about her,'' crew member <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. `` We just could n't leave her in that condition.'' `` I had $ 25 in my pocket,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, another crew member. `` She needed it badder than I did.'' The crew had shut off the water and driven a half-mile away before turning back to do their good deed Thursday. `` It brought tears to my eyes,'' Ms. <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON> said. `` With the condition we was in, I do n't know what we would have done.'' Ms. <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON> said her money problems began after the death of her husband, <PERSON> Izell </PERSON>, last June. She and her granddaughter, <PERSON> Mercedine </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, 37, have a monthly income of $ 952. The city crew, which shuts off the water of dozens of delinquent customers in a typical week, was struck by Ms. <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON>'s understanding attitude `` She just asked for a minute to fill up the bathtub and a few pots and pans,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` It really touched me.'' The crew came up with about $ 50 and radioed City Hall to ask if it would be enough to restore service. After some debate, officials agreed. In the meantime, five co-workers heard the chatter over the radio and donated enough to pay the rest of her water bill. `` I've never heard the guys talk like that before,'' said <PERSON> Bennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a department supervisor who gave $ 33.44. `` I knew she must be worth it.''

<TEXT>
 Members of community organizations that promote minority hiring banded together to extort payoffs from contractors by threatening to stop or disrupt work, authorities charged. `` They wanted their wallets stuffed,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. `` This was not a civil rights movement, as far we can tell.'' He announced Thursday that 13 people, most of them leaders and associates of the minority organizations, were charged with extorting more than $ 112,000 since 1981. Nine were charged with conspiracy to commit extortion and four with extortion. The charges resulted in part from a seven-year-old undercover investigation which included the formation of a contracting company run by agents, said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Frawley </PERSON>, commissioner of the city Department of Investigation. A portion of the payoffs was provided by the undercover agents with city funds, <PERSON> Frawley </PERSON> said. That money was not recovered. <PERSON> Frawley </PERSON> said that during the investigation some of the defendants told undercover officers, `` This is not about jobs here, this is about money.'' <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> noted that the government was not alleging wrongdoing by any organization, but rather that the individual members abused their positions. The defendants were allegedly affiliated with five groups identified as Free At Last, <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, FAIR, <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> Fight Back. Ten of the 13 defendants were arrested Wednesday and Thursday. The other three remain at large. If convicted, the defendants would face a maximum sentence of 20 years in jail. The indictment charges that certain organization members demanded a total of $ 100,000 in payoffs, which frequently took the form of wages to be paid for a no-show `` labor coordinator,'' from numerous construction sites. If the demands were not met, the defendants threatened demonstrations or use of force to disrupt or stop work at the sites, the indictment charged.

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry is suing <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> to regain money in a trust account that was promised to her in exchange for her silence about a 1980 sexual encounter with former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. The financially troubled television ministry says in a lawsuit filed this week in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> broke her part of the bargain by talking publicly about the encounter that led to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s downfall. The suit also seeks reimbursement of any excess legal fees paid to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Furstman </PERSON>, who managed the trust fund for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Furstman </PERSON> has agreed to that, the suit said. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, contacted by telephone at the Playboy mansion in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said Thursday she does n't want the money. But she said she wants to make sure it's used properly. She said <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> lawyers have told her about $ 160,000 remains in the account. She said she refused the attorneys' request that she sign a contract returning the money to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would like to do what is right,'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. `` But at this point I do n't know if what they're doing is right. ... I did n't know if it was in my best interest to sign something like this `` I fell for this once and I'm not going to fall for it twice, signing something I do n't know what I was signing.'' In November 1984, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> signed a document recanting accusations against <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. But she said she was forced into signing it and that a former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board member gave her $ 10,000 after she did. The trust account was formed in February 1985 after <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> reasserted her complaints. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay her $ 115,000 in cash and to establish a trust fund of $ 150,000. She was to receive monthly interest payments from the fund for 20 years, after which she would receive the principal. In return, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> agreed not to speak publicly about her tryst with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. The lawsuit claims <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> paid <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> $ 1 million for her story and photographs. It concludes that `` by virtue of the terms of the settlement agreement and <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s decision to publicize for financial gain her version of the Dec. 6, 1980 incident ... the funds in the <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> Trust ... should be restored to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in their entirety.'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> disputed <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s contention that she had broken her promise. She said evangelist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, who assumed control of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned in March 1987, cut off payments to her in April 1987.

 The man who threatened to free a 500-pound <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> tiger on the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus snapped from pressure but deserves compassion, says basketball Coach <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> signed the $ 10,000 bail bond Thursday to free <PERSON> Moacyr </PERSON> `` Gato'' Cezar, 48, who locked himself in the outer cage of the <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> mascot Wednesday and remained for four hours, threatening to free the tiger unless he got a job. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, a basketball player from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, talked Cezar out of the cage. Cezar, of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, had been serving as a supervisor of the <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> basketball dormitory for room and board while taking courses to improve his English. <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON> was never in danger from the tiger, a 13-year-old named <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>. `` What happened to Gato could have happened to any of us. His personal problems were overwhelming and he snapped,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told a news conference after <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON> was freed from jail and taken to a hospital for psychiatric testing. The <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> district attorney's office said no final decision had been made on charges, but that consideration would be given to the fact that the university itself does not plan to press charges. `` The doctor says he is OK and he will soon return to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and an uncertain future,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, adding that <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON> plans to return home voluntarily. <PERSON> Cezar </PERSON> was befriended by the globetrotting <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> last summer in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>. `` He wanted to come back and learn English and more about basketball.'' Cezar's temporary visa was expiring, he wanted a work permit and just could n't take the pressure anymore, said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. At one point, some of the students who watch the man in the cage chanted, `` Tiger bait! Tiger bait!'' _ the cry used at <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> sporting events when opposing teams enter. `` To those of you who shouted ` Tiger bait,' what can I say?'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` May you never experience sadness and loneliness, and may you find a love that you could n't give last night.''

 <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> member who has been reported to be in politcal trouble, took part in a Kremlin gala today. There have been reports and rumors <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> was reprimanded and demoted for opposing <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform policies. At an evening gathering of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership to mark the 118th anniversary of the birth of Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> filed into the crowded auditorium of the Palace of Congresses in his rightful place. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, considered the country's No. 2 leader, followed General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> sat together at the front of the huge hall and engaged in animated conversation throughout a speech by candidate member of the Politburo <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON>. The speech was shown on national television. Rumors have been spread around the capital this week that <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> was reprimanded by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at an extraordinary meeting of the 13-man Politburo and stripped of responsibility for ideology and personnel matters _ the tasks usually assigned to the second-in-command. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, in today's editions, quoted unnamed Soviet officials as saying <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> was all but removed as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 leader. But the party ideologist traditionally follows the premier in the official lineup and <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> appeared after <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> during the gala. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, 67, thought to be more conservative than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, reportedly believes glasnost, or <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness, has gone too far in denouncing most of the economic and social policies of the past. Because of the the rumors and reports, the gala was watched to see if <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, who some said was on a long vacation, would show up. The formal arena for changing duties among party secretaries would be at a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenum. But if <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> were in serious political trouble, he would likely take a lower profile until the next plenary meeting. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> told reporters toay that `` there has been no change in the distribution of duties,'' when asked about official, though anonymous, claims that <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> stepped up to take over <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s role. <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said there had been no shakeup in the leadership, but seemed to add as protection that <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> was on a `` short vacation,'' in the event he did not show up at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> gathering. The alleged internal dispute apparently came to a head over the past month when an article in defense of late dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> was published by the daily <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>, then denounced by the party organ Pravda. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> was rumored to have been behind the pro-Stalin letter, and the Pravda denunciation indicated the party had defined that theme as beyond the limits of glasnost. Despite the much-touted campaign to bring the problems of life to the forefront, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media never name names when referring to high-level resistance to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. The official silence leaves observers to the counsel of sources who often seek to present the internal conflicts in a light favorable to the official of their liking. Editors and other officials who have periodic contact with top party officials have been giving conflicting hints to Westerners about the fate of <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, a stocky, white-haired figure with a booming voice.

 The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said today the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential campaign is shaping up as a battle between Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. An analysis written by <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> <PERSON> Guanfren </PERSON> said the Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has the advantage of an early grip on his nomination by `` an essentially united party'' while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' nomination as the Democratic candidate is likely but not yet assured. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` can benefit from a rather sound economy, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> heritage of lowering inflation and unemployment, negotiating new arms agreements with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and his experience in government and foreign affairs,'' it said. `` However, staying for more than seven years under the tutelage of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, he has had little in the way of his own record. His loyalty to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has earned him the bad reputation of ` wimp,' and the Iran-Contra scandal is still shadowing him. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has even more troubles. His nomination is very likely but still not as assured as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s. Whether -LRB- <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> gives him the freedom to pick the kind of running mate he really wants is still a problem. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was unknown nationally six months ago after nine years as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. His only legacy is as the architect of the ` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle,' and he uses his state as an example of the economic development, housing and education reforms he promises for the nation. `` His front-runner status has been achieved not through overwhelming support but through a general feeling among Democrats that, ` Ho hum, there's no one better.'''

 Nearly nine years after a boy was stabbed to death outside <LOCATION> Yankee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> when he refused to give up his new bicycle and basketball, police say a suspect has been arrested. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozada </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, was picked out of a lineup Thursday by several witnesses to the 1979 murder of 12-year-old Tireak Ghandy. `` This case really bothered a lot of people,'' said Detective <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> of the 44th Precinct. `` Some of them said they lived with it too long.'' Witnesses had told police at the time that they saw a boy of about 16 stab <PERSON> Ghandy </PERSON> once in the chest at 8:30 p.m. on July 30, 1979, on the pedestrian mall at the stadium. He then pulled the ball from <PERSON> Ghandy </PERSON>'s hands and took the bicycle. A break in the case came when a man under arrest provided a name during routine questioning. Then, for 18 months, <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> and Detective <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> went through the painstaking task of tracking down the witnesses, many of whom had moved. <PERSON> Lozada </PERSON> was arrested Wednesday night while visiting his parole officer and charged with second-degree murder, first-degree robbery and possession of a deadly weapon, police said. He had served three years in state prison for possession of stolen property. `` Even from the beginning all the detectives who worked on it, their hearts went out to the mother because she was so nice and so hard-working,'' <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> said. `` He was her only child.''

<HEAD>Magazine Says French Hostages In Lebanon To Be Released Soon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The weekly magazine <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON> said today that contacts were under way between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the release of three Frenchmen held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A West German television station, meanwhile, reported that Western diplomats negotiating with the kidnappers of Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were making progress in efforts to win the captives' release. <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> had agreed on the release of two French hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in return for `` the release of Iranian assets frozen in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in addition to a $ 1 billion compensation to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' The magazine apparently was referring to full repayment of a billion-dollar loan made by the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and disputed interest which could amount to an additional billion dollars. `` Last minute snags delayed the release,'' the magazine said without further elaboration. There had been reports of an imminent French hostage release earlier this month. But the April 5 hijack of a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner by Shiite extremists apparently delayed the negotiations. <PERSON> Ash </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiraa </PERSON> aslo indicated that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s insistance on the release of a third French hostage was delaying implementation of the alleged deal. `` The deal -LRB- to release the two -RRB- was not carried out pending completion of negotiations for the release of a third French hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' the report said. It did not disclose further details. The magazine <ORGANIZATION> Ash-Shiraa </ORGANIZATION> gained international fame when it broke the story of secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1986. The pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, a group of Lebanese Shiite extremists, holds French diplomats <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> in addition to journalist <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufmann </PERSON>. The three were kidnapped in 1985 in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The West German SAT 1 television station, quoting unidentified sources, also said that missing <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> was being held in a <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> school cellar, guarded by Iranian diplomatic employees. Western diplomats are negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-Iranian radical Shiite Moslem group believed to be holding Western hostages, SAT 1 said. It said progress was being made, especially in the case of <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, who is reported to be seriously ill. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, a West German businessman, was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in January 1987 Aother West German, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, was kidnapped days later but was released last September. Twenty-two foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped March 16, 1985. He has been held the longest.

 Human bones discovered in the ceiling of a downtown 19th century building came from more than one body and may be as old as the building, authorities said. `` I would n't say that unless I was quite sure,'' said <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner Dr. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, who conducted a preliminary examination of the bones found by a construction crew. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said Thursday that he found duplicate bones which could not have come from the same body, although that's about all he was able to tell. The bones, a shoulder blade and parts of legs and arms, will be sent to <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> to be examined by forensic anthropologist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Onondaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner's office. `` When you start talking about the co-mingling of individuals it gets a little complicated,'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. `` So we need someone who has some expertise in this area.'' That examination is expected to take a few weeks, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>, a worker for E.J.M. Excavating, made the first discovery _ part of a leg and foot _ while he and other workers were pulling down a ceiling Wednesday. `` It was very intact, toes, toenail, skin on the toe. ... It was just like spooky, sort of ghoulish, like you found somebody's grave,'' <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said the bones retained some `` mummified soft tissue.'' Workers have not discovered a skull or rib cage. Police believe they've found all the bones that could have been in the building.

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today `` I think it would be a tragedy'' if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoes the major trade bill heading for passage in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, at a rally at a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> plant, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said the bill `` is the right thing to do and it's the fair thing to do.'' It would be tragic, he told reporters at the airport, if the bill were vetoed `` because of a mild plant-closing provision.'' The bill, which won easy <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passage Thursday and seems destined for similar <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action next week, would overhaul the nation's foreign trade laws. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Thursday he will veto it if it arrives on his desk with a provision to require all but the smallest employers to give 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said a notification law in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> had helped his state save 20,000 jobs by enabling government officials to be aware of business problems and to work to resolve them. Thursday night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, acting ever more like the Democratic presidential nominee, said he would n't have a White House spokesman who makes up presidential quotes `` as he goes along.'' That was a reference to former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, who admitted making up quotes for the president. The front-running Democrat, looking to follow his <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> victory with another win Tuesday in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and the week after in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, hit on the themes of rebuilding <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s industrial base as he toured the country's industrial heartland `` Over the past decade, in communities all over <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, we've seen the same kind of pain and agony and uncertainty that we lived through in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> during the'50s and'60s and early'70s,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> on Thursday night. `` I've seen what happens when good, decent, hard-working people lose their jobs.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> emphasized his themes of reinvesting in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, support for plant-closing legislation and increased excellence in education as he planned to visit a Ford plant near <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> today and a steel mill in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` We're going to encourage management and labor to work together, not as enemies but as allies, to out-hustle, out-produce, out-sell and out-compete every nation on earth,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> politician has opened up a lead over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the only remaining active rival for the nomination, in The Associated Press delegate count in the past two weeks. His big victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> sparked talk that the nomination is all but his. In his <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> speech during a campaign day marred by plane breakdowns, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> to task for making up quotes for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on at least two occasions. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> revealed the actions in his just-published book `` Speaking Out.'' The furor over the disclosure cost <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> his public relations job at a Wall Street firm. `` I have a quaint policy as governor: no press release will ever go out of my office in my name without me reviewing it first,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` If I'm ever president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, I can assure you I will have a press secretary that reports on what I say and does not compose things as he goes along.'' He added: `` And I ca n't imagine having a press secretary who was feeding quotes to the press that I had n't uttered and approved.'' As he has in the past week, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> directed his fire at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, not at <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` We have a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and an <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- that wo n't stand up for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because we have got an attorney general who could n't tell the difference between antitrust and antifreeze,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>.

 Rescue ships and planes searched the waters of the north <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> today for survivors of a tanker than broke in half and burst into flames. Hopes that some of the crew escaped the flaming tanker were buoyed when rescue ships reported a life raft was missing from the ship, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. Authorities do not know the origin of the tanker, what it was carrying or how many people were on board. `` They are scouring the area around both sections looking for survivors,'' said Petty Officer <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Apparently both sections, although they are in flames, appear to be floating.'' The research ship <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> spotted the burning tanker at about midnight, 370 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Race </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, the Search and Rescue Co-ordination Center in <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, reported. The <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> joined by an Italian ship, the <ORGANIZATION> Italica </ORGANIZATION>, in looking for survivors, officials said. Two Canadian <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> patrol aircraft were joining the search, Canadian officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> also dispatched a plane and <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> fisheries patrol vessel Cape <PERSON> Rober </PERSON> was steaming into the area. An earlier report that an empty lifeboat was seen floating nearby was erroneous, according to the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>'s commanding officer, <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> said. `` We do n't know the size, how many people on board, or even the name'' of the tanker, said Lt. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Selley </PERSON>, also at the operations center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> has not reported any pollution in the waters around the tanker. In April 1987, the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> dropped scientific work to become involved in a dramatic rescue off the coast of <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>. The ship's crew saved the 24-man crew of the sinking Skipper I, a Panamanian-registered freighter.

<TEXT>
 Large numbers of Contras have been retreating across the Nicaraguan border into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> because of an acute food shortage in rebel camps in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, a leader of the insurgent forces said today. No <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid has been sent to the insurgents in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> since Feb. 29, and $ 47.9 million in humanitarian aid approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can not be delivered to rebel forces there until Contra and Sandinista negotiators make progress in cease-fire talks. A breakthrough is not expected before next month because the talks have been suspended until April 28. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, a member of the Contra political leadership, told reporters the number of rebels on the Honduran side of the border has swelled in recent weeks to 3,000 to 4,000 because of the food shortages in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. It was not clear, however, how many rebels were in that area prior to the recent exodus from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Rebel forces in jungle and mountainous regions in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> face `` a very difficult situation,'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said. He added that the troops will be ordered to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> once U.S.-sponsored food shipments inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> begin. The food situation in Contra camps on the Honduran side of the border improved this week with the delivery of 69,000 tons of rice, beans and other items acquired with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid money, an Agency for <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> official told reporters Thursday. The shipments were sent from the Honduran capital of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> after being inspected by independent observers, including Honduran clergymen, to ensure that the deliveries contained no lethal equipment, the official said. The legislation approving the aid package barred military aid to the Contras. The official, who insisted on anonymity, said that based on talks he had last week with Contra leaders, the food situation for the estimated 12,000 rebels stationed inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> `` is getting very desperate.'' Another official said `` more than a few hundred'' Contras have crossed the border into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> over the past several weeks to escape the food shortages in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Many of those still in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> are beginning to sell off what few assets they have for food while others are buying on credit, promising merchants repayment once deliveries begin on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid package approved three weeks ago, the official said. The Sandinistas and the Contras reached a temporary truce last March 23 that allows for humanitarian aid for the rebels once they are settled in seven mutually agreed cease-fire zones. But talks on establishing ground rules for the zones are at an impasse, leaving rebel forces in a precarious position. The official said there are one or two known instances in which rebels have used their weapons to take food, and more such incidents can be expected if the talks drag on inconclusively. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have a big advantage because, in contrast to the rebels, the government is able to feed its troops without restrictions, he said. `` The playing field is n't quite level in this negotiation,'' the official added. Asked whether the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, mindful of Contra food shortages, are using delaying tactics in the negotiations, the official said, `` Not yet. But if it ... drags on, you're going to have to raise that question.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> imposed an aid cutoff on Feb. 29 but approved the humanitarian aid package after the breakthrough in the <LOCATION> Sandinista-Contra </LOCATION> talks a month ago. The package contains $ 17.7 million for food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies and medical services. The remainder is earmarked for treating children who are victims of the war and for verifying compliance with the agreement. The Sandinstas and the Contras are trying to reach agreement not only on ground rules for cease-fire zones but also terms for a permanent peace settlement.

 Oscar-winning screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond, who collaborated with director <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> on some of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s most popular films, has died at age 67. Diamond, who won an Oscar in 1960 for the screenplay `` The Apartment,'' died Thursday at his <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home of cancer. His longtime agent, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON>, said Diamond had been ailing for several months. <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> said he introduced Diamond to <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, launching a 30-year partnership that produced some of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s most memorable movies, starting in 1957 with `` Love in the Afternoon,'' which starred <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>. Diamond's work with <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> also included `` Some Like It Hot,'' with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>; `` The Apartment'' which featured <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON>; and `` The Fortune Cookie,'' which teamed <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> with <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthau </PERSON>. Diamond and <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> collaborated on the 1974 remake of <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>'s classic <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> newspaper tale, `` The Front Page,'' which again teamed <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matthau </PERSON>. Besides his Academy Award for `` The Apartment,'' Diamond also received Oscar nominations for `` Some Like it Hot'' and `` The Fortune Cookie.'' He also wrote the 1969 screen adaptation of `` Cactus Flower'' under the name <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> once remarked of his longtime collaborator, `` If I ever lost this guy, I'd feel like Abercrombie without <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON>.'' Born Itek Dommnici in <LOCATION> Ungheni </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, on June 27, 1920, <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at age 9. He adopted the pen name I.A.L. Diamond _ the initials stood for <ORGANIZATION> Interscholastic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Algebra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in reference to his early interest in mathematics. As a youth, he won a three-state math competition that sent him to <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he majored in math. At <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, he wrote four annual student revues and edited the university paper, said his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> brought Diamond to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in 1940. His first screen credit came four years later for `` Murder in the Blue Room.'' In later years, <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> was critical of writers he said only used the profession as a stepping stone to the director's chair. `` There are no writers left in this business,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> last year. `` There are only would-be directors -LRB- who -RRB- have learned that the best way to get a crack at directing ... is to write a script. But most do n't have the vaguest talent as writers. `` They see writing as a phase they have to pass through, like adolescent acne.'' In addition to his wife, Diamond is survived by a son, a daughter and one grandchild.

<HEAD>Reporter's Multiple Registration Will Not Be Prosecuted</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Prosecutors have decided not to file charges against a <ORGANIZATION> WCBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> reporter who registered several times for this week's primary election to demonstrate the potential for vote fraud. Reporter <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevins </PERSON> said Wednesday night she had registered to vote in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> using a series of names and friends' addresses. She said she voted only once. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolen </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION>, who was interviewed by Ms. <PERSON> Nevins </PERSON>, said she referred the case to prosecutors because it is illegal to give false information to election officials or to register falsely. The <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> district attorney's office decided Thursday not to file charges against Ms. <PERSON> Nevins </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McKelvey </PERSON>, spokesman for District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> criticized the board for seeking prosecution of Ms. <PERSON> Nevins </PERSON>. `` A reporter's duty is to alert the public to the realities of life,'' he said. `` Killing the messenger does not negate the message. `` The board should determine whether the potential for fraud _ multiple registration and voting _ is enough to require changes in the system. ... Seeking to prosecute the reporter is unjustified and darn foolish.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dolen </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Nevins </PERSON> admitted in her news report that she had committed Class E felonies. `` What she did is against the law and I gave it to the district attorney,'' she said. `` I was disturbed by the attempt to prosecute me,'' Ms. <PERSON> Nevins </PERSON> said. `` I thought the response was inappropriate. When we showed Mrs. <PERSON> Dolen </PERSON> a flaw in the system, the response should have been, ` There's something wrong; let's fix it.' Instead, she turned the tables and pointed a finger at me.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dolen </PERSON> said fraudulent registration is rare, but cautioned that breaking the law on television could encourage others to do it. `` I told her, ` If you go on television, people who have never thought about doing something like this will think about doing so.' I think she's really out of line,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Nevins </PERSON>' report did not suggest that widespread fraud was committed in Tuesday's primary, but stressed that a campaign to rig a local election might work.

<HEAD>Psychiatrist Curbs Violence on Children's TV Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The `` Captain Power'' cartoon series, television's first `` interactive'' program, has hired a psychiatrist in response to concerns the syndicated show is too violent for young viewers. The interactive format of `` Captain Power,'' which has been criticized by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violence </ORGANIZATION>, allows children to `` shoot'' villains by aiming a special toy gun at bright orange dots on the screen. Psychiatrist <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> was retained by `` Captain Power'' Executive Producer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> after she independently studied the program and complained about its violent content. `` When you have a high action show, it's important to balance the action and adventure with an awareness that our audience includes young viewers,'' <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> said. `` Captain Power'' was the top-rated weekly children's syndicated series during the November 1987 sweeps period, according to <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and is the fourth-rated overall children's syndicated program. It is currently seen in more than 200 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets and 46 foreign countries. `` The image of a kid coming home to an empty house, sitting in a dark room and shooting at a television set is a very disturbing one,'' said <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, who has served as a psychiatric script consultant on more than 100 TV and movie productions. `` There are studies, 43 out of 47 to be exact, that show when a child is exposed to violent toys or media, the child becomes more aggressive in the period of time following,'' she said. <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> said the studies also found the more aggressive a child is when he is young, the more likely he will stay that way as a teen-ager and as an adult. `` There are great implications from this exposure to violence.'' Upon reviewing scripts and tapes of the show, <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> _ to her admitted surprise _ discovered many `` positive things'' about the series. She noted the program demonstrated `` teamwork and values,'' particularly in each episode's secondary storyline. The psychiatrist suggested that the orange dot targets be moved as often as possible away from the bodies of the villains to inanimate objects, such as computer pads. This allows children to `` do something productive'' in aiding Captain Power's fight for good rather than promoting violence against others, she said. <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> also said the series will be decreasing the amount and length of violence by trimming the running time of the battle scenes. `` My role in ` Captain <PERSON> Power </PERSON>' is not that of a censor,'' insisted <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>. `` I want to work with the writers and creative team to enhance the characters. Human elements and positive stories do n't have to take a second place to action, nor do you have to sacrifice any excitement.

Freshman <PERSON> Ginevra </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> complained that <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> called her a `` black bitch'' on March 7 when she talked to him about withdrawing from his class. <PERSON> Towery </PERSON>, a tenured professor who has taught at the school for 18 years, was suspended with pay pending an investigation of the matter. <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, an 18-year-old psychology major from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, had accused him of being a racist when he refused to let her withdraw from his class with a passing grade instead of a failing grade. A faculty committee investigated the incident and presented its report to Capitan on April 8. A fellow faculty member who overheard the March 7 exchange told school officials in a letter that <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> refused to let Ms. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> withdraw with a passing grade because she had a failing average on her essays. Ms. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> of racism, but he denied the accusation and their conversation became `` increasingly heated,'' said the letter from associate professor <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Litwhiler </PERSON>. She acknowledged that she heard <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> make the racial remark, but said she believed it was made `` in a state of obvious exasperation.''

 Hundreds of Moslem worshipers vowing to avenge the death of a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader clashed with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers today after prayers at mosques in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Israeli troops killed one Arab and wounded 10. Six Arabs were hit by rubber bullets and five police injured by stones in the clash inside the compound of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s sacred Dome of the Rock and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosques, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio and witnesses said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> town of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, 25, died of a gunshot wound to the head, <ORGANIZATION> Nassr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Curfews remained in effect today in 22 refugee camps and cities in the occupied territories, affecting some 400,000 Palestinian residents. The army also barred <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> residents of the territories from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for a third straight day to try to curb violence on the Moslem Sabbath. Journalists also were banned from entering most parts of the territories, occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since 1967. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes raided <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla bases south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today, Lebanese police and the Israeli army reported. The police said the main targets of the attack were guerrilla bases near the town of <LOCATION> Barja </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Kharroub </LOCATION> region, 15 miles south of the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> capital. Police said they had no immediate reports of casualties. The army said its planes returned safely to base. At least 48 people have been killed and 63 wounded in the five previous Israeli raids since Jan. 3. The army also said today that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and Israeli-allied militiamen killed six guerrillas in two clashes in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Wednesday. One militiaman was killed. About 200 Palestinian youths emerged from noon prayers at the <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Omari </LOCATION> mosque in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, throwing rocks at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops, Arab witnesses said. `` Youths gather, gather because <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> sacrificed his blood,'' they chanted. The Palestinians were protesting the killing of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military commander <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wazir </PERSON>, known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, who was gunned down at his home in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, Saturday last week. A Tunisian government report blames <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for killing <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Israeli sources also have confirmed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carried out the assassination. Troops hurled tear gas canisters and fired live ammunition into the air to disperse the crowd. In the nearby <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, troops opened fire on rock-throwing <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> protesters outside a mosque after noon prayers, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. Hospital officials said 10 Palestinians were wounded, including a 9-year-old boy struck in the left hip and right arm. The army said it was checking the report. On the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> about 10,000 Palestinians attended services at the <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aqsa </ORGANIZATION> and Dome of the Rock mosques, where the prayer leader urged the crowd to persist in protests against the Israelis. After services, hundreds of worshipers carrying black banners of mourning and outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags hurled rocks at a police station outside the mosques. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio and witnesses said the police fired rubber bullets, hitting six Arabs and five officers were injured. `` With our spirit and our blood, we will avenge <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>,'' shouted some of the protesters. The clash on <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, known in Arabic as <LOCATION> Harim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> es-Sharif </LOCATION>, or Noble Enclosure, was the most serious since Jan. 15 when riot police fired tear gas on the compound. In that incident, 80 to 100 Palestinians were treated for the effects of tear gas, and one police officer was knifed. According to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> orders contained in an underground leaflet, today and Sunday were set aside as days of prayer for <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, and Saturday is to be a `` Day of Rage.'' The leaflets bearing <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s picture ordered Palestinians to step up attacks with `` stones, petrol bombs, metal balls and slingshots'' to avenge the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader's death. Since the Dec. 8 start of the anti-occupation protests, 169 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed. Today's death was not included in the toll.

<BYLINE>By LAURA KING</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, now in a one-on-one fight for the Democratic presidential nomination, worked to win labor support in the industrial states of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> today, with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declaring `` it would be a tragedy'' if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoes a major trade bill. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, alone in the race after Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> dropped out Thursday, were to meet tonight in a debate in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, four days before the big <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at a rally at a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, today that the foreign trade bill is `` the right thing to do and it's the fair thing to do.'' It would be tragic, he told reporters later at the airport, if the bill were vetoed because of a `` mild plant-closing provision.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said he will veto the bill if it arrives on his desk with a provision to require all but the smallest employers to give 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. On Thursday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> both aimed new criticism at embattled Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> abandoned his presidential bid on Thursday, vowing to do all he could to help put a Democrat in the White House. `` The nominee is going to be <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. I'm going to do everything I can to help them. ... The only man I want to stop is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference, with his family at his side. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator suspended his campaign, technically remaining a candidate to permit his delegates to attend the Democratic National Convention. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who had not won a primary or caucus since Super Tuesday, March 8, ended his effort more than $ 1.5 million in debt. On the Republican side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was coping with the kind of scheduling glitch that either of his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rivals would envy _ it looked as if he would clinch the number of delegates needed to nominate a little sooner than his staff had thought. Aides to the vice president had been planning to celebrate the big moment on May 3, the date of primaries in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. But they made it clear that the development would be more than welcome whenever it came. Delegate counts maintained by both The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign indicated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could secure the 1,139 needed to nominate in the next few days. He now has 1,058 to 17 for <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s only remaining rival, according to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> count. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Republicans were selecting 15 delegates this week; <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Republicans will choose another 20 on Saturday. And there are 78 delegates at stake in Tuesday's <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary. `` At this point it's pretty much concluded. ... The race is over,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said Thursday in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. Even though he has given up on the nomination, the former television evangelist expressed determination to make his mark on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, his supporters were dominating the state convention and bidding for top state party posts. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was campaigning today in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where polls have suggested he is running well behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In Tuesday's primary, 178 delegates are at stake. `` I always run against great odds,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Campaigning in the northwestern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> courted blue-collar workers with a call for `` economic justice.'' `` Profits are up, wages are down, factories are closing, and workers are abandoned,'' he told a crowd of about 4,000 people in a downtown park who braved a cold wind off nearby <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>. `` Let's rebuild <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and put the workers back to work. ... Do n't let the voices of the status quo break your spirit,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He also called for changes in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, saying it should be a mediation service and not `` a strike-breaking board.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also renewed his criticism of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who is the target of a yearlong criminal investigation and under pressure from some quarters to quit. The attorney general said Thursday there is no factor he knows of `` right now that would cause me to resign.'' `` I want a Justice Department that stands for justice ... an attorney general that goes back and forth to court as a prosecutor for the people and not as a defender for himself,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> slammed <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> as he campaigned in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> on Thursday. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s primary follows <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s by a week, and offers 159 delegates. Like <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> highlighted labor issues. He was visiting an auto plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and a steel plant in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> today. `` We have a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and an <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- that wo n't stand up for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because we have got an attorney general who could n't tell the difference between antitrust and antifreeze,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, bidding for blue-collar support, added: `` We're going to pass a strong plant-closing law that will give our workers the notice, the training and the benefits they need to find new jobs with good wages when plants shut down.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also made his trademark anti-drug appeal as he campaigned in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Accompanied by Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, he walked through a neighborhood notorious for drug sales and sounded his familiar `` down with dope, up with hope'' theme. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were neck-and-neck in national poll results released today by <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> and Cable News Network. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got 45 percent support to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 43 percent _ a difference that fell within the survey's 3.3 percentage point margin of error. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lost support when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was listed as his running-mate, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> getting 49 percent support to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s 42 percent. The survey of 900 voters was conducted after Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary.

<HEAD>Teen-Ager Faces Trial As a Juvenile for Four Ax Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 16-year-old boy accused of the ax murders of his parents, brother and sister will be tried as a juvenile, a judge ruled today. Olmsted County Judge <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ring </PERSON> denied a state petition to have <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> tried as an adult and ordered that the teen-ager remain in detention until he can be placed in a juvenile detention home in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Olmstead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON> said he would appeal the ruling to the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. Brom has been charged with murdering his parents, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON>, and siblings <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>, at the family's <LOCATION> Cascade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> home Feb. 18 For a juvenile to be tried as an adult in a criminal case, state law requires the prosecutor to show that the child is not suited to treatment and is a danger to the community. The judge said neither standard was met in the Brom case. `` I think the facts speak for themselves in terms of his dangerousness,'' <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON> said. If tried as an adult and found guilty of first-degree murder, <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> would have been sentenced to life in prison with parole eligibility in about 17 -LCB- years. Under the juvenile court system, if he is found guilty he will be released when he turns 19 or when he has been rehabilitated, whichever comes first. In a 20-page memorandum accompanying his ruling, the judge called the case `` one of the most perplexing cases I have been involved with in my 16 years as a judge. `` I am faced with a crime which the prosecution has described as one of the most vicious and brutal, multiple murders in the history of the state,'' Ring wrote. `` At the same time I have an accused who is a child of 16 years, with no prior court record, and who is described -LRB- by a court-appointed psychiatrist -RRB- as quite deferential, polite, and compliant.'' Ring said he assumed at the beginning of the court proceedings that Brom would probably be certified as an adult. `` In this case, there was no lack of proof that the crime was terrible. The evidence was graphic and plentiful,'' the judge wrote. `` However, the evidence as to the child was totally different. `` He was normally funny, to a point of being a problem at times in class,'' Ring said in his ruling. `` He was never aggressive or assaultive to anyone's recollection. When slapped by his father, he did not fight back, even when knocked over a table. He did not exhibit any signs to most of those who knew him that he could do the awful things that he apparently did.'' At a recent reference hearing, psychiatrist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Malmquist </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> suffers from severe depression. He also told the court that there is no assurance treatment could be complete by the time he is 19. However, psychologist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbertson </PERSON> said the teen could be successfully treated for his depression within that time frame. Even if he is not treated, <PERSON> Gilbertson </PERSON> said, the boy would pose no risk to the general public in almost all circumstances.

<HEAD>Blacks End 10-Week Boycott Over Coach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROOKHAVEN, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Black leaders say they will end a 10-week boycott of white-owned businesses now that the school board has decided to reassign a controversial football coach and athletic director. <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutter </PERSON>, hired from a white private academy, was reassigned as administrative assistant to the superintendent after the board voted 4-1 in a special meeting Thursday. He also was given a two-year contract extension. `` We achieved but none of us has won anything,'' the Rev. O.D. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, spokesman for a group called Concerned Citizens, told about 250 jubilant protesters after the five-hour board meeting. `` We've all got to live here together,'' he said. `` We've all got to heal the wounds. We've got to inflict wounds to achieve something. It's going to take several weeks to get it down where the pot's not boiling.'' The board had previously voted 4-1 in support of <PERSON> Rutter </PERSON>. Superintendent <PERSON> Goerge </PERSON> <PERSON> Brumfield </PERSON>, who had vowed Wednesday to ride out the protest, cited a walkout by 197 of the school's 800 students Tuesday as the reason for the sudden turnaround. `` Until the students walked out this week, I had no intention and Coach <PERSON> Rutter </PERSON> had no intention of changing our minds,'' <PERSON> Brumfield </PERSON> said after the meeting. Reading from a statement, <PERSON> Brumfield </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rutter </PERSON> `` thought when the protest first started it would only be for a short duration and not cause a disruption of the school system and the community. That proved to be incorrect.'' Blacks initiated the boycott when <PERSON> Rutter </PERSON> was hired at the primarily black school in January after spending the previous two years at all-white <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. Originally, the boycott called for black students to boycott extracurricular activities, but it later was expanded to a general boycott of white-owned businesses. Spring football training, held in February or March by most schools, was moved to April 25 in an effort to weather the boycott. <PERSON> Rutter </PERSON> acknowledged that two of three black baseball players who started the season dropped off the team in support of the boycott. Many of the 16-member boys' and 10-member girls' track teams also quit because of the boycott.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee today that the <PERSON> Cosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Nostra </PERSON> is `` on the run'' in his city, with most of the organized crime leadership under indictment or in prison. However, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said that despite the successful prosecutions, the mob is `` down but not out'' in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on Investigations, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said of his city's organized crime family, `` I do n't think it will pass from the scene very easily or very quickly.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> described how the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Cosa Nostra turned increasingly violent after the murder of its former chieftain, <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, who was shot to death outside his home on March 21, 1980. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>'s assassination led to a series of mob murders and subsequent prosecutions and convictions. The reputed current boss of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> family, <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, was convicted on extortion and conspiracy charges and sentenced in August 1987 to 14 years in prison. He is on trial in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, along with seven <PERSON> Cosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Nostra </PERSON> members, on charges of killing a former `` capo'' in the Scarfo organized crime family. `` We certainly have the Mafia on the run in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and elsewhere,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said. At present, most active members of the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia-South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nostra </ORGANIZATION> `` are either under indictment, in custody, or both. If successful, this series of prosecutions could effectively remove the <ORGANIZATION> LCN </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- La Cosa Nostra -RRB- from criminal activity -LRB- in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> -RRB- for at least the immediate future,'' he said. Government crime fighters from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> told the subcommittee earlier that organized crime is no longer dominated by gangsters of Italian origin, but by a `` more deadly mixture of other ethnic immigrants.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zazzali </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>, told senators Thursday that of 29 organized crime organizations operating in his state, `` only seven of these are Mafia gangs.'' <PERSON> Zazzali </PERSON> said that `` the problem of newly emerging groups in 5-to-10 years may be the major problem in organized crime.'' `` What we are experiencing now in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, indeed in every metropolitan area of this nation _ is an evolution of organized crime from domination largely by gangsters of Sicilian or other Italian origin since the 1930s to an even more deadly mixture of other ethnic immigrants,'' he said. The groups include <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> blacks, Asians, Colombians, Cubans, Jamaicans and Russians, said <PERSON> Zazzali </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstock </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. Motorcycle gangs have also become a force in organized crime, they said. <PERSON> Goldstock </PERSON> said that even now, the `` Colombian drug cartels are a much greater problem than the traditional La Cosa Nostra.'' He said organized crime in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has changed for these reasons: _ Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a radically new approach that allows prosecutors to focus on the illegal enterprise as a crime rather than the individuals who run it Before its enactment in 1970, there was an endless war of attrition in which one mob leader was simply replaced with another. Now, entire upper echelons of families have been indicted and convicted. _ The breakdown of the code of silence by mobsters faced with prosecution, forfeiture of assets and incarceration Several `` elder statesmen'' became media stars, not only through testimony but by writing books such as `` Man of Honor'' by <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnano </PERSON> and `` The Last Mafioso'' by <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> `` The Weasel'' Fratianno. _ Disputes between organized crime groups have grown in number and seriousness as the leadership has become more inexperienced and unstable <PERSON> Goldstock </PERSON> referred to new organized crime leaders as `` mob yuppies,'' to whom financial considerations are more important than the traditional codes of discipline that existed in the old-line organized crime families. `` By the late 1970s, for many family members, traditional values had been replaced by simple cost-benefit analysis,'' he said.

 Japanese leaders reacted sharply today to the approval of an omnibus trade bill by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and urged President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto it quickly. The bill, passed Thursday by a vote of 312-107, targets foreign markets closed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry. `` The government of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will continue to reiterate its apprehension to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side, the administration in particular, hoping strongly that such a bill will not be enacted,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON>, minister for international trade and industry, charged that `` anti-Japanese'' sentiment was behind the action, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON>, in a nationally televised news conference, warned that Japan-U.S. relations and the world economy would suffer if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill. He said, however, `` I have strong expectations that in the final stage the bill will not be passed, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> included.'' The bill, which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was to begin debating Friday, includes two provisions regarded as threatening to Japanese business. One provision gives <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> power to decide what constitutes unfair trade practices by another country, and what to do about it. Another imposes sanctions against <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which sold submarine-silencing equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in violation of a Western trade agreement on sensitive technology exports. <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON>, minister for international trade and industry, said he `` deeply regretted'' passage of the omnibus trade bill. `` I am expecting that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will take veto action,'' he said. `` While I do not think it will be passed in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in the end, I will urge the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration -LRB- to block the bill -RRB- and await the common sense of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON> said. The bill, shorn of many features criticized as too protective of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry, included a controversial item opposed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The provision, which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said will move him to veto the entire bill, called for advance notice in the event of certain plant closings and employee layoffs. But it lacked what for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would have been a more damaging amendment, which would have imposed sanctions against countries that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> judged to have achieved large trade surpluses through unfair means.

 A federal judge ruled that the trademark of <ORGANIZATION> Chili </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appreciation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> belongs to a group that sought stricter rules in the traditional chili championships held at <LOCATION> Terlingua </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lucius </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> refused to get involved in which camp could claim to be the official cookoff of the chili world. <PERSON> Bunon </PERSON>'s ruling Thursday means that the name <ORGANIZATION> Chili </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appreciation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> belongs to a group headed by <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Poteet </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> waxed poetic in his opinion, saying: `` Some like it hot, some like it cold. Some like it in the pot nine days old. When it comes, however, to good, stout chili, if you do n't like it hot you're just plum silly.'' King's group sued the late <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON>, who began the chili cookoff in 1967 that is held in the Big Bend area, complaining that the rules of the cookoff were not specific enough. In 1983, the two camps began holding their own cookoffs on the same day, both flying the banner of the <ORGANIZATION> Chili </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appreciation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> ruled that King had registered the name as a federal trademark and, therefore, <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> had no right to use the name. <ORGANIZATION> CASI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is to pay <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON>'s heirs $ 1,500 for the trademark, but the defendants must pay court costs. No attorneys fees were awarded. <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> found that prior use of the trademark by <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> did not constitute infringement, but that future use by anyone other than the King group would. <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> noted that he has no authority over the parties as to whose cookoff would be the official cookoff of the chili world. `` The parties should see this as an issue of good sense and decency and not look to the courts,'' he said. `` The court is confident that members of the groups will take the view that historically technical distinctions should not be imposed to prevent the widest possible participation in the event which has as its purpose social interaction and charitable aims,'' he concluded.

<TEXT>
 A court in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s central <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province convicted 20 people for killing giant pandas and selling the rare animals' skins, a pro-Beijing newspaper reported Friday. The Chinese-language New Evening Post said the culprits were caught with the help of residents in <LOCATION> Pingwu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> in the northern part of the province, but did not elaborate. <PERSON> Pingwu </PERSON> is one of the few areas in southwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> where the giant panda, an endangered species and a national symbol, is found in the wild. The report identified only two defendants, <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tianyin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jinhua </PERSON>. It said some defendants received life terms and others received lighter sentences in the April 8 trial. The New Evening Post did not give details of how the gang operated or say how many of the animals were killed. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s panda population, just under 1,000, has been declining for the last five years because a rare flowering cycle of the arrow bamboo, the animals' main food, has caused many of the plants to die.

<HEAD>Minority Students Occupy Dean's Office at Williams College</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An estimated 30 minority students took over the dean's office at <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> today, the eve of Parents' Weekend at the prestigious liberal arts school, a spokesman for the group said. The spokesman, who declined to identify himself, said black, Hispanic, Asian and Polynesian students occupied the <ORGANIZATION> Janness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> at 8:30 a.m., when only one member of the dean's staff was in the building, and the group was not allowing anyone but minority supporters inside the building. Shortly after noon, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> of the College <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Fix </PERSON> issued a statement saying that college officials were prepared to meet with the students. `` In recent weeks, senior members of the administration have met with these students _ and have offered repeatedly to hold further meetings with them _ to discuss their concerns and to report on a variety of initiatives the college is taking to achieve the important goals we share,'' Fix said. `` All of us in the college are prepared to continue such discussions in any atmosphere that is conducive to the free and open exchange of ideas.'' However, college spokeswoman <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Berek </PERSON> said she did not know if any meetings had been arranged. The group occupying the building calls itself the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. The students have vowed to stay in the office until the college responds to their demands for increased minority hiring and other grievances presented to college President <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> in February, the spokesman said. `` After receiving inadequate response, we decided this action was necessary,'' the spokesman said. Reading from a prepared statement, he said: `` We took this action to protest the administration's unwillingness to address substantially fundamental issues relating to minority concerns at the college. `` These issues relate to recruitment, hiring goals and policies with regard to minority faculty, staff and students. They also relate to the broader issues of minority representation in the curriculum,'' the statement said. The protesters also said they were upset that the university `` reneged from its stance of disinvestment advocacy'' in companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Minority students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, more than 40 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Williamstown </LOCATION>, occupied buildings on their campuses for several days in February to protest racial discrimination at those schools. Those protests ended after the heads of the schools signed agreements with the students to increase funding of minority projects and make other concessions.

<HEAD>Presidential Election Campaign Draws To A Close</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first round of the presidential campaign ended Friday with a burst of speeches, and all indications said President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> would make it to the runoff. More than 38.3 million people are registered to vote in Sunday's election <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, 71, a Socialist seeking a second seven-year term, is expected to finish well in front. The contest is to determine who will face him in the runoff May 8. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, 55, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s conservative premier, was in second place, according to final polls. Under French law, no opinion polls can be published in the week immediately before an election. Former center-right Premier <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, 64, who led all rightist candidates for most of the past year, has stumbled badly since February but maintains he still has a chance. `` They should n't sell the bearskin until the bear has been killed,'' he said. Friday was the last day of the two-week `` official campaign.'' No further radio and television appearances are permitted and no political rallies can be held. There are nine candidates running in the first round. Although the final polls showed <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> would defeat either <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> or Barre in the runoff, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> had narrowed the gap in the latest surveys. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> both have pledged to throw their support behind the best-placed conservative in the effort to unseat <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON>. `` The important thing is to defeat socialism and its candidate, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>,'' said conservative Interior Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON>, speaking at a political meeting. `` The time has come to get rid of socialism, which has proved its incompetence.'' If, as is most likely, the runoff is between <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, the big question is how much of <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>'s vote and that of extreme right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> will switch to the premier's camp. A significant number of <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>'s supporters are Communists unhappy with their party's pro-immigrant stand. They could return to their natural leftist inclinations in the runoff. <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>'s backers include a large number of centrists who may not support <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> The biggest unknown is the still large number of undecided voters. One poll said up to 20 percent were undecided. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who scheduled his final big political rally of the campaign for Friday night at <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Le </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bourget </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, has distanced himself from the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> he founded and led for a decade. During the final years of his first administration, he has also abandoned his anti-capitalist rhetoric and moved toward the center. Recently he has been increasing harsh on <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, calling him `` ultra conservative'' and linking his views with those of <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> and others on the extreme right. The language of the campaign has been generally vague, with few specific proposals from any of the candidates. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> said he was `` stunned by the mediocrity, the inexistence of political debate.'' In one of his final television appeals, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> repeated one of his few specific proposals _ a minimum guaranteed wage which he said would be partly financed by re-imposition of a tax on large fortunes. The wealth tax was instituted by the Socialists in 1981 and repealed by the conservatives after they won the 1986 legislative elections and took control of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> stressed defense in one of his last speeches. While saying disarmament should be a priority, he emphasized that the first steps had to be made by the superpowers. `` If we did not have our nuclear deterrent, we would be the hostages of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s small atomic force. In reality, the positions of the three major candidates are strikingly similar. All stress the importance of 1992 when the single European market legally goes into effect; all speak of the need to reform the education system and promote scientific and technological research to defeat unemployment; all want to reduce taxes and ensure that the poorest Frenchmen are cared for. The differences are mainly a matter of nuance and style. The final polls showed <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> leading in the first round with about 35-37 percent, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> with 22-24 percent, <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> at 16-17 percent and <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> with 11-12 percent. Also running are <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoinie </PERSON>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> candidate; <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Juquin </PERSON>, leader of a splinter <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> reform movement; <PERSON> Arlette </PERSON> <PERSON> Laguiller </PERSON>, a Trotskyist; <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Waechter </PERSON>, an ecologist; and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Boussel </PERSON>, another Trotskyist.

<HEAD>In Catholic West Belfast, Despair Over 86 Percent Unemployment</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For 23-year-old <PERSON> Ciaran </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic whose entire life has been caught up in the violence of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, finding a job has become an impossible dream. `` All my life I've been unemployed,'' he said. `` I've tried everything now to get a job. I even tried to be a street cleaner. But there does n't seem much likelihood; there's too much prejudice.'' <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s overall jobless rate is 17 percent _ nearly double mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s. Catholics, although 40 percent of the province's 1.5 million population, suffer 2 -LCB- times more unemployment than Protestants. In mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, unemployment is about 47 percent with pockets as high as 86 percent for young men. The British government is under pressure from local community and religious leaders, the moderate <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government to tackle unemployment and urban decay in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. They argue that the area is a recruiting ground for the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> because many of its 100,000 residents have no jobs, live in poor housing and are in constant friction with the security forces. `` People only turn to paramilitary organizations in desperation, only when they are a last option,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you do give them a chance _ treat them with decency, humanity, and give them jobs _ I think you will find support for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> withering away.'' The government has unveiled draft legislation to stamp out bias by making companies monitor the religious makeup of their work forces. It also threatens criminal charges against those who make insufficient effort to recruit minority workers. But the laws will not go into effect before next year, and critics say they are not tough enough. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, fighting to end British rule and unite the province with the overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, regards factories, shops and offices as legitimate targets, attacking dozens even in their west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> stronghold. The fire-blackened shells of the Lake Glen Hotel and a number of stores in the heart of the district stand as reminders of past <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> gasoline-bomb attacks. The Rev. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> told mourners at the funeral of a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> man killed by a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremist that the nation's leaders must stop talking and do something to alleviate the `` great deprivation'' in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> `` For many young people, unemployment is their lives and that is an indictment of those who look after us, those who govern our country,'' <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. `` Unless something is done, we will be celebrating a lot more funerals.'' Northern Ireland Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s chief minister in the province, said this month that the government is working on proposals for the economic regeneration of west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> but details have not been disclosed.

It's depressing. ... I would do anything at all. You name it, I'd do it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Prisoners Freed On 100th Day Of New Presidency</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Nationalist government Friday freed about 6,000 prisoners and reduced jail terms for about 16,000 others to commemorate the 100th day after President <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>'s death. Under the mass commutation, 19 political prisoners were released from jail and sentences were cut for 11 others, according to <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials. Ministry officials said the release of the 6,054 prisoners, including gangsters, drug addicts and corrupt officials, began at dawn after brief ceremonies at jails around the island. Each prisoner was given a red package containing about $ 17 to wish them luck, they said. Television showed the prisoners, some smiling and some tearful, met by anxious wives, children and other relatives waiting in drizzly weather outside the jails. President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON> proposed the commutations in February after succeeding <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON>, who died of heart failure on January 13. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, the first native Taiwanese to head the Nationalist government, spent part of the day at rural Tahsi southwest of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> paying his respects at the late leader's masoleum. Many analysts believed <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> would be an ineffectual figurehead after the end of the authoritarian <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> family dynasty. But <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a low-key vice president under <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>, has emerged as a popular leader of growing influence who has maintained a high profile since becoming president. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was named acting <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief to replace <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> just two week's after the former president's death and is widely expected to be named party chairman at a congress in July. `` He's not as powerful as President <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> and he may never be, but he's not a figurehead ... He's done better than some people expected,'' <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ya-li </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said in a recent interview. `` He's aware there is n't any serious rival to him.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has spent much of his time pushing his predecessor's policy of introducing democratic change. <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON>'s re-evaluation of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s relationship with Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also is continuing. <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>, brought the Nationalists to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> after the Chinese Communists chased them from mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1949. His party still claims to be the rightful ruler of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Nationalist government still prohibits official contact with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but increasingly tolerates unofficial links, such as indirect trade and travel to the mainland to visit relatives. Among the released political prisoners Friday were six Taiwanese businessmen sentenced in 1984 and 1986 to 10 to 12 years in jail for visiting mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for business purposes, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Another released political prisoner was 47-year-old <PERSON> Pai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ya-chan </PERSON>, who was sentenced in 1975 to life imprisonment for distributing leaflets calling on <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>, then chairman of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, to reveal his wealth and to recall his daughter from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to show his confidence in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. After arriving at <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>'s domestic airport from a jail on <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 180 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pai </PERSON> tearfully told reporters he was grateful for those people who `` fought hard for human rights and ending political oppression.'' He said he wanted to join opposition politics. Under Friday's commutation, death sentences were reduced to life imprisonment, life sentences to 15 years and lesser sentences were cut by one-third or one-half. Many prisoners released already were serving sentences reduced when martial law was lifted in July. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shih-min </PERSON> said the commutations affected all but a few hundred prisoners sentenced for first-degree murders, ammunition smuggling and other crimes that could `` endanger national security and social stability.'' Two political prisoners did not have their sentences reduced because they were accused of being communists, officials said. Two men jailed earlier this year for advocating an independent <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> were not affected by the commutation because the verdicts are under appeal. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has called for the immediate release of all political prisoners. Noted dissident <PERSON> Shih </PERSON> <PERSON> Ming-teh </PERSON> had his life sentence commuted to 15 years ending in 1995, officials said. <PERSON> Shih </PERSON>, 47, was jailed for involvement in a bloody 1979 anti-government demonstration in the southern port of <LOCATION> Kaohsiung </LOCATION>. He has been kept in a military hospital in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> because of his frail health. After <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> died in 1975, the government released 3,500 prisoners and reduced the sentences of 13,000 others in a similar mass commutation.

 Riot police fired tear gas Friday to drive back thousands of radical students hurling rocks and firebombs and calling for the ouster of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. Protesters in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and the southern cities of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> said the government must be defeated in Tuesday's National Assembly elections. They shouted `` Down with the dictatorship!'' and `` Overthrow the ruling party!'' The government has deployed thousands of riot police across the nation to quell growing violence in campaigning for the elections. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> ordered a crackdown Thursday after dozens of people were injured in confrontations between supporters of rival candidates. The worst violence Friday was at <ORGANIZATION> Jooang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Hundreds of riot police in green combat fatigues and visored helmets marched on the campus to stop a march by students from nine colleges. Protesters hurled hundreds of rocks and firebombs that exploded in sheets of burning gasoline. Police armored vans and rifle squads fired barrages of tear gas. Students with firebombs and rocks battled police briefly in a street clash in the southern opposition stronghold of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. Police fired tear gas to break up the protest. Clashes were reported at two other <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> colleges and at <ORGANIZATION> Dongui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the port of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>. Students staged peaceful anti-government protests in <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kunsan </LOCATION>. Several injuries were reported in the clashes, but no overall figures were available. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, riot police broke up a protest by about 120 journalists urging the government to issue a permit for a new newspaper. Two hundred police moved in when journalists from the projected <ORGANIZATION> Hankyoreh </ORGANIZATION> newspaper occupied stairs of the <ORGANIZATION> Sejong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to stage a sit-in. There were no injuries reported. Earlier Friday, radicals firebombed an office of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, police said. Nobody was reported injured. The party's office in the northern city of <LOCATION> Chechon </LOCATION> was damaged overnight in a bomb attack, police said. An office of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was set on fire in an attack in the southern city of <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, police said. Large amounts of campaign literature were destroyed, but there were no injuries. Opposition leaders repeated charges that the government would rig the elections. They threatened to call for massive protests if the elections are not fair. Opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> told a news conference that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was concealing widespread official corruption. He issued a list of 53 governing party assembly candidates he alleged were `` anti-national'' and guilty of corruption. The opposition has been attempting to discredit <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> with recent revelations of alleged fraud in the administration of his predecessor, former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. The rival opposition parties, hobbled by divisions and public anger over their internal power struggles, hope to deny the government a majority in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was elected in December when the opposition split.

 Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said there has been a serious proposal that he celebrate a Christmas Mass in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that would be televised throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> prelate mentioned the proposal Thursday at a news conference called to discuss his meeting with Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. But he declined to reveal any details about the proposal, including who made it. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was talking about his hope that the church might be given access to government-controlled airwaves in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Then he added: `` I might just use as a parallel that there has been a serious proposal to me that on Christmas Day I offer Mass in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with the promise that the Mass would be televised throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' `` It would seem to me that if that could happen, the potential for the church to communicate very freely here would be turned into a real possibility,'' he said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Zwilling </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> archdiocese </LOCATION>, said Friday he did not know about the proposal. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> indicated that hundreds of political prisoners could be freed from <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> jails if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave them visas. The cardinal, who held three hours of talks with the Cuban leader before dawn Thursday, said <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> welcomed the possibility of having a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> act as a liaison between the prisoners and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities in order to speed up the visa process. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> told him there were 453 political prisoners in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` I think he indicated ... that a very, very large proportion of those could be released from prison quite quickly if visas were granted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and that it is important that if they are released, they leave the country immediately,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. The Roman Catholic cardinal said the president also agreed to a request for more visas for foreign nuns, but did not give a specific figure. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said the two also discussed the possibility of U.S.-Cuban cooperation in health care, particularly the fight against AIDS. The cardinal said he stressed to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> that the church transcends politics. `` I told the president frankly that I think he had a tremendous opportunity to use the church in the right sense of the term. I told him it certainly should not be exploited,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. In response, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> praised the American church for its work and spoke glowingly of the pope. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was asked whether <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> might allow the church access to the government-controlled airwaves. `` I would hope that that would be one of the things that would happen in the not too distant future,'' he said. Earlier, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> told reporters, `` I feel that the mission was accomplished and that the president recognized clearly my primary purpose in coming here.'' He described that goal as showing the solidarity of the church throughout the world and its dedication to peace. A meeting with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> had been expected. Reporters were hustled from the Wednesday night Mass celebrated by the cardinal and taken to the presidential palace, where they were told <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> had agreed to a photo session with the visiting prelate. At 11:30 p.m., a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> had canceled the photo session because <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> arrived late.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes blasted <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla bases in hills overlooking the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today in their sixth attack on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year, police reported. They said eight fighter-bombers took part in the 10-minute air attack, bombing and rocketing a string of guerrilla positions belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. The group is based in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and also is backed by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. It is headed by <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, a former Syrian army captain. The group had claimed responsibility for an attack on a north Israeli Army base by a guerrilla flying a motorized hand glider in November. Six Israeli soldiers were killed and eight others wounded in that attack. Confirming today's air raid, the army command in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said its planes bombed and destroyed <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> guerrilla command posts and ammunition depots north of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s port of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, provincial capital of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It said in a brief communique that the raiding jets returned safely to base after scoring accurate hits on their targets. The police said the stricken targets stretch along a three-mile strip from the coastal town of <LOCATION> Damour </LOCATION> to the outskirts of <LOCATION> Barja </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Kharroub </LOCATION> region, about 15 miles south of the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> capital, police said. They said guerrillas fired anti-aircraft guns and Soviet-made SAM-7 Strella missiles on the raiding jets. The Israeli planes released hot air balloons to defelect the heat-seeking projectiles. Police said <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> was closed to traffic during the attack. They said they had no immediate report of casualties. At least 48 people have been killed and 63 wounded in the five previous Israeli raids since Jan. 3. The last attack targeted guerrilla bases in hills southeast of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> on March 24. Nine people were killed and five wounded in that attack.

<HEAD>IRS Revokes PTL's Tax Exempt Status
^Eds: Combines urgent series</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> announced today it has revoked the tax-exempt status of the troubled PTL ministry. The announcement follows a court ruling earlier this week dissolving a preliminary injunction that had prevented the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> from taking such action. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Witmer </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> regional office in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said the action was taken because `` we felt the organization has not operated within the guidelines ... in its original charter.'' He said court papers filed in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy proceedings indicated that individuals in the organization had profited substantially from donations made to the ministry and that <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> had `` excessive unrelated business income or income which was not really in keeping with the tax-exempt purpose.'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said ministry officials were not immediately available for comment. An <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> statement said the agency `` can no longer assure taxpayers of the deductibility of contributions to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>,'' effective immediately. Past contributions are fully deductible, however, it said. And if <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> appeals the action to federal court, contributions by individuals would still be deductible up to $ 1,000 until the appeal is decided, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said. `` In any event, however, contributions to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> are not deductible by any individual who was, in whole or part, responsible for the activities on the part of the organization that were the basis for the revocation,'' the statement said. `` Generally, this would not include the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> partners and contributors.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said it would re-evaluate the situation if <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> is re-established or forms a new, exclusively charitable organization. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s troubles began in March 1987 when its founder, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, resigned amid allegations of sexual improprieties. The ministry, based in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, filed for reorganization in federal bankruptcy court in June 1987. On Wednesday, the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, affirmed a federal judge's ruling that the bankruptcy court did not have the authority to issue a preliminary injunction preventing the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> from revoking the ministry's tax-exempt status. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> trustee <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said then that the ministry was considering additional appeals.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today that Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should not resign and has not offered to, despite a face-to-face meeting in which two departing <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials told the president that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s behavior is hurting his department. The president, walking to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after a nearby meeting on an unrelated subject, was asked about the troubles of his attorney general. `` Should <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> resign?'' a reporter asked. `` No,'' said the president. `` Has he offered to?'' `` No.'' The president was then asked if the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was running well. `` Just fine,'' he replied. Earlier, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, told an interviewer: `` We do n't know what will happen next. All we know is that the attorney general is functioning and functioning well and that the president expressed his continuing confidence.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was referring to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> Wednesday, which sources said came minutes after one of the two aides told the president that an aggressive prosecutor would seek <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s indictment One of those aides, Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said today he and former criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> had `` a marvelous conversation'' with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said the president `` was very candid.'' `` It was a very, very frank exchange of ideas that we had with him and he's got to make his decision in his way in his own time and I'm confident that he will do it,'' said <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. Burns, meeting with reporters on his last day on the job, said, `` I have to confess to you that it is indeed a very sad day.'' During the 45-minute discussion called by the president, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and White House counsel A.B. <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> that `` <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s behavior was hurting the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>,'' an administration source said. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, meanwhile, `` laid out the facts'' in a hypothetical indictment he said he would have brought against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> if he were the special prosecutor investigating the attorney general, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had violated the standards of ethical conduct for executive branch employees spelled out in a 1965 executive order and that if other <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorneys had acted as <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has, `` they would be bounced -LRB- fired -RRB-,'' the source added. The ethical standards, among other things, say that employees should avoid any action which could create the appearance of using public office for private gain, giving preferential treatment to any organization or person or making a government decision outside official channels. `` The president was very attentive, listened to the story, got up and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> came in'' after <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> left, said the source. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> today quoted a source, who also requested anonymity, as saying <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> commented that he would not make any decision about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s future until independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> finishes his report on the attorney general. Since last May 11, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has been the subject of a criminal investigation by <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who has been examining <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s assistance to scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a proposed $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project at the behest of longtime friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. Also under investigation are <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s meetings with regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone company executives at a time when he owned $ 14,000 in <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> stock and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s role in securing a $ 40,000-a-year job for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife. In an interview published in today's <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> and conducted before word of his meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> became public, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said the president continues to express his `` total support ... and total confidence.'' The attorney general told the newspaper he meets the highest ethical standards expected of public officials and knows of no factor `` right now that would cause me to resign.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> today, spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said he would have no immediate comment. A department source close to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the meeting between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> lasted longer than the one involving <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and that the president had expressed full support for the attorney general. In the meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> told the president that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who is under indictment in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, had taken advantage of his relationship with the attorney general to promote his own business interests, said the administration source. Burns, while not using these specific words, in effect told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that `` <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was selling the office of the attorney general,'' the source added. During the White House meeting, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that if he were the special prosecutor in the criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, he would seek an indictment of the attorney general, said the source. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> had made similar comments to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on March 29 when <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> announced to the attorney general that they were quitting out of concern that the nearly yearlong probe of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has damaged the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s operations, morale and image. According to the source, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> in his meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` laid out the facts'' in a hypothetical indictment. In the past, said several administration sources, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> has told <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> associates that he feels a number of felony charges could be lodged against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> based on the evidence known to date. These would include conspiracy counts and involve the acceptance of illegal gratuities, a violation of Ethics in Government Act provisions spelling out conflicts of interest and a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act barring bribes to foreign officials, the sources said. According to the sources, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>'s legal analysis in part revolves around: _ A September 1985 memo to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Wallach </LOCATION> in connection with the Iraqi pipeline mentions planned payments to the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of then-Prime Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> says he does n't recall reading the portion of the memo regarding planned payments _ A $ 150,000 legal fee paid by one of the partners in the oil pipeline to <LOCATION> Wallach </LOCATION> which ended up in a stock trading account owned by <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s financial manager <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> in effect pooled <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s money with that of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and a few other investors, enabling him to buy large amounts of brand-new stock issues and sell them on the same day, usually at a substantial profit. Three months before the fee went to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had referred his longtime friend to then-National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who directed subordinates to try to facilitate an insurance package to enable the pipeline to be built. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> turned a $ 40,000 profit for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on a $ 50,000 investment in just 23 stock trades over 18 months. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> says that under the partnership with <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, all financial details were kept secret from him.

<HEAD>Senate Democrats Lose Another Attempt on Campaign Spending Limits
Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats put their congressional campaign spending limits proposal on the shelf Friday after losing another attempt to overcome <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opposition and force a vote on the issue. Fifty-three senators, including four Republicans, voted to invoke cloture, or end debate, but this was seven votes short of what is needed to suspend the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s unlimited debate rule. This was the tenth time since last June that Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, lost a cloture on the divisive The first eight attempts came over a bill that would have established a voluntary system of limits for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaigns. The latest losses on Thursday and Friday prevented a vote on a proposal by Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, to amend the Constitution to overcome a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that mandatory limits violate free speech rights. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said after Friday's attempt that six of the 10 absent senators would have voted for cloture, leaving him `` within striking distance'' of the needed 60 votes. He said that while he was pulling the issue from the floor, members should n't assume that he would not bring it back in the future. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said Republicans do n't oppose placing limits on campaign spending but as a group do n't want to tamper with the Constitution or vote for any legislation that would `` I'm willing to try to work out some bipartisan measure that is fair across-the-board and does n't discriminate against anybody,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` We are spending too much money.'' He and Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky., said that even if <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> succeeded in winning cloture for the proposed constitutional amendment, it was unlikely the measure could get the 67 votes needed to pass the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>

<TEXT>
 Sixth graders who fed an experimental rat a steady diet of junk food and watched him deteriorate into red-eyed lethargy say they're convinced: The road to good living is n't paved with tasty treats. But there was one problem with the experiment. The junk food rat, Honey, outlived his companion, Nut, who was fed only health food. Nut died while choking on a cracker as the results were announced Thursday. `` He was extremely healthy,'' a distraught <PERSON> Kathie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dilks </PERSON> assured her class at <ORGANIZATION> Harrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The teacher announced that they would provide Nut with a proper burial. The experiment had been slated to last another 3 -LCB- weeks, but, even with Nut's death, the results have already convinced students like <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Amiss </PERSON>, 12, to heed the good nutritional points his mom has been making for years. `` She likes me to eat healthy stuff so I can grow healthy. If you eat too much junk food, you wo n't grow up,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said, adding that all the hoopla probably wo n't stop him from enjoying a candy bar once in awhile. `` I usually eat them for dessert,'' he whispered out of the earshot of the adults who were busy explaining the results of the first 10 days of the five-week experiment. The test showed that a steady diet of junk food caused a baby white rat to grow at a slower rate than a companion rat who was fed the school-lunch menu, Ms. <PERSON> Dilks </PERSON> said. Honey, who dined on Oreo cookies, red licorice and orange marshmallows, appeared lethargic and sleepy during a news conference at the southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> school. An open can of stale soda waited nearby in case Honey grew thirsty. `` Rats can not burp. When you feed them soda, you have to make sure it's flat,'' said <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, a registered dietitian with the Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ribbon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the food-service company that sponsored the experiment. Honey frisked and twitched around his glass cage when not dozing. `` It's probably a sugar high,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dilks </PERSON> said. Honey, who weighed in at 45.5 grams, also looked a tad dingy. `` He's a little yellow. He's not getting enough nutrients,' said 12-year-old <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Plum </PERSON> as he escorted the red-eyed rodent around the classroom. Nut, the rat who munched on tossed salads, bananas and pizza, weighed in at a whopping 78 grams prior to his sudden death and showed substantial tail growth. `` We want to apply this to our own eating habits,'' Ms. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> told 16 nodding heads who offered examples of how the test changed their lives. Orange juice and cheese appears to be the new after-school snack for the majority of the class, except 11-year-old <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Irizarry </PERSON>. `` Nah, my mom does n't let me eat junk food anyway,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said she would obtain two more rats to complete the experiment before school ends in June.

<HEAD>Three Policemen Die In Separatist Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Melanesian separatists stormed a police station Friday and fled with 26 police hostages after a battle that left three <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officers dead and about 20 people wounded. More than 20 kidnappers attacked with guns and knives on the small island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, about 90 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>, capital of this French <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> territory. They demanded that 300 police reinforcements be withdrawn and that <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> send an emissary to discuss independence. Officials said Friday night that negotiations had not begun and that police had not been in contact with the attackers, who fled into the bush with their captives. A massive search was under way. The attack came two days before a territorial election on a new autonomy plan for the archipelago, coinciding with the French presidential elections. Native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up 43 percent of the territory's 145,000 people. The rest are European settlers, Polynesians and Asians. Many Melanesians seek independence, and most European settlers want to remain French. Trouble first broke out in November 1984 and has erupted sporadically since then, leaving 31 people dead. In other incidents Thursday and Friday, the city hall of Paita was set on fire and power lines were blown up near <LOCATION> Canala </LOCATION>. Two grenades were thrown at a separatist radio station in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION> and a shot was fired at a police vehicle. No injuries were reported in the incidents. The attack on <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, a 100-square-mile atoll with a population of about 2,800, was carried out about 7 a.m. by 20 to 30 men in the village of <LOCATION> Fayaoue </LOCATION>. Families of the policemen who lived at the station were not attacked and suffered no injuries, officials said. The station itself was sacked and a large amount of unspecified equipment stolen. Among the wounded were three policeman, one in critical condition with a bullet wound in the back of the head, and three of the attackers, one listed in serious condition, police said. The seriously injured were evacuated to <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the government of Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> vowed to re-establish order as quickly as possible. `` Instructions have been given to dispatch the necessary reinforcements to the island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>, minister for overseas territories, after an urgent meeting between <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> and ministers directly concerned. `` The government can not accept attacks on policemen, that they kill them and take them hostage,'' <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said. `` It will not allow things to get worse.'' <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON>, security minister of the self-proclaimed `` government of Kanaky,'' said in a telephone interview that he had been in contact with a leader of the attackers. `` The gendarmes held by the people in <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> are in good health,'' <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON> said. `` There are no wounded among them. They are all well treated.'' He said the attackers refused to negotiate while police reinforcements remained on the island. <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON>, leader of <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the main separatist organization, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone he did not know of the attack in advance. <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON> called the incident `` frightful,'' but said it was not surprising in that `` demands for independence are absolutely not taken into consideration, that people are scorned and the government refuses to listen to them.'' Tjibaou's organization, which is boycotting the elections, also boycotted last year's referendum on independence, saying only Melanesians should be allowed to vote. The territory voted overwhelmingly for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> charged today that the Democratic leadership of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` has caved in to organized labor'' on key issues of the trade bill that he has threatened to veto. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a group of conservative legislators, that the plant-closing provision in the bill would cost American jobs by hurting industry. The provision would require industries to give 60 days notice to employees of plant closings. `` I'd like to be able to sign trade legislation this year,'' the president said. `` I've worked in good faith with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to produce an acceptable bill.'' `` Put simply, on key provisions in the tradd bill, the Democratic leadership in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has caved in to pressure from organized labor,'' he said. `` The plant-closing restriction in the bill would make American industry less competitive. Not the way to go if you want to redress the trade imabalance and save jobs. In fact, the restriction would cost jobs.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> quoted an unnamed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist as saying of his veto threat, `` I think he's crying wolf.'' `` Try me,'' the president told the group. `` If this bill is unloaded on my desk, I'll stamp it ` reject' and ship it back to where it was made.'' Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said he was not sure the bill would pass the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by the two-thirds majority needed to override a threatened presidential veto. But <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, when deciding whether to veto it, should not presume the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could quickly strip out provisions opposed by the White House and pass another version. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s comments came as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> began debate on the bill, the result of a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> compromise between competing versions. The measure rolled through the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday by an overwhelming 312-107 vote. `` The administration ought to pay close attention to the whopping majority of that vote,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote will give added momentum'' to its supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said he could `` only hope'' that if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed the bill, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could find the two-thirds majority needed to override. The president's lobbyists were working hard against it, he said. If the president's veto were sustained and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> forced to bring forward a new bill, it would have to re-run the `` obstacle course'' the current compromise has already cleared, he said. The president should assume `` this is it _ it wo n't get another chance,'' said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. Va.. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, defended the measure as providing the trade policy the `` We have n't had a trade policy ... since World War II,'' and did without one while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was the world's dominant economic power, he said. `` But that time has changed, and now we're in tough competition. Before debate began, opponents of the bill asked for assurances of adequate debate time. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said the vote would not occur before Tuesday evening. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> again warned that an administration favorite _ the pending free-trade agreement to phase out tariffs between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ could get entangled in any <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Thursday that he will veto the bill if it arrives on his desk with a provision to require all but the smallest employers to give 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. Business groups have fought the plant-closings provision on grounds it would dry up capital for investment, frighten off customers and cause economic stagnation. Unions are calling for the measure, saying that notifying employees about to lose their jobs is the only humane thing to do. In recent days the dispute over plant closings has overshadowed the centerpiece features of the bill, which would streamline the system under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> aids companies threatened by imports and retaliates against international trade violations. Scores of other provisions range from repeal of the windfall oil profits tax to sizeable agricultural subsidies. A key vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> came just before the roll call on final passage, when lawmakers voted 253-167 against a move by Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., to send the measure back to conference committee with orders to drop the plant-closings provision On the final vote on the bill itself, the hefty <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> margin reflected concern in Northeastern states over import competition and perhaps election-year reluctance to fight anything billed as sharpening the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> edge in global markets. On the roll call, 244 Democrats backed the bill and two opposed it. Reps. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, D-Mo., said it should go further and include something similar to his amendment to roll back Japanese trade surpluses Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the bill contained too much protectionism. Sixty-eight Republicans voted for the bill and 105 opposed it. There were heavy defections among <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Republicans. The lawmakers spent most of the afternoon leading up to the vote arguing over the plant-closings provision. `` This amendment is obviously a non-germane, counterproductive hitchhiker that's going to get this bill vetoed,'' Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., said `` We can exorcize this demon.'' Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., called the bill too important to get hung up on an issue such as plant-closing notifications He said it ought to be viewed as a relatively minor amendment because `` it is so modest, it has been so watered down and it contains so many exceptions'' that it probably would not do as much as its supporters hoped. `` I want to talk about plant openings not plant closings,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. But House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, called on lawmakers to imagine how their families would be affected if they suddenly lost their jobs. He called for approval of the bill with the plant-closings provision intact.

 Actress <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON>, in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, has complained about its coverage of her appearance at the Academy Awards.

 An infant taken from a hospital four hours after his birth has been found, and a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> couple have been arrested in the case. A policeman involved in the recovery happened to be the infant's godfather and namesake <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 25, and <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 32, both of <LOCATION> Crowell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, were arrested in <LOCATION> Holbrook </LOCATION> after the infant was found early Thursday in the back seat of a car, said police Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. The infant was taken Wednesday from <ORGANIZATION> Yavapai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Prescott </LOCATION>, apparently by a woman masquerading as a hospital laboratory worker. Police said the woman told the mother she was taking the baby for tests. Mrs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said in a court appearance in <LOCATION> Holbrook </LOCATION> that she was forced into participating in the abduction because her husband wanted a baby.

<HEAD>Chambers County Rancher Says Lion Hunts Legal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COVE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chance to hunt a lion is the lure of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON>'s ranch, but it's making some of the neighbors nervous. `` I've gotten some phone calls from a few people who have heard rumors about lion hunts and are worried about them,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a Cove councilman. `` Their main fear, of course, is what if the lion gets loose and starts roaming.'' <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON> says his lions are no more dangerous than the wild boars already living in the boggy area of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` My lions have been raised in captivity,'' said <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON>, who offers 20 species including deer, sheep and antelope for hunting at his three ranches. He buys his lions from people who bought them when they were `` cute, cuddly cubs.'' `` The ones I get are usually past their prime,'' said <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON>. `` They're old and mean and not useful any more. The zoos usually ca n't use them and they were destined for the gas chamber when I get them.'' Some residents do n't like the idea of having lions in the area. `` I'm very nervous about anybody turning loose a lion in the marsh,'' said Chambers County Clerk <PERSON> Beanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>. `` Now I'll be worrying whenever I hear my dog bark or my grandchildren go to play in the back yard.'' The hunts are conducted on a 400-acre area in the marsh called <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, which is surrounded by bayous, canals and waterways, <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON> said. State officials says it is legal to hold a lion hunt on private property, but not on the adjoining federal land. <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON> said he has booked six lion hunts in the last year. `` Those who do it usually have a lot of money to play with,'' said <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON>, who charges $ 2,500 to $ 3,500.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriarty </PERSON>, who once flew a single-engine plane through the opening at the base of the Eiffel Tower, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison on a drug-conspiracy charge. Chief Circuit Judge <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> also ordered a $ 250,000 fine and 15 years probation. `` I'm very upset ...

He criticized <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON>'s decision not to dismiss the verdict of the jury that found him guilty in February of conspiring to traffic in cocaine but innocent of a cocaine-trafficking charge. `` I'm going up to the ` <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>' with the biggest sentence anybody has gotten in this case,'' said the 41-year-old pilot from Coconut Grove, who has been held in the <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail since his arrest in October 1986. `` I just got sentenced to 15 years in prison for something I did n't do.''

<HEAD>Brazilian Fly Released to Control Spreading Crop Pest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A red-eyed Brazilian fly was turned loose Friday in an experimental effort to control the mole cricket, which chews up $ 47 million worth of crops and lawns each year. The first release of 250 fly pupae in an <LOCATION> Alachua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> pasture will probably be followed by others throughout the summer, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, director of the project at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're optimistic, but the whole thing is a big experiment,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. The mole cricket, which probably arrived by ship from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, damages vegetation by tunneling through it. The pest is now spreading into <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said The Brazilian fly, about the size of a house fly, comes to the mating call of male mole crickets, and lays her living larvae on or near the singer. The larvae then burrow into the male and his mates. Ten days later the mole cricket is dead, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> IFAS </ORGANIZATION> entomologist who will monitor the progress of the Brazilian fly. `` We should know in a year if the larvae are surviving,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. `` And in two years we'll have a reasonable idea of whether it's a success.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> granted permission to release the flies after laboratory tests demonstrated they only attack mole crickets. The fly is the third biocontrol agent that <ORGANIZATION> IFAS </ORGANIZATION> has unleashed in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> against mole crickets. A wasp that subdues mole crickets but does not sting people was the first. Turned loose in 1981 near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, the colony is holding its own there. They mainly attack a tropical mole cricket that is only a pest in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, however. Nematodes, microscopic worms, were released in 1985 and 1986 in several <LOCATION> Alachua </LOCATION> pastures. Offspring are still there and seem to have caused a decline in mole cricket populations at the release sites, but <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> says the nematodes are harder to handle than the Brazilian fly.

<HEAD>Iraq's Recapture Of Faw Gives Iraq Big Political Lift</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s recapture of the <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> peninsula from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> this week provided <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> with a major political victory, despite the limited military value of the dusty uninhabited wasteland. The successful attack on the peninsula, extending from southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, robbed <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> of a key bargaining chip that could be used if the countries ever negotiate for peace. `` It's insignificant as far as the military situation is concerned,'' a Baghdad-based Western diplomat said of the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> victory. `` But psychologically, it had been the needle in their flesh.'' The Iraqis are, not unnaturally, hailing their recovery of <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> as one of their greatest military triumphs in the 7 -LCB- - year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war While analysts doubt that, they concede it has given <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> a big morale boost. The elite <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> smashed through Iranian lines north of <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> on Sunday. By Monday afternoon they had seized full control of the peninsula that dominates <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s two main outlets to the gulf, the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Arab </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> waterways <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> captured about 12 miles of the peninsula in February 1986, stunning <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which failed in repeated bloody counterattacks to retake the flatlands. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> renamed Faw city, an abandoned refinery town, <PERSON> Al-Zahra </PERSON> and held a wrestling tournament there last year to emphasize its grip. Although <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> still occupies other small chunks of Iraqi territory along the 730-mile border, <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> was its prize. The loss of <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> `` turned <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> into a landlocked country ... and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> likes to think of itself as a gulf country,'' said a Western analyst in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. The war began in September 1980 partly because of a long-standing dispute between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> over who controls the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Arab </PERSON>, the gulf outlet of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> gave the the Iranians dominance on both sides of the waterway. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was thinking of Faw when it insisted on full application of a measure from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that demanded that the two countries withdraw to pre-war international boundaries as part of a cease-fire, the analyst said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also had Faw largely in mind when it balked at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> measure. `` It was the most important card the Iranians held'' in the scuffle for position over a possible peace settlement, the analyst said. The <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> battle also broke <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s strategy of static defense, whereby Iraqi troops would sit behind formidable protection and wait for Iranian attacks. The Iraqis, who invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1980, had stuck to that strategy since they were driven back across the border in 1981 so much so that many analysts had doubted they were capable of mounting an offensive. The Iranians may have thought the same and let their guard drop. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only significant assault into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in recent years was in May 1986, when its troops captured the deserted and weakly held border town of <LOCATION> Mehran </LOCATION> on the central front in retaliation for the loss of Faw. But victory turned quickly to debacle when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> regained the town a month later, capturing much of the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> force that had failed to seize the high ground around it. Reporters who toured the <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> battleground immediately after its recapture found few signs of the fierce hand-to-hand combat that normally characterize Iranian fighting. There were few bodies lying around and only a handful of damaged tanks and artillery pieces to be seen. Iraqi officers told reporters that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had about three divisions on the peninsula, between 10,000 and 25,000 men, far less than the 50,000 previously thought to be based there. <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION>'s chief strategic value was that it bottled up <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s small navy by lining artillery along <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only remaining outlet to the gulf, the <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>. The Shatt <PERSON> Al-Arab </PERSON> to the east had been closed since the early days of the war. But even that had only a limited value since the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has played little part in the war since its early phases. <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> also gave <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> a platform closer to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> from which it could launch missile attacks. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> of aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The diplomat, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> apparently captured an Iraqi missile battery on Faw which it used to fire Chinese-made Silkworm missiles at <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, whose capital is 50 miles southwest of the peninsula. But <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> showed Tuesday that it could hit <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> from Iranian soil when it fired a Soviet-designed Scud missile into uninhabited desert near an oilfield.

<HEAD>Strong Warning From Slovenian Leader On Threat to Socialism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economic crisis is threatening its socialist system and needs an infusion of new ideas, a high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday. `` The depth of the unvanquished crisis in many places brings in question the issue of socialism as a whole,'' said <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON>, the leader of the Slovenian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Changes, radical ones, are more than necessary.'' <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> made the comments during a speech to 421 delegates to the provincial party conference, which opened Friday. He called on the party to allow open debate `` without restoration of the classical, bourgeois parliamentary political parties'' of Western democracy. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is a single-party Communist state. An increasing number of critics, including authors, philosophers and sociologists from <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, have been pressing for introduction of a multi-party system in the country as a way out of its current economic and social crisis. Communists in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, the country's most prosperous republic, have been the most outspoken in offering unorthodox solutions to the country's problems, including introduction of a more market-oriented economy and closer ties with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has a $ 20 billion foreign debt. Unemployment is at 15 percent. Living standards are declining and inflation is at 170 percent. <PERSON> Joze </PERSON> <PERSON> Knez </PERSON>, vice-chairman of Slovenian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, on Wednesday called on the federal government to resign because of its failure to cope with the crisis. The current <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> constitution, adopted in 1974 during the rule of the late communist leader <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, created a sistem of eight virtually independent communist parties, one within each of the country's six constituent republics and two provinces. The Central Committee of the party excercises nominal control over its regional branches, but is in fact often reduced to serving as a forum where regional differences are aired.

<TEXT>
 A seashell collector found a bundle of 800 papers about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear submarine fleet at a naval base in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported today. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the papers apparently found near the Holy Loch base contained no classified information. The Scotsman, based in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, said the papers contained details of the running costs and the maintenance of the 10 <ORGANIZATION> Lafayette </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> class submarines operating out of Holy Loch, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> submarine base outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The 10 submarines are armed with <PERSON> Poseidon </PERSON> and Trident nuclear missiles. A woman collecting shells at <LOCATION> Helensburgh </LOCATION>, seven miles from the high security base, picked up a black plastic bag that contained the bundle of papers, the newspaper said. The newspaper said the papers contained financial details on the refitting of three submarines at the base, the amount given for servicing and engineering at Holy Loch and items needed for the submarines and for the submarine support vessel USS <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>. In a statement issued in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the bag was `` routine refuse that fell ashore by accident and contains only routine maintenance and logistics documents.'' `` It is easy to understand, given the incomplete and cryptic nature of the data in the refuse, how it could have been misinterpreted,'' it said. Holy Loch is the principal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> submarine base in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and is of key strategic importance to the Western <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense alliance. The base is wholly operated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, which employs more than 1,700 personnel there.

<TEXT>
 An effort by two bookstores to get a list of books used at <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> is turning into a legal battle that could force the private school to open most of its records and files to public scrutiny. State Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has asked the attorney general to issue an opinion on whether the Baptist university in <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION> is a governmental body subject to the Texas Open Records Act. He notes that the university receives $ 3.6 million in state aid in the form of tuition grants. If <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> is declared a governmental body because it accepts state funds, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> then asks whether the textbook list should be made available to the public under the state Open Records Act. So far, <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> officials have refused to give the textbook list to Bear Bookstore and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bookstore </ORGANIZATION>, two private stores off-campus. Although <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s legal inquiry is narrowly focused on the textbook issue, it could affect all <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> colleges affiliated with religious denominations, said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a group of 39 private schools. <PERSON> Abner </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> president emeritus, said: `` If he can get that -LRB- textbook list -RRB-, he can get most of the records out here.'' Under current interpretations of the Open Records Act, private schools such as <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> are not obligated to make records and files available to the public. `` The state should n't be able to look at all the records of any private organization,'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said. In a legal brief filed with Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> argued that <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> is n't a governmental body because it is `` not supported in whole or in part by public funds.''

 A prosecutor says he foresees no major hurdles in holding a third trial for a man twice sentenced to death in the kidnap, rape and killing of his niece more than 10 years ago. The death sentence of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 41, was thrown out Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> was convicted of capital murder in 1977 and again in 1979 for the death of 10-year-old <PERSON> Ramona </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Abner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jacinto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Former assistant <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION> <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>, who prosecuted <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> at both trials, was angry about the reversal. `` The responsibility for this reversal rests squarely on the shoulders of <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamail </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Jacinto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for the way they mishandled the confession,'' he said. <PERSON> Jamail </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> Jacinto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police chief and now mayor of the town in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> area, denied forcibly obtaining <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>'s confession to the March 24, 1977, slaying and said <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> `` better be able to back up those statements. <PERSON> Jamail </PERSON> called the conviction reversal a `` miscarriage of justice.'' `` This has been painful on Mrs. <PERSON> Abner </PERSON>. Her daughter would be 18 had it not been for <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>,'' he said. `` There's enough evidence to support the death penalty again.'' In its 8-1 decision, the appeals court said the second trial judge improperly allowed into evidence letters written by <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> to his wife, <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON>, after he was in custody. The letters, in which <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> admitted killing his niece, wound up in the hands of his mother-in-law, who sent them to another daughter who forwarded them to investigators. The court ruled that the letters were confidential communication between husband and wife and that their introduction as evidence violated a provision of the law that one spouse can not give adverse testimony against another. Prosecutors will ask for a rehearing, <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said, because of changes in the so-called `` spousal-immunity statute,'' which now permits such adverse testimony. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said he expects no problems in trying the case again because most of the state's witnesses are current or former law enforcement officers. According to trial testimony, <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> took <PERSON> Ramona </PERSON>, a third-grader, from school on the day of the killing, telling a teacher's aide there was a family emergency. The next day, he led police to the girl's body. A 10-inch butcher knife was found where he said he had thrown it. <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> made oral and written confessions to the crime but later alleged he had been slapped, hit and shocked with a cattle prod by <LOCATION> Jacinto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police. A <LOCATION> Jacinto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police dispatcher testified that she typed <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>'s confession and that <PERSON> Jamail </PERSON> told <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> everything to say. She also said she saw an officer hit <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Jacinto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> fired <PERSON> Jamail </PERSON> and a federal grand jury later indicted him and two other officers on charges they abused two prisoners questioned in the <PERSON> Abner </PERSON> case. All three were acquitted in 1979.

 The family of an American engineer killed by Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last year boarded a plane Friday to be in that Central American nation on the anniversary of his death. The family of <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Linder </PERSON> took along a check for $ 250,000 in donations for a project he was working on when he was fatally shot April 28, 1987. `` <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is our connection to <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> right now,'' said his brother, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Linder </PERSON>, just before the family from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, boarded a <ORGANIZATION> Lacsa </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Traveling with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Linder </PERSON> were his parents, <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Linder </PERSON>, and his sister <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON>. The family will attend activities commemorating <PERSON> Linder </PERSON>'s death while he worked on a rural electrification project, and are taking with them the fruits of a yearlong fund-raising campaign. Family members visited 220 cities across the country to collect the money, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Linder </PERSON> said. `` His death brought the war home to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> in a very personal way,'' said the brother. `` Many people told us they had simply never heard our side of the story before.'' The family filed a $ 50 million wrongful death suit Wednesday against <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> leaders headquartered here, charging that <PERSON> Linder </PERSON>, 27, was shot point-blank in the head by anti-Sandinista guerrillas after he was wounded in a gun battle. The Contras have acknowledged <PERSON> Linder </PERSON>'s death but have said only that it occurred in the middle of a battle. The <PERSON> Linders </PERSON> have said one reason for their suit and the national campaign is to end <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing of the Contra rebels fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government. The suit `` will help bring to light who the real people responsible for his death are,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Linder </PERSON>. `` It was part of a policy, a policy that begins right here in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

 Republican National Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> called for party unity, but discord was obvious as the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> state GOP convention convened Friday. Rural-county delegates expressed dismay at what one termed `` Gestapo tactics'' by <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> organizer, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wark </PERSON>, who helped engineer a <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> takeover of the state party leadership. But <PERSON> Wark </PERSON> said the gripes were unwarranted, and he said he had been `` begging people to stay involved'' rather than telling them they were being replaced by <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters. <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> told the convention that Republicans who think a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidency is certain this election year `` are dead wrong.'' He said Democrats are in a do-or-die campaign and will use smear tactics to assure a victory. He accused <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of duplicity in his statements on issues including taxation, defense spending and law-and-order legislation. The Republican chief also said it's incomprehensible to him that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, `` the most radical candidate for the presidency ever,'' could be running a close second behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said, `` The old and the new faces in our party must unite and work to defeat our common enemy,'' which he described as liberals who dominate the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said after his speech he was n't embarrassed that a Robertson-dominated delegation would come from <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> to the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> this summer, despite the fact that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> apparently will be the presidential nominee. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> echoed <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON>'s remarks about uniting to defeat Democrats, winning applause from most of the state convention delegates with the obvious exception of a crowd of rural delegates. He called for a return to quality education based on moral teachings and an end to progressive education `` that is getting progressively worse.'' And <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> also spoke against `` drug dealers, organized crime and radical homosexual activists'' and said he was opposed to legalized abortion or any efforts to block help to the nation's elderly Many of the delegates began singing `` God Bless <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' as <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> wrapped up his 25-minute speech and left the room. Delegate <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, a member of the state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> executive committee and a former state party chairman, accused <PERSON> Wark </PERSON> of `` Gestapo tactics'' in changing party rules and cutting off rural delegates from participation. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said an executive committee session late Thursday turned into a shouting match after <PERSON> Wark </PERSON> told `` Old Guard'' Republicans they were out of power. This weekend, the Republicans will finish picking a 20-member delegation to the national GOP convention. At least 16 of those national convention delegates will be <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> delegates.

 A deposed and exiled Honduran military chief charged with overseeing death squads is under house arrest after he returned from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a born-again <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who cooperated in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy against leftist <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, headed Hondura's armed forces from 1982 until he was disarmed, handcuffed and put on a plane out of the country by mutinous subordinates March 31, 1984. The former general returned April 9 from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where he has lived for the past four years. On Tuesday he was placed under house arrest in his luxurious home in the <LOCATION> Florencia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION> suburb of this capital. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, who was dishonorably discharged and stripped of his rank in an unprecedented display of his comrades' ire, is charged in connection with the disappearance of about 130 suspected leftists and the killings of about 30 others. `` If anyone thinks they have evidence against me, let them take it to the courts,'' he told journalists at his home the day after his arrival. `` I have found tranquillity, and fear nothing and no one except God.'' <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, 50, said some of his erstwhile subordinates may have kidnapped or killed suspected subversives, `` and now it's being placed at my feet.'' The ex-general's wife and five children remain in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and plan to join him in June. That is, unless Criminal Court Judge <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, who is hearing <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>' case, takes the unlikely step of ordering him jailed. <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> must decide next week whether to imprison <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> on the basis of available evidence or dismiss the case. Jurists say the charges will likely be dropped. They say that even if there were evidence against him, <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> would benefit from a late-1984 amnesty preventing prosecution for such crimes. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter went to <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>' grand two-story home in an effort to speak with him. But a guard who relayed the request returned to say the former commander decided to make no further comment to the press. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> told journalists the day after his arrival: `` Those who threw me out of this country thought they were throwing me in the garbage. But they threw me into the arms of the Lord and made me a new man.'' A former Roman Catholic, he said last year in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that he converted to evangelical Christianity in 1985 after rereading the Bible. He described the vivid, anguished recollection of all the wrongs he'd ever committed and hours of uncontrollable sobbing. But mothers of the victims of death squads that emerged under the staunchly anti-communist general reject his professed conversion. `` He can not hide behind the Bible,'' said <PERSON> Liduina </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, whose 23-year-old son <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> disappeared in 1982. `` Christ died for the truth, so let <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> begin by telling the truth about what happened to our sons and daughters.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relatives </ORGANIZATION> of the Disappeared, one of two rights groups pressing the case against <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>. She and several other mothers commented at a press conference Wednesday. It was under <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>' command that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration consolidated its use of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in the effort to topple <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government. U.S.-funded rebels established base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> along the Nicaraguan border and the Contras waged most of their 6-year campaign from there. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> also established the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in northern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> during <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>' tenure. The center, now defunct, was used mainly to train government forces from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in counterinsurgency techniques. A year before his expulsion, <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> formed the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, a group of politicians and business leaders. The organization was seen as a vehicle for the general's political ambitions, widely believed to include the presidency. But <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> told journalists after coming back that once his legal problems are resolved, he wants to dedicate himself to a `` normal and private life'' removed from politics. He said last week he would like to settle down in the northern coastal town of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ceiba </LOCATION> and find some sort of business `` to earn me my beans.''

<HEAD>Proponents Say Coin Redesign Would Yield Billions For Treasury</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Advocates of redesigning the nation's pennies, nickels dimes and quarters held out the prospect Friday that excited coin collectors would hand the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> a multi-billion dollar, deficit-reducing, windfall profit. But the director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mint </ORGANIZATION>, testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commttee </ORGANIZATION>, predicted only small-change proceeds ranging in the millions of dollars, not billions. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., said any profit from a redesigned coin would be welcome `` I suspect that glimmer of black ink in our deficit-plagued world is, in itself, adequate reason for passage of this bill,'' he said. Sixty-one senators and 90 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members have co-sponsored legislation authorizing the most sweeping redesign of the nation's coinage since the early years of the century The bill would require a complete redesign of the tails of the coins while reserving the heads for the five presidents presently displayed there. While the presidential portraits might themselves be somewhat redesigned, the coins would retain their present size, shape and color. The bill requires the design of the tail of the quarter to carry for two years a design commemorating the bicentennial of the Constitution. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said he would like to make some changes in the plan and said he will introduce a pair of amendments to do that. He would reserve the face of two of the coins for a symbolic design and forbid their use to portray any person, living or dead. That would mean that two of the five presidents now so honored _ <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> on the penny, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> on the nickel, <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> on the dime, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on the quarter and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on the half-dollar _ would lose their places in the nation's pockets and purses. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said no president was featured on the nation's coins until 1909 when <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was granted the honor on his 100th birthday. Presidents <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> got their coins within a year of their deaths, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said he would also offer an amendment to enhance the value of the redesigned coins as educational tools by directing that they be designed as symbols of such democratic principles as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, due process of law, trial by jury, the right to vote and the separation of powers. `` Coins are the most tangible symbols of our nation in our daily lives,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. `` We touch them, examine them, carry them around in our pockets and purses in all our waking hours. ... People _ particularly young people _ will look at our coins and learn what they stand for.'' <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> who has been campaigning for redesigned coins for more than a year, has said the change could result in a $ 2.3 billion profit over six years. The bill requires all profits be used to reduce the deficit. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, editor of <ORGANIZATION> Numismatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, a coin collector's magazine, testified that the $ 2.3 billion estimate resulted from his calculation of profits of the release of the coins at face value compared to their relatively low production prices and the separate sales of mint and proof sets to collectors `` It is clear to me the government will make money on design changes,'' he said. `` Only the size of the profit is undetermined.'' But <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mint </ORGANIZATION>, had far lower estimates. `` Embellished revenue estimates of $ 2.3 billion have been cited and some have looked to coin redesign as a panacea for budget deficits,'' she said. `` Based on analyses of past demand patterns we estimate $ 224 million in additional ... receipts will be generated in the first six years of the new designs and $ 18 million in additional profits over the same period'' from sales to coin collectors.'' The mint director suggested that if a decision is made to change the design of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coins the changes should be made over a six-year period with a new coin being issued at the beginning of each year.

<TEXT>
 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s new plan to expand blacks' political role was denounced Friday as vague and inadequate, but even some critics credited him with courage. For all their limitations in the eyes of black activists, the proposals sent a clear message to extreme-right whites that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was willing to risk their wrath in pursuit of his version of reform. Parliament members of the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, victor over <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in three recent by-elections, depicted the president's plan as dangerous and said he was `` selling out the white man.'' `` Black power is lying in wait for you,'' said the Conservatives' leader, <PERSON> Andries </PERSON> <PERSON> Treurnicht </PERSON>. `` You're walking straight towards it.'' In a speech to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> proposed black participation in Cabinet-level policymaking and on the electoral college that selects the president. He suggested that blacks, who now may vote only in local elections, could select their representatives in regional balloting. Black and white moderates criticized <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s vagueness and his reluctance to bring blacks into <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. But they praised his willingness to challenge the far right, which consists primarily of the president's fellow Afrikaners. `` As limited as the state president's thought is, it will be used against him by the far right which he now tentatively begins to defy,'' said Zulu leader <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Eglin </PERSON>, leader of the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, softened his usual denunciations of <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to say his party, although skeptical, wished the president success in starting negotiations with leaders of the nation's 26 million blacks. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. More militant anti-apartheid leaders were unimpressed by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s speech, which did not address blacks' fundamental demands for full voting rights and abolition of apartheid laws Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> described <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s proposals as `` slight adjustments to the evil system'' of apartheid. It wo n't help if the government merely `` moved furniture around, because the room would remain the same,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said at the close of a four-day visit to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` Reform will not come by ` big master' throwing to us crumbs of conscience that fall from his table,'' the black archbishop said. `` It will happen when all the people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are able to determine the menu together when they sit at the same table.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, returning to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Friday to explain aspects of the presidential budget, veered from his text to defend his political proposals. Blacks, he said, `` can not be wished away abracadabra'' as the conservatives might hope. He said blacks would have to be brought into the government and given a voice in choosing a president. But <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> also stressed that white voters have a say on the proposal to include blacks in the electoral college. A referendum on this issue would present whites with a clear choice between the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the Conservatives, who oppose any concessions to blacks and favor a strengthening of the apartheid laws that create a racially segregated society. The Conservatives won 26 percent of the vote in the white general election a year ago, and they are predicting further gains in nationwide municipal elections scheduled for October. The vast majority of Conservative supporters are Afrikaners, the mainly Dutch-descended whites who traditionally have been loyal <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> backers. Some political analysts in the country say <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has decided to abandon the far-right Afrikaners in hopes he can attract enough support from English-speaking whites to offset the loss. About 60 percent of the 5 million whites are Afrikaners and the rest are predominantly English-speakers.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent told senators Friday that he almost became the first bureau member initiated into <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Nostra </PERSON>, but his six-year undercover assignment was ended abruptly due to a gangster civil war. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pistone </PERSON> said he would have become a `` made'' member of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> family in December 1981, but he was pulled out of the mob by his <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> superiors after he was ordered to kill a gangster from a rival faction. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> felt _ and so did I _ that this was a good time for getting out, because everybody was being killed,'' <PERSON> Pistone </PERSON> said. But for a brief time, <PERSON> Pistone </PERSON> said, he sought permission to continue the assignment so he could make <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> history. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> said that to this day, no agent has ever penetrated deep enough into a mob family to be a `` made'' member rather than an associate. <PERSON> Pistone </PERSON> testified from behind a screen before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on Investigations. The panel's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., said the retired agent has been relocated from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and changed his appearance Members of the Sicilian Mafia and <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Nostra </PERSON> in this country have used the screen for protection in recent hearings. The committee is looking at the state of organized crime 25 years after ex-mobster <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Valachi </PERSON> testified for the first time about the inner workings of mob families. <PERSON> Pistone </PERSON>, who wrote a book about his life as gangster <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brasco </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> mob was so upset when it learned his real identity, that some of his former allies were murdered, and new rules were instituted to thwart future undercover penetrations. `` They have reinstituted the requirement that before someone is made a soldier, he will have to ` make his bones.' That is, he will have to kill someone,'' <PERSON> Pistone </PERSON> said. `` In addition, they are now requiring two ` wiseguys' -LRB- organized crime members -RRB- to vouch with their own lives for the new member rather than as before, when only one did so.'' The mob had reason to be upset. <PERSON> Pistone </PERSON>'s subsequent testimony resulted in more than 200 indictments and more than 100 convictions of organized crime members. <PERSON> Pistone </PERSON> said there was a `` surprising similarity'' between the workings of organized crime families and terrorist organizations. The families were broken down into small, separate cells called crews. A strict `` need to know'' policy was enforced, with no one asking what other members were doing _ and not giving each other their last names. <PERSON> Pistone </PERSON> described the life of a <LOCATION> Cosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nostra </LOCATION> soldier in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as routine and unglamorous, with most of his time consumed trying to make money for himself and his mob family. `` They did n't think or talk much about their wives, girlfriends, families, hobbies,'' <PERSON> Pistone </PERSON> said. `` Every day you would have to check in with your captain. ... There was no such thing as taking a couple of weeks off for vacation, unless you first had your captain's approval.'' <PERSON> Pistone </PERSON> said mobsters `` believe in God, not in going to church, but they believe in the church. Killing was part of the business. Every Mafia member has in his head that he may be wacked out -LRB- killed -RRB-.'' In other testimony, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> said the <PERSON> Cosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Nostra </PERSON> was `` on the run'' in his city, with most of the organized crime leadership under indictment or in prison. However, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said that despite the successful prosecutions, the mob was `` down but not out'' in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The reputed current boss of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> family, <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, was convicted on extortion and conspiracy charges and sentenced in August 1987 to 14 years in prison. He currently is on trial in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, along with seven <PERSON> Cosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Nostra </PERSON> members, on charges of killing a former `` capo'' in the Scarfo organized crime family. At present, most active members of the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia-South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nostra </ORGANIZATION> `` are either under indictment, in custody, or both,'' he said.

<HEAD>HHS Wants To Transfer Administration To States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said Friday it will soon submit a bill to transfer administration of the federal family planning program from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> to the states. Assistant <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> said the shift would enable states `` to exercise maximum flexibility in tailoring services to more appropriately and effectively meet their citizens' family planning needs. In testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health, <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> said certain federal requirements would be retained. Among them: a ban on use of funds for abortion-related services and priority on serving low-income families. <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> said that by running their own programs, states could not only improve services but could also avoid `` burdensome application, reporting and monitoring requirements in the current program.'' He said legislation proposing the shift would be introduced `` very shortly.'' The Title X family planning program is awarding $ 130 million in grants this year to 89 groups and agencies operating 4,000 clinic sites. Last year the clinics served about 4.3 million people, most of them low-income and about one-third of them adolescents. The administration is trying to put strict new abortion limitations on grant recipients, including a prohibition on any mention of the word by counselors and requirements for separate records, staffs and physical facilities for groups or hospitals that provide abortions as well as family planning. The regulations have been enjoined by courts in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as a result of lawsuits charging they are unconstitutional. <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> regional offices have been instructed for the time being not to implement them.

<HEAD>Police Say Gangs Are Using Homes of Elderly as Drug Houses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drug dealers are either coercing or paying off elderly people to use their homes as safe bases for narcotics sales, authorities say. The statement follows the fatal shooting Wednesday night of 71-year-old L.C. <PERSON> Hadnott </PERSON> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> as police raided his house during a drug sweep. Police said <PERSON> Hadnott </PERSON> pointed a shotgun at officers, but his niece denied that. `` These rock cocaine dealers are using older people's houses to alter the appearance of a rock house ... to give the appearance of an innocent place,'' said Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Costleigh </PERSON>, who's in charge of the Police Department's central narcotics bureau. `` Rock'' is another term for the cocaine derivative also known as crack. <PERSON> Costleigh </PERSON> said police have found an increasing number of elderly people either `` coerced or paid off'' by drug dealers for the use of their homes. The Police Department said Thursday that <PERSON> Hadnott </PERSON> had refused several commands by officers to drop the shotgun he was carrying. He then turned and pointed it at <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wohlfeiler </PERSON>, 36, a 10-year veteran. `` He was in fear for his life and fired one round of a 12-gauge shotgun, wounding <PERSON> Hadnott </PERSON> in the left arm,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Hadnott </PERSON> died hours later during emergency surgery at <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Medical Center. Friends and relatives said Thursday that <PERSON> Hadnott </PERSON> neither aimed a gun at police nor was involved in drug dealing. `` They had to have made a mistake,'' said close friend <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, 41. `` He was an old man, just an old man.'' <PERSON> Hadnott </PERSON>'s niece, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON>, said officers wearing ski masks burst through windows and stormed the house she shared with her uncle. `` He did not have a gun in his hand,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON> said. `` He was trying to ask them what was wrong. They just shot him.'' `` She's lying,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> LAPD </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said undercover officers purchased rock cocaine at the house just before a search warrant was sought, and again prior to the raid. The shotgun, drug paraphernalia and a small amount of cocaine were seized in the raid and <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, 26, was arrested for investigation of selling narcotics. <PERSON> Costleigh </PERSON> said the officers were dressed in dark blue coveralls and were not wearing masks, but added they sometimes pull turtlenecks over their faces to make themselves less conspicuous. The house was one of three raided by police Wednesday night in their continuing battle against street gangs and drug trafficking.

 <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> ignored repeated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaints and agreed to accredit a new ambassador from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> who was a leader of the 1979 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> takeover in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The refusal by several other governments to let the Iranian, <PERSON> Seyed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Malaek </PERSON>, serve as a diplomat in their countries also failed to deter the Swiss from accepting him, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` Our embassy to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, on instructions from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, expressed concern over the presence and proposed accreditation of <LOCATION> Malaek </LOCATION> on several occasions to the government of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> prior to his accreditation as ambassador,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` However, the government of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> agreed to accept him as the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> ambassador,'' she said. She said <PERSON> Malaek </PERSON>'s role in the takeover of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> was `` sufficiently well known'' so that other nations had declined to accept his accreditation. `` We considered it inappropriate for a leader of the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hostage takers who abused diplomatic immunities to be himself accredited as an ambassador,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Widmer </PERSON> said Friday that his government `` did not have sufficient evidence'' to reject <PERSON> Malaek </PERSON>. He said any further comment would have to come from the foreign ministry in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> made known its views to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> `` very forcefully'' before <PERSON> Malaek </PERSON>'s accreditation was accepted and before he left <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to take up his duties in the Swiss capital, <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, in March. The official said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> even sent a diplomat who had been a hostage in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to tell <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> officials about <PERSON> Malaek </PERSON>'s role in the takeover. `` It was to no avail,'' the official said. In May 1986, the Iranians sought to make Malaek the chief of their 14-member diplomatic mission in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government refused to let him take the post. In return, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> refused to accept <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s nominee as its chief representative in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. Another <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said <PERSON> Malaek </PERSON> also was rejected by <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s nomination of <LOCATION> Malaek </LOCATION> to a post in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was withdrawn after the Japanese withheld approval for a lengthy period. <PERSON> Malaek </PERSON>'s fourth turn-down was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rejection of his attempt to come to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as an Iranian envoy at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the official said. <PERSON> Malaek </PERSON> was especially well known to victims of the 1979-1981 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> seizure because he was one of the leading interrogators among the hostage-takers, this official said. Foreign service officers and other Americans were held in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for 444 days until their release in January 1981. Since then, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not had diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and has used the Swiss embassy there to handle any necessary dealings. Swiss diplomats, for example, were the conduits for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s recent letter of protest to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> about a mine that damaged the USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, a frigate patrolling the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes blasted <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla bases in seaside hills south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Friday in the sixth such raid into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. Police said at least one fighter was killed. Eight guerrillas were wounded in the 40-minute attack by eight fighter-bombers that bombed and rocketed a string of targets, police said. Three destroyed positions belonged to the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which claimed responsibility for a guerrilla's hang glider attack on an Israeli army base in November. Six Israeli soldiers were killed and eight wounded in that attack. The group is based in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and is backed by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. It is headed by <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, a former Syrian army captain, and maintains bases in north, east and south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Israeli army command confirmed the raid and said its planes bombed and destroyed <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> guerrilla posts and ammunition depots north of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, provincial capital of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It said in a brief communique that the attacking jets returned safely to base after scoring accurate hits on their targets. Guerrillas fired anti-aircraft guns and Soviet-made SAM-7 Strella missiles on the raiding jets. The Israeli planes released hot air balloons to deflect the heat-seeking projectiles, police said. They said <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport was closed during the air raid. Lebanese police said the attacked positions stretched along a three-mile strip of highlands overlooking the coastal towns of <LOCATION> Damour </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Barja </LOCATION>, about 15 miles south of the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> capital. Eighteen rockets hit the three posts of the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, including a former sponge plant near <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> Damour </LOCATION>, and a two-story building. A jeep-mounted anti-aircraft gun lay charred near a tunnel the group transformed into an ammunition depot. The group's local military commander, who identified himself only by his nom-de-guerre of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Riad </PERSON>, said the tunnel was not hit and ammunition was spared. `` We are targeted because of the current uprising in occupied territories,'' he told reporters. He was referring to Palestinian rioting that has raged in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since Dec. 8. At least 48 people were killed and 63 wounded in the five previous Israeli raids since Jan. 3, when they struck bases of the front in <LOCATION> Barja </LOCATION> and the nearby costal town of <LOCATION> Jiye </LOCATION>, killing 26 people and wounding 30. The last previous attack targeted guerrilla bases in hills southeast of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> on March 24. Nine people were killed and five wounded in that attack.

 A socialite dubbed the `` fugitive temptress,'' who spent six years on the run to avoid trial on charges she and her lover had her husband murdered, has been captured in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, authorities said Friday. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloud </PERSON>, 45, was picked up by the <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, sheriff's department late Thursday, authorities said. She had been missing since 1982. `` I waited a long time for this,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON>, an investigator with the <LOCATION> Mercer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor's office. <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON>, a former state trooper, traveled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with state police Sgt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Blizzard </PERSON> for the arrest. Mrs. Cloud was charged with first-degree murder of her husband, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, who was shot in the yard of their home as the couple returned from a dinner party on Jan. 26, 1980. Cloud, 56, was vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Authorities allege Mrs. Cloud lured her lover, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Corprew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, into the plot to kill her husband, and that <PERSON> Corprew </PERSON> in turn paid <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> II of <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION> $ 2,500 to be the triggerman. <PERSON> Corprew </PERSON> testified that Mrs. Cloud `` was like a spider and I was caught in her web. I could n't get out.'' <PERSON> Corprew </PERSON> was sentenced to one to five years in prison for voluntary manslaughter as part of a plea bargain and was released after eight months. <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> was convicted of first-degree murder in 1984 and sentenced to life in prison. His conviction was overturned by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but he was convicted a second time and again sentenced to life. After she was indicted, Mrs. Cloud moved to <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, where she went to work selling cars and became romantically involved with a former employee of her father's, <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, authorities said. She and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> fled just before her trial was to begin on May 17, 1982, officials said. Mrs. Cloud had put up as her bond a $ 50,000 building she owned in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, but prosecutors said she sold the building before skipping town. Mrs. Cloud contended her husband was murdered by a masked man who emerged from the darkness. She said the assailant demanded money from her husband, then fired a single shotgun blast into his face. <LOCATION> Mercer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said he became suspicious of her story, questioning why the masked man had n't burgled their house while they were away. He also questioned why Mrs. Cloud had been spared. <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON> said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> authorities received a tip about Mrs. Cloud's whereabouts earlier this week and traveled to Kennewick on Thursday. He said they showed neighbors pictures from Mrs. Cloud's wanted poster and staked out her house once they determined the tip was accurate <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON> said no one was home when they arrived at Mrs. Cloud's home about 7:30 p.m He said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> arrived shortly after 8 p.m., and Mrs. Cloud showed up about 11:20 p.m. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> faces no charges and was not arrested, <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON> said.

 Hostages released from the hijacked <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet said Friday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> provided the sky pirates with weapons and explosives while the plane was in northeast <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` It's 100 percent obvious that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was behind the crime. Let there be no doubt about that,'' said <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaferi </PERSON>, 27, a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> security man, who was held captive during the 16-day ordeal. He said a group of men boarded the plane after it landed at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on April 5 with 112 people on board. `` More terrorists boarded the plane at <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> where they produced a submachine gun and explosives they did n't have before,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview at his home. They were disguised as cleaning workers, <PERSON> Zaferi </PERSON> said, `` but their performance was so bad and unprofessional that most of us whispered to each other, ` These must be Iranian security men.''' <PERSON> Zaferi </PERSON>, 21 other passengers and seven crew members arrived home from <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> Thursday, one day after they were freed by the hijackers at <LOCATION> Houari </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boumedienne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The hostages included three cousins of the emir of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> Airways Flight 422 was commandeered on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. It stopped first in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> where 57 hostages were freed. It then went to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, where 13 more were released and two hostages were killed. The plane flew next to <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, where one hostage was released due to medical problems. On Wednesday, the 31 remaining captives were freed, and 29 flew to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The hostages had demanded the release of 17 convicted terrorists jailed for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in 1983, but <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> had refused to do so. Another captive, <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamari </PERSON>, 32, also a businessman, said gumnen boarded the plane in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` They brought arms and explosives aboard the aircraft,'' he said. `` They also brought the plastic straps with which they tied our hands.'' All the hostages said they did not know that two men had been killed in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. They said the two were taken to the front of the aircraft and then disappeared. The exact deal that ended the ordeal in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> is not known. But Arab diplomats have said the hostges slipped away after surrendering the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 and the remaining captives Wednesday. Western diplomats have said the hijackers went to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. But officials at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport denied they landed there. Friday's edition of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified Arab officials as saying the hijackers were flown on a private Algerian jet to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and were believed to have traveled overland to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The officials also were quoted as saying that, with the exception of one Iranian, most of the hijackers were thought to be Lebanese citizens. <PERSON> Zaferi </PERSON> said he knew that the men who boarded the plane where not cleaning workers, `` because I'm an airport security man myself. `` But of course I never revealed my real profession to the hijackers. I told them I am a public relations employee,'' he said. He said that at the start of the hijacking, a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> passenger next to him, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawagh </PERSON>, murmured `` God help me. I do n't think I'll survive it this time ... This is the second time that I endure this experience.'' <PERSON> Sawagh </PERSON> was aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner that was hijacked to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in December 1984 by sky pirates who also demanded the release of the terrorists jailed in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The hijackers killed two American hostages before the Iranians stormed the plane. <PERSON> Zaferi </PERSON> said the hijackers more pillow cases as masks. They also moved the passengers around every few hours. He said they spoke in several dialects, apparently to cover their real identity. But, <PERSON> Zaferi </PERSON> added, `` I'm certain they were all Lebanese.'' <PERSON> Shamari </PERSON> said: `` It was very obvious to us that the hijackers became tense and savage after leaving <LOCATION> Mashad </LOCATION>. `` The hijackers wired the explosives to the doors of the aircraft after landing in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We felt our doom was sealed.'' The former captives said they learned they would be freed suddenly. `` The Algerians told us to cheer up because our ordeal was over,'' <PERSON> Shamari </PERSON> said. `` About half an hour later, we were asked to leave the plane.'' <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and other Arab countries praised <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> for achieving freedom for the hostages without additional violence. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other Western powers criticized <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> for allowing the hijackers to get away.

 Israeli police stormed the holiest Islamic site in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to pursue hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinians after Friday noon prayers. Soldiers shot two Arabs to death in the occupied lands. Police arrested more than 30 Moslem worshipers in the compound of the Dome of the Rock and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosques on <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, which is sacred to both Moslems and Jews. The hill is known in Arabic as <LOCATION> Harim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> es-Sharif </LOCATION>, or Noble Enclosure. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes attacked <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla bases in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The military command said they scored accurate hits on targets north of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> and returned safely. Ten Palestinians were reported wounded in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> during street battles between soldiers and Arabs protesting the assassination of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military commander. He was killed in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> last Saturday by commandos said to be Israelis, and buried Wednesday in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Friday's death brings to 171 the number of Arabs killed since a rebellion began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied since capturing them from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 war. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and Jewish settler also have been killed. About 10,000 worshipers attended prayers on the Moslem Sabbath at <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> and the adjacent Dome of the Rock, the site from which the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> is said to have ascended to heaven on his horse. Afterward, hundreds of people threw stones at police, who responded with rubber bullets and clubs, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> reported from the scene. He said the protesters carried black banners and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has outlawed, and chanted: `` With our spirit and our blood, we will avenge Abu Jihad!'' _ <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s nom de guerre, which means Father of the Holy War. Police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> put the number of arrests at more than 30. He said officers stayed off <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> until the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> stoned a nearby police station, and did not enter the mosques. Six Arabs were reported injured by rubber bullets and beatings, and five Israeli policemen were hurt by stones. It was the most violent confrontation on the sacred site since Jan. 15, when up to 100 Palestinians were treated for the effects of tear gas and a police officer was wounded in a knife attack. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> spent part of his childhood, <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> waved black flags and shouted `` Abu Jihad sacrificed his blood!'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said a Palestinian was killed when soldiers opened fire in <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>. Soldiers wounded 10 Arabs at the <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp near <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials reported 18 injured by rubber bullets or beatings. At <LOCATION> Idna </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, troops shot and killed a Palestinian when he tried to attack a border policeman with a nail-studded club, the army said. Military officials said the soldiers were there to search the village. Many mosque preachers used noon prayers on the first Sabbath in the Moslem holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION> to denounce <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s death and urge the faitful to continue fighting occupation Leaftets were distributed at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> mosques calling for more protests Saturday, which underground <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leaders have designated a `` Day of Rage'' to mark a week since the assassination. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s picture appears on leaflets ordering Palestinians to attack with `` stones, petrol bombs, metal balls and slingshots'' to avenge his death. Soldiers fought protesters after Friday prayers in at least three <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> mosques. Outside the <LOCATION> Omari </LOCATION> mosque in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, troopers hurled tear gas canisters and fired in the air when about 200 young Palestinian left prayers throwing rocks and chanting slogans, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. `` Youths gather! Gather because <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> sacrificed his blood!'' the crowd chanted. In <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, soldiers guarded main intersections and patrolled the streets in trucks and jeeps. Spray-painted on walls were such slogans as: `` The blood of <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> will not go in vain.'' That one was signed by the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. At the <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> mosque in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION>, a preacher told 500 worshipers <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> killed <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> to end the uprising. The Israeli government has not confirmed it was behind the attack. `` They killed him to create despair among the people,'' said <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrar </PERSON>, who exhorted Palestinians to continue the rebellion. <PERSON> Jarrar </PERSON> said the assassination of <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> showed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s arrogance, and declared: `` They plan expulsions, but they will harvest expulsion themselves They plan death, but they will only harvest revenge.''

<HEAD>Protest At University Of Vermont Over Minority Hiring Ends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANICA KIRKA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of minority students and <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> officials reached agreement Friday after all-night negotiations to end the students' four-day occupation of the president's office. The agreement calls for the university to add four to 11 minority faculty members a year for the next four years and to double the number of minority students at the school in the next four years. Minority recruitment of faculty and students has always been a problem for the state university because of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s low minority population. University President <PERSON> Lattie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coor </PERSON> said he was pleased with the agreement, which sets similar but firmer goals than his original proposals. The agreement came four days after 12 to 16 students occupied the president's wing of the administrative building, forcing administrators out of their offices. During the occupation, the number of students varied. The students `` made some concessions'' but `` did achieve all of our goals in principle,'' said one of the students, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Coor </PERSON> said much of the agreement follows general goals he had adopted. `` Right from the beginning we were on a common ground,'' said <PERSON> Coor </PERSON>. `` Is it better because of this? Yes, -LRB- but -RRB- I do n't believe it required the dramatic step -LRB- of the occupation -RRB- to make it occur.'' The students, who also were on a hunger strike, and the administration were far apart until three faculty mediators were called in Thursday night. Of the 8,234 undergraduates at the university, 40 are black, 162 are Asian-American and 66 are <PERSON> Hispanic </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischell </PERSON>, a university official. `` I think we've made a tremendous impact on campus,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's created a certain dialogue on the issue.'' `` There's a lot of ignorance on this campus because it's so white,'' said student <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtenstein </PERSON>. `` People do n't have any idea what the real world is like.'' <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> said because there are so few minority students on campus, issues of racism and cultural diversity are not often raised. `` I think the biggest problem is lack of committment and lack of effort and passivity and ignorance concerning the student body as regards to racism,'' he said.

<HEAD>Source Says Kidnappers Will Release Three French Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three French hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems will be freed soon, a source close to the Syrian army command said Friday. `` Their release is a matter of hours. All arrangements have been worked out,'' said the source, who spoke Friday evening on condition of anonymity. He said the hostages probably would be freed in the vicinity of the seaside Summerland Hotel in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Jnah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, where former French hostages <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Auque </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Normandin </PERSON> were released last November. The hotel is close to south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Shiite slums, where many of the 22 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed held. It also is close to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport. A chartered <ORGANIZATION> Swissair </ORGANIZATION> executive jet flew to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, and a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> security source said it brought Syrian hostage negotiator <PERSON> Omran </PERSON> <PERSON> Adham </PERSON>. But the Lebanese police later denied that <PERSON> Adham </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and said he was not aboard the executive jet. The plane's pilot said after returning to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, `` We went to get the hostages but there were no hostages ready. So we came back to spend the night here.'' The pilot said he would fly to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> again early Saturday morning. He declined to be identified. The <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> weekly magazine <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON> said earlier Friday that contacts were under way between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the release of three Frenchmen held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They are French diplomats <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> and journalist <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>. The three were kidnapped in 1985 by the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War. A fourth Frenchman, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON>, a scientific researcher, was kidnapped May 22, 1985. The Islamic Jihad claimed it killed him March 5, 1986. Although no body has been found, <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, said in a book she published last month that <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officials have confirmed to her that her husband died in captivity. The magazine said <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> had agreed on the release of two French hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in return for `` the release of Iranian assets frozen in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in addition to a $ 1 billion compensation to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' It is believed the magazine referred to full repayment of a $ 1 billion loan made by the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and disputed interest that could amount to an additional $ 1 billion. `` Last minute snags delayed the release,'' the magazine said. It indicated that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s insistance on the release of a third French hostage held up implementation of the deal. The April 5 hijack of a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner by another group of <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> extremists also apparently delayed negotiations. Ash-Shiraa gained international fame in 1986 when it broke the story of secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an atempt to free <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages. In addition to the French captives, 18 other foreigners are missing in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. They are nine Americans, three Britons, a West German, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two unidentified foreign men.

<TEXT>
 Parts of the country are so dry that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has had a special drought task force watching developments for the last seven weeks, officials disclosed Friday. The panel, appointed by <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> on March 1 and headed by Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, has been meeting weekly. Members include heads of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agencies mostly closely associated with farm programs, credit and other resources that might be needed. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said in a statement that <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> is stepping up contact with state agriculture departments in the affected areas so those can `` provide us with a constant flow of information regarding the moisture situation and preparations'' for relief. The <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and other Western states, which suffered through drought last year, appear to be the prime regions for another drought spell in 1988, with several states reporting February and March being the driest on record, he said.

Some other states are having extremely dry weather in smaller areas, raising concerns that forest fires could be severe this year. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said several of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency administrators report that their state and county offices in the dry areas have been received numerous inquiries about various federal drought assistance programs.

 Communist border guards fired a warning shot Friday to block an escape attempt at the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, but a forest ranger and a farm worker successfully fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in separate incidents, officials said. It was the second time this week that East German guards fired shots during an escape attempt at the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, which splits the city into its communist and Western halves. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police said witnesses reported a man running toward <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> territory shortly after 1:00 a.m. with several East German guards in pursuit. The man stopped with his hands over his head after East German guards fired a single shot and was led away by the armed soldiers, police quoted the witnesses as saying. Meanwhile, a 23-year-old East German man avoided communist border guards, climbed over steel-mesh fences and strings of barbed wire to escape to the West German state of <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saxony </LOCATION>, about 100 miles west of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Border police in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> identified the man as an East German forest ranger. Near the Bavarian town of <LOCATION> Coburg </LOCATION>, police said a 22-year-old East German man who was working near the border escaped across the barriers to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> before border guards noticed his flight, police said. Police said the man was an agricultural worker, but they did not say what duties he was performing near the border. Police, who spoke on condition of anonymity in each case, did not release names according to official policy. At least 26 East Germans have escaped over borders into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this year. A 31-year-old East German escaped safely over the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall with a homemade ladder on Tuesday, dodging three salvos of bullets from East German guards.

<HEAD>Bush Aides Say Meese a Political Problem for the Vice President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Aides to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday the legal difficulties surrounding Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> have become a political liability for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and have put the vice president in an awkward position. The <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> affair and what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself refers to as `` this so-called sleaze factor,'' have haunted the vice president on the campaign trail. Hardly a stop goes by without at least one shouted question to him on whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should resign. The Democrats have seized the issue as ammunition against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who makes much of his role in the current administration. And the vice president and his advisers say they expect Democrats to make even more use of the issue as the general election nears. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp handles the issue two ways. In public, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes the part of the loyal vice president, saying he does not wish to prejudge <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, a longtime associate of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s, or to interfere with the legal process. Privately, however, his aides suggest that it would be better for the campaign if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> would go. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides, speaking on condition their names not be used, say the vice president would be relieved if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> would resign. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as one who has been steadfastly loyal to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, has found it difficult to speak out on the issue, they say. The vice president was present at Wednesday's meeting at the White House at which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with two departing <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, who reportedly told the president that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was hurting the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. According to an administration source, former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> outlined a hypothetical indictment he said he would have brought against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> if he had been the special prosecutor investigating the attorney general. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> keys on Friday for a weekend fishing trip with friends, has not commented on the session. A White House official, who also insisted upon anonymity, said that from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s point of view nothing has changed as a result of the session. Another official said the meeting had been arranged by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and not because of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s sensitivities to the problem. It was first talked about when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earlier this month, the official said. While making a point of not criticizing <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> publicly, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> often comes close, telling audiences and interviewers that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should be `` above reproach.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is proposing a new code of ethics `` that will help us avoid the excesses of the past,'' and he speaks of plans to establish a high-level ethics office in the White House. `` People should come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to serve, not to profit,'' he told a Republican gathering in <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, earlier this week. `` When a congressman goes bad, or a member of the executive branch betrays the public trust, you know and I know that it hurts.'' Since last May 11, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has been the subject of a criminal investigation by a special prosecutor examining various issues, including <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s assistance to scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Looking ahead to the general election, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said recently that Democrats `` are like a bunch of fish jumping out at a dry fly, going wild about it. They're going to be going after me _ and I've already heard it _ on this so-called ` sleaze factor.' When asked if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should resign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> usually says that he does n't want to prejudge the attorney general. And he goes on to stress the high ethical standards he says he has heeded throughout his political life.

Every single civil rights bill since 1957, he has opposed. Right up to two weeks ago, when he voted against the recent civil rights bill,'' said history Professor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hine </PERSON>. The board of trustees decided in February to give the honorary doctorate of laws degree to <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> during graduation May 8, school President <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Four petitions are circulating among the faculty calling for the degree not to be awarded to the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hine </PERSON> said, and students are talking about boycotting graduation ceremonies. <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> will accept the award but will be out of the country May 8 on a classified trip with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, press secretary <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hine </PERSON> said most of the 25 faculty members he has talked with have agreed to sign the petitions. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the petition drive wo n't stop the degree from being awarded. `` Certainly we need his support,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> has endowed a scholarship at the school and has helped bring $ 850,000 in federal grants to the school within the past year. He also noted that <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> has been awarded honorary degrees at four other predominantly black schools: <ORGANIZATION> Claflin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Allen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Vorhees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` If he had anything less then an exceptional record on aiding minorities, or if there was anything to these allegations, I feel certain that the other four historically <PERSON> black </PERSON> colleges would have reached the same conclusion,'' he said.

 A 21-year-old servicewoman killed in a terrorist bombing in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> was eulogized Friday at the church where she once sang in the choir, her pastor reminding mourners of their wish for `` one more touch that can not be.'' <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s governor, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers, relatives and friends joined to remember <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> radio operator third class killed April 14 near a USO club in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. Four Italians also died in the bombing, which has been linked to a member of the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> terrorist group. Some 350 mourners packed the Presbyterian Church of <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, where Ms. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> had been in the choir. Her brother and others sobbed as a tape was played of her playing the guitar and singing a song she composed after her maternal grandmother's death. `` I want to thank you for the love and kindness that you gave us,'' Ms. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> sang on the tape as her remains lay in a flag-draped casket flanked by red, white and blue floral sprays. `` It's hard to imagine that something that happened halfway around the world brought us here today,'' the Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Omerod </PERSON>, said in a eulogy. `` Trying to imagine <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> as dead takes all the strength we have. ... It's out of the natural order of things that we bury our children. `` The shock, frustration, anger ... this is the reality of much of life. `` She died at the hands of unforgiving men,'' Omerod said. `` We grieve her loss, wishing one more smile, one more hug, one more touch that can not be.'' Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> attended with his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, and spoke with Ms. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' family after seven <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pallbearers carried the casket out. `` I indicated to the father that as a father, I can feel his loss,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` A terrorist is basically a killer.'' Later, at <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Belleview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> honor guard fired a salute and a buglar played taps. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> gave Ms. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' family a Purple Heart, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Achievement Medal for meritorious service, the Good Conduct Medal and the flag. At the church in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, the suburb of 4,500 where Ms. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> lived while attending high school, the choir sang what members recalled was her favorite song: `` I Will Not Be Afraid.'' Family members had recalled that she had enlisted in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> right out of high school in 1984 instead of accepting college scholarships because she wanted to travel and overcome her shyness. Her brother <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>, 18, said Ms. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> had planned to attend his high school graduation next month. `` You never expect it's going to be you,'' he said. `` I'm angry that it happened to her, but I'm not angry with the military _ they're doing a job.'' Ms. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> was scheduled for discharge this August, but was undecided about whether to re-enlist again or to start college, her family said. She had re-enlisted for one more year last year. Her mother, <PERSON> Ellagene </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, described her daughter as a shy girl who `` wanted to see the world and try her wings.''

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has put the bite on the beef between dueling <LOCATION> Terlingua </LOCATION> chili cookoffs, saying the law offered no recipe for settling this long-simmering range war. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lucius </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> of <PERSON> Pecod </PERSON> said he had no authority to determine which party would have the official world's chili cookoff `` The parties should see this as an issue of good sense and decency and not look to the courts,'' he said Thursday. However, he settled one lesser issue in the suit filed by the faction headed by <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Poteet </LOCATION>, ruling that the rival group founded by the late <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> had no right to call itself the <ORGANIZATION> Chili </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appreciation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Jalapeno <PERSON> Sam </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angelo </LOCATION> armadillo-race promoter, jalapeno lollipop seller and long-time supporter of the <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> group, said there will be no change in the cookoff format. `` We'll still have two chili cookoffs in <LOCATION> Terlingua </LOCATION> the first Saturday in November. We'll identify one as the <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> cookoff and one as the King cookoff,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said Friday. The <LOCATION> Terlingua </LOCATION> cookoffs draw some 200 chili chefs to the mercury-mining ghost town 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, but they are not the biggest in the world. `` The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Chili Championship in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION> draws 300 or 400,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Terlingua </LOCATION> cookoff, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> emphasized, `` is the big cookoff: You cook through the year -LRB- at other competitions -RRB- and receive points to get to <LOCATION> Terlingua </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> _ the author of `` A Bowl of Red,'' the bible of chili _ began the cookoff in 1967. By the early 1980s, he was complaining that the cookoff had become too stuffy and structured, so he bolted and formed the opposition group. `` We're more laid back,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have a lot of rules or regulation. They -LRB- King group -RRB- say you have to have chili a certain color -LRB- red -RRB-, a certain type -LRB- no beans -RRB-. That creates clone cooking.'' <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Goat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gap </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>, the `` clarion of the chili world,'' agreed with <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. `` One guy puts <PERSON> Cracker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacks </PERSON> in his and wins, they all put <ORGANIZATION> Cracker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jacks </ORGANIZATION> in theirs,'' but she said most winners stick to the KISS recipe: Keep It Simple, Stupid. The two <ORGANIZATION> CASI </ORGANIZATION> groups had their own recipe for rivalry: Beginning in 1983, both sides flew the <ORGANIZATION> CASI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> banner at competing events on the same day. Both filed in 1983 for rights to the same name. Both ended up in <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON>'s court. <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> said King had registered the <ORGANIZATION> CASI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> name as a federal trademark, so the <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> group had no right to use it. He found that prior use of the trademark by <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> did not constitute infringement, but that future use by anyone other than the King group would. He ordered <ORGANIZATION> CASI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to pay the <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> heirs $ 1,500 for the cost of the federal trademark, but said the defendants must pay court costs. No attorneys fees were awarded. <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON>'s ruling also waxed poetic on one issue the rivals had n't raised: hot chili `` Some like it hot, some like it cold. Some like it in the pot nine days old. When it comes, however, to good, stout chili, if you do n't like it hot, you're just plum silly,'' his ruling said.

 Hundreds of police and soldiers hunted Friday for bank robbers who escaped at the end of a 24-hour siege with the help of a huge crowd shouting, `` Freedom, freedom.'' Five people were killed, 15 wounded and 42 held hostage and later freed in the assault that ended Thursday at the branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> in this Gulf of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> agricultural town. Unconfirmed reports said the seven robbers took about $ 13,000 from the bank, but neither police nor bank officials would confirm the amount. Police on Friday combed a working-class neighborhood where the young men abandoned a pickup truck and station wagon. Judicial police chief <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> said Friday the search so far has yielded no results. Army soldiers kept watch at the borders of this northwestern state. `` We did not promise pardons. We said the pursuit would begin immediately,'' <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Labastida </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said late Thursday. <PERSON> Labastida </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, who directed negotiations for the release of the hostages, criticized `` irresponsible people who called for turning a tragedy into a political act.'' `` They mobilized people and called on the population to free the hostages, -LRB- and -RRB- the criminals and to take to the street in irresponsible acts that could provoke a great tragedy,'' he said. Mentioning the possibility that `` political agitators'' may have been involved, he added: `` I hope they have not acted with the support or authorization of any political party opposing the government.'' <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> is one of the northwestern states where the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is strong and is the home state of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, the party's candidate in July 6 presidential elections. On Thursday, a crowd of least 1,000 shouting, `` Freedom, freedom,'' surged toward the bank and an armored car as police withdrew to allow the gunmen to escape. The authorities had agreed to provide the gunmen with an armored car and let them take three <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers hostage. Some of the crowd crawled atop the vehicle and stayed with it for several blocks as it sped from the crime scene. Police sharpshooters on rooftops around the bank were unable to act because of the crowd. <PERSON> Labastida </PERSON> said the final police report listed four deaths _ two bank employees, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker and a policeman. However, police said Thursday that five people, including two policemen, were killed. Police said the gunmen released the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> hostages, abandoned the armored car and stole a pickup and station wagon about 15 minutes after they fled. Hostage <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Angulo </PERSON>, who drove the armored car, said five gunmen, one of whom had an arm wound, fled in the truck and two others apparently mixed in with the crowd. He said they had `` sawed-off machine guns, ammunition and dynamite sticks,'' the latter tied to their bodies. The gunmen took the hostages after police responded to an alarm about a robbery attempt. The deaths and injuries occurred in the ensuing shootout. Hundreds of police surrounded the bank in this city of 120,000 during the siege. A local <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker said Attorney General's Office officials took his three colleagues who were used as hostages during the escape `` to an undisclosed location,'' apparently to interrogate them. Bank robberies and other crimes have increased in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since the onset in 1982 of an economic crisis that has driven up prices and unemployment. <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> is known as a crime center, particularly for the illegal narcotics trade. The Attorney General's Office and the army have an ongoing campaign against production and trafficking of narcotics in the region.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Friday of violating a month-old cease-fire agreement with rebel forces by sending food shipments to Contra camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON>, was called back to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> for `` urgent consultations'' on the issue, embassy political counselor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 47.9 million humanitarian aid package for the rebels three weeks ago, and 69,000 pounds of rice, beans and other food items were sent to Contra camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> near the Nicaraguan border this week. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> contends that the temporary truce signed on March 23 permits deliveries of humanitarian aid only to Contras assembled in mutually agreed cease-fire zones inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deliveries a violation of the agreement. He said <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> plans to return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The leftist Sandinista government and the rebels have designated seven cease-fire zones where the Contras are to assemble but have not yet reached agreement on ground rules governing there presence in these areas. Thus, the Contras have not yet resettled in the zones even though an April 15 deadline had been set for their resettlement. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, a member of the directorate of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the rebels' formal name, told reporters Friday that large numbers of Contras have fled across the border to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in recent weeks because of food shortages in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He denied that the shipments to Contra camps represented a violation of the truce agreement. The Sandinista government maintains that the agreement specifies that the aid is to be delivered to rebels in the cease-fire zones by `` neutral organizations'' and that a verification commission must ensure compliance. The Secretary General of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, is one of two commission members. He was due to interrupt a trip to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Friday night and to return to <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to review the controversy over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food shipments, an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. An <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said Thursday the shipments were sent from the Honduran capital of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> after being inspected by independent observers, including Honduran clergymen. These were the first deliveries of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the rebels since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off all assistance to the rebels on Feb. 29. The $ 47.9 million package, which includes food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies, was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a week after the March 23 truce was signed. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> told reporters the number of rebels on the Honduran side of the border has swelled in recent weeks to 3,000 to 4,000 because of the food shortages in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. It was not clear, however, how many rebels were in that area prior to the recent exodus from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. At the time of the truce agreement, there were an estimated 12,000 Contra fighters in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Rebel forces in jungle and mountainous regions in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> face `` a very difficult situation,'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said. He added that the troops will be ordered to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> once U.S.-sponsored food shipments inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> begin. Sandinista and rebel negotiators will resume their discussions on April 28 in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said he believes the differences between the two sides over ground rules in the cease-fire zones can be ironed out quickly.

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Friday accused Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of failing to understand `` what it takes to build an economic future and to create good jobs.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, attacking on what could be a major general election issue, said, `` I do n't see how we are going to bring good jobs and good wages back to the industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> unless we work together. If the vice president does n't understand that, then he should n't be running for president.'' The Democratic front-runner also criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the all-but-sure <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee, for saying he wants to be `` the education president.'' `` How can he say that after the last seven years?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked a crowd of students at <ORGANIZATION> Mercyhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` After seven years of an administration that has slammed a door in the face of millions of youngsters looking for a chance to go to college? After seven years of treating education ... as if it were a privilege for the few, instead of a right and a necessity for every American?'' As for his own proposals, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called for a national teaching excellence fund and an education security fund to boost teachers and to make more college loans available to students. He said his ideas would cost an additional $ 250 million in federal spending. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor had nothing but praise for his remaining Democratic rival, saying he and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have to work together in the `` spirit of friendship'' for victory in the general election. Friday night, he faced <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the first one-on-one debate with the newly reduced field. Asked if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is less likely to be his running mate after a poll said such a move would cost the Democrats votes in the fall, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` No, I never pay any attention to polls.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a full campaign day across <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, seeking blue-collar votes in the nation's industrial heartland. The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary is next Tuesday, with <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> voting the next week. `` You're looking at someone who is a true-blue, dyed-in-the-wool, full-employment Democrat,'' he told workers outside a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Maumee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> plant near <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> and a steel plant in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> emphasized his support for government working in partnership with business and labor to save jobs. Asked by a reporter about a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> statement that government should stay out of the private sector, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> replied at a <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> airport news conference: `` I do n't think the vice president understands what it takes to build an economic future and to create good jobs. There are governors and mayors, businessmen and women, labor leaders ... working together across this country.'' `` Government should n't do it all. I'm a strong believer in the free enterprise system, but we need a president who will be a strong partner for you here in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> ... who will help with some resources, some support,'' he said. `` It's the public-private partnerships that are making the difference all over the country. That's what I've been doing'' in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also criticized President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for threatening to veto the congressional trade bill because of its plant-closing provisions. He took <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to task for repeating his veto pledge Thursday in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` The irony is that he chose to deliver that speech in the one state that has a comprehensive plant-closing law that works and works well,'' he told about 100 workers standing in a cold wind outside the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> plant. Later <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> strengthened his criticism of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` It would be a tragedy if the trade bill that has been worked on hard and that now is a responsible piece of legislation would be vetoed because of something we should have done a long time ago,'' he told reporters in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>. `` A very modest, very mild 60-day notice provision seems to me to be just simple justice for workers and working families.''

<TEXT>
 With lessons learned from the <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> evacuation, <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials are preparing for the possibility of a hasty civilian evacuation from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` I guess that the national network interviews of Americans in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> made me think in terms of that. Basically, it's just headlines until you start seeing people and their concerns about things like that,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. During the past three weeks, social services employees have been assembling `` survival boxes'' containing items ranging from registration forms to diapers. They also have a stockpile of quarters for any new arrival who might need to make a telephone call. The repatriation would be similar to the last-minute handling of the more than 500 evacuees flown to the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> after the 1983 invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON>. Though the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> has not been designated a civilian evacuation landing zone, <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> said it is the most logical and convenient for the large aircraft known to supply American bases in Central America. `` We were very lucky with <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> because this line of government dealt with that line of government right up to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. But with something like an evacuation, you never know what may happen,'' he said. `` It's just been a prudent ground effort to muster the resources of an agency at a minute's notice,'' he said. `` We do n't want to be in a position of having to run around looking for this and that.''

He said their designation is in keeping with an initiative President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> outlined last year in which government and industry will work together to find commercial applications for high-temperature superconductors, which can conduct electricity without energy loss. `` Superconductors ... have great potential in such areas as electrical generation, storage and transmission, computers, communications, medical diagnostics and transportation,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. `` However, the newly discovered materials will require extensive research and development.'' All three laboratories have been active in superconductivity research and have the facilities and expertise needed to make the technology marketable, <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said.

 A fire science specialist will examine the wreckage of a commuter plane that crash-landed at <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with one of its two engines on fire, federal investigators said Friday. <PERSON> Merrit </PERSON> <PERSON> Berke </PERSON>, a government fire science expert, will look at burn patterns on the <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Havilland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dash </ORGANIZATION> 8 `` and try to help us determine where the fire originated,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Benzon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, the pilot of the <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> plane issued a statement praising his crew and ground personnel in handling the April 15 crash, in which 19 of the 40 people on board were injured. Three remain hospitalized. `` We did our jobs. ... Under the circumstances, the crew of Flight 2658 performed and handled the emergency the way we were trained,'' pilot <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, who has declined public comment since the crash, said Thursday. `` Beyond those of us on the aircraft, the emergency crews on the ground performed flawlessly,'' he said. The plane's right engine burst into flames shortly after takeoff, and <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> later told investigators he had trouble controlling the craft when he returned to the airport. When the plane touched down, the last words from <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> heard by the airport control tower were `` I'm out of control,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Boniberger </PERSON>, an air traffic controller. He said Thursday that <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> sounded calm, but became more excited while the plane touched down and hurtled down the runway. Controllers could see flames and smoke from the engine while the plane descended, <PERSON> Boniberger </PERSON> said. He said the plane did not appear to be out of control in the air, and that the pilot did n't mention the difficulty until landing. <PERSON> Benzon </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s chief investigator on the crash, said that despite the fire, the plane could have been expected to remain on the runway during the landing. Instead, it veered off the runway, went across a strip of grass, and crashed into passenger gates at the main terminal. No one on the ground was injured. Investigators hope <PERSON> Berke </PERSON> can help determine the source of the fuel leak involved in the fire and the source of ignition, <PERSON> Benzon </PERSON> said. Investigators believe the fuel may have spilled from a loose fuel pump, he said. The plane's two engines were sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> factory in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and other parts were sent to their manufacturers as part of the investigation.

 Subway gunman <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> can keep any money he makes from selling his story, the chairman of the state <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The four-member board decided unanimously that the state `` Son of Sam'' law does not apply to <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, said Chairman <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Petromelis </PERSON>. The board made the ruling March 17 in response to a petition filed by <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, he said. The board said the crime profits law did n't apply because the jury that tried <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> determined that the four teen-agers he shot were not crime victims. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> was acquitted of assault, attempted murder, reckless endangerment and all but one weapons charge. Under the `` Son of Sam'' law, any profits made by convicts who sell the stories of their crimes are held in escrow by the board for the person's victims. The law was created in 1979 to prevent `` Son of Sam'' killer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkowitz </PERSON> from profiting from book and movie deals about his year-long crime rampage, which left six people dead and seven wounded. A judge last year ordered that more than $ 118,000 <PERSON> Berkowitz </PERSON> received for the rights to his story should be turned over to families of his victims. According to <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Brindle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> has yet to sell the story of the subway shooting. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> was convicted in June 1987 of one count of third-degree weapons possession in the shooting of four 19-year-olds on a subway Dec. 22, 1984. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> maintained that the teen-agers were trying to rob him when they approached and asked for $ 5. The youths said they were panhandling. Neither <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> nor his lawyer were immediately available for comment. There was no answer at <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s home phone. Lawyer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Slotnick </PERSON> did n't return calls. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> was sentenced to six months in jail and 4 -LCB- years probation but is free on $ 5,000 bail pending appeal. The ruled March 17, but the ruling was mailed to involved parties this week and released publicly Friday, said <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Felegy </PERSON>, counsel to the board.

 Explosions and gunfire were heard at the government's main air force base on Friday, but officials would not say what had occurred. The sounds of gunshots, helicopters and explosions filled the air starting at about 7:30 p.m. -LRB- 10 a.m. EDT -RRB- at the base in <LOCATION> Katunayake </LOCATION>, about 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Sepala </PERSON> <PERSON> Attygalle </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said `` there has been an explosion and some shooting at the <LOCATION> Katunayake </LOCATION> air force base, but I do n't have details.'' Air Marshall A.W. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> also declined to explain what had occurred. Residents living nearby said there were reports that airmen were attacking each other and that more than 20 were injured. They spoke on condition of anonymity. The base is at the northern edge of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>'s international airport. On June 8, the base was attacked by the <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a group of nationalist Sinhalese. Sentries repulsed the attack and killed two intruders. Scores of arrests followed. The front was outlawed after an abortive 1971 effort to overthrow the Sri Lankan government, but it began regrouping in 1986. Initially a radical Marxist group, it now champions the cause of the island's majority Sinhalese. The front has opposed the peace accord signed last July by <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to try to end a five-year separatist rebellion by Tamils in the north. The Sinhalese group contends the pact makes too many concessions to the Tamil minority and has vowed to kill anyone who supports the accord. Tamils, who comprise about 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, claim they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who control the government and military. Tamils are mostly Hindus while the Sinhalese are Buddhists.

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge Friday refused to grant a mistrial in a smoking liability lawsuit, saying he was satisfied that an opinion he issued that was critical of three tobacco companies had not prejudiced the jury. Defense attorneys for the cigarette makers requested the mistrial, arguing that the opinion issued Thursday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> had generated inflammatory headlines. In the opinion, <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> dismissed some of the claims against the companies _ <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ but rejected the companies' request to dismiss the entire lawsuit. The judge said the jury will decide whether the companies covered up the dangers of smoking based on evidence that indicates `` a tobacco industry conspiracy, vast in its scope, devious in its purpose and devastating in its results.'' The suit, filed by <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>, 64, of <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION>, says the cigarette makers bear responsibility for the death of <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, who died at age 58 in 1984 after smoking for 40 years `` I know that jurors say they have n't seen anything when they have,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bleakley </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, said in arguing for a mistrial. `` I do n't think anything can be done about the prejudice that has already taken place.'' <PERSON> Bleakley </PERSON> pointed to a headline in an area newspaper that said `` Judge Finds Conspiracy.'' <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> questioned each juror individually in his chambers, and emerged 45 minutes later and had the court clerk reread the questions he asked as well as each response of the jury. In the remarks, the judge told each juror that in the past two days, there had been a great deal of publicity about the case and that he wanted to learn if they knew of it. One man said all he ever reads is the comic strips and that the evening news is all `` malarkey,'' the court clerk read. Five jurors said they had heard some outside comment on the case but had followed the judge's instructions not to discuss it. `` I am entirely satisfied that the answers of the jury are entirely credible,'' <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> told attorneys before recalling the jury. `` There is no evidence whatsoever that the jurors were prejudiced. It insults them to suggest that they would now lie to the court.'' <PERSON> Bleakley </PERSON> said that was never his contention. `` I did not accuse any juror of lying,'' <PERSON> Bleakley </PERSON> said. `` But there were highly inflammatory headlines and there should be a presumption that publicity was received.'' In rejecting the defense's request Thursday to dismiss the entire lawsuit, <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> wrote, `` If the jury accepts the plaintiff's version of the facts as to the conduct of the defendants, it is difficult to envision a more compelling case for an award of punitive damages.'' <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> did dismiss claims that the three companies caused Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s cancer by not marketing a safer cigarette and by failing to conduct adequate research into the health effects of smoking. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s attorneys say the trial, which began Feb. 1, breaks new ground because for the first time a plaintiff's lawyers had access to confidential files of tobacco companies and trade groups detailing their public relations strategies. Defense attorneys contend Mrs. <PERSON> Cippolone </PERSON> smoked of her own free will and was an intelligent, independent woman who knew the dangers smoking poses.

<HEAD>Officials, Journalists Recommend Easing Of Travel Restrictions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American and Soviet officials and journalists on Friday closed an unusual conference on information policy with a recommendation that both governments ease travel restrictions on each other's journalists. The meeting resulted from a conversation at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last December involving <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, his politburo colleague <PERSON> Aleksandr </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. One discussion panel made a recommendation to `` urge our respective governments to take reciprocal steps to ease travel restrictions on journalists,'' <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> told a news conference. <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> and the head of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation, <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>, chairman of the semi-official <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> news agency, stressed that the panel's recommendation did not mean either government would change its policies. `` In strict compliance with what has been said by the American side, the Soviet side on its return -LRB- to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> -RRB- will report to the competent Soviet agencies all the wishes that have been expressed and all the proposals and considerations that have been expressed during the meetings,'' said <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>. The number and movements of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet journalists in the respective countries are tightly controlled by the governments. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> journalists living in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and Soviet journalists living in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, can not travel more than 21 miles outside those cities without prior approval from the host government. The <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords of 1975 eased some of restrictions on the work and movements of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet journalists in each other's countries, but many remain For example, some cities and regions in each country are closed to reporters and journalists from the other. <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, reading from a statement approved by one discussion panel, said: `` The group clearly felt that closed cities should be gradually opened and other restrictions on coverage should be lifted. Previous historical arguments about their origin should be abandoned.'' Soviet officials have said in the past that they imposed the restrictions in response to American actions. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, however, say that the Soviets imposed the travel restrictions after <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> invaded in 1941, and left them in place after the war. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government imposed similar restrictions on the movement of Soviet journalists in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1950s. <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> said the conference panel discussing the print media `` mutually agreed to undertake, under the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>, and equivalent Soviet entities, a survey of print media coverage to be performed by competent academic institutions selected by each side and reviewed by professional journalists.'' `` The aim here is to address the innaccurate media stereotypes each society has of each other,'' said <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>. `` There is recognition among panel members that access and coverage possibilities for journalists be maintained in the bad times as well as the good times. Perhaps even more so,'' the statement said. `` It was agreed that in times of tension accurate reporting provided by such access was all the more desirable.''

 <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON> has been a civil servant, a manufacturer and clothier in the 46 years since his doctoral dissertation was rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. Now he's finally going to get his Ph. D and recognition for trailblazing `` There was n't a time I did n't feel completely frustrated,'' said <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON>, now 77 and retired in <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, Md. `` I would meet a Ph. D and think, that's what I should be. `` I would go to one of my stores in the morning and think, ` What am I doing here, opening a store?''' he added in a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` I spent 40 years doing things I really did n't want to do.'' <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON> was a graduate student when he submitted his dissertation to the political science faculty at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1942. He argued that the nation's early leaders, among them <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, had intended to use the federal government's powers to develop the fledgling nation's resources through public works and other projects. <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON>'s dissertation was rejected. It may have sounded like heresy at the time. The paper challenged the then-common conviction that the New Deal social programs of President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> marked a departure from laissez faire principles attributed to the founding fathers. <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON>'s idea has since gained wide acceptance through the work of other historians, notably <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in his recent book, `` Cycles of American History.'' <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON> decided after reading <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>'s book last year to make a new effort to gain acceptance for his dissertation, now titled, `` Affirmative Government in the Early American Economy.'' He sent <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> a summary of his work, setting in motion a process that will culminate later this spring when <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON> finally receives his doctorate at commencement. `` We're just not handing out a degree,'' said Professor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cropsey </PERSON>, the political science department's director of graduate studies and a member of the three-man committee that reviewed the dissertation last fall. `` He earned it.'' `` I was n't even born when he wrote this, so I simply treated it as a revised draft,'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Orfield </PERSON>, a political science professor at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and also a member of the review committee, said Friday. `` But it had been updated. There were many sources added that came long after the first paper was submitted,'' <PERSON> Orfield </PERSON> added. `` It's a testament to his grit. He is the kind of guy everybody should want to be at his age _ determined, committed, pressing forward. I think he's a real inspiration.'' A letter from <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, who calls <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON>'s dissertation `` a strikingly original piece of work,'' and prodding by several other scholars helped to bring about the review. Among <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON>'s supporters was <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchett </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, a retired chairman of the political science department at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> who is listed as a member of the original faculty review committee. <PERSON> Pritchett </PERSON> said he does not recall the original dissertation. But after reading it recently at <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON>'s request, he urged a reappraisal. `` I thought it was a tremendous job,'' <PERSON> Pritchett </PERSON> said in a telephone interview with the Times. `` I simply could n't understand how it could have been rejected.'' Though no one knows why the original dissertation was rejected, it is believed the retirement of <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON>'s mentor and Ph. D adviser played a role When <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON> learned of the rejection, he was married, had a child and a job and could n't return to campus as a full-time student to revise his manuscript. <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON> went on to manufacture light fixtures, owned a chain of men's clothing stores in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and became a federal civil servant, becoming regional director for the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION>, supervising a five-state region in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Now <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON>'s philosophical about his study's long-awaited vindication. `` It's really a crazy story,'' <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON> said.

 One-ounce amber bottles of <ORGANIZATION> Brite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> brand ipecac syrup and <ORGANIZATION> Brite </ORGANIZATION> Life Iodides Tincture, an iodine, are being recalled nationwide because of a labeling error, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Some bottles of the iodine were mislabeled as ipecac syrup, which is used to produce vomiting after a suspected poisoning. Iodine, while potentially harmful if swallowed in large amounts, would not likely to cause harm in such a small dose, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The problem stemming from the mislabeling is that iodine would not induce the desired vomiting, said spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON>. The recall affects <ORGANIZATION> Brite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> ipecac syrup Lot 004715 with expiration date 7-92 and <ORGANIZATION> Brite </ORGANIZATION> Life Iodides Tincture Lot 004713 with expiration date 2-92. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said the mislabeled bottles of iodine may also be identified by the presence of a plastic applicator rod visible in the bottle. The manufacturer, Humco Laboratory of <LOCATION> Texarkana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, found 18 mislabled iodine bottles inside its facilities and notified the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and its distributors. About 12,000 bottles of the ipecac and 4,500 bottles of iodine of the affected lots have been distributed since last September, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. Any bottles covered by the recall should be returned to the place of purchase, the agency said.

 Evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> told listeners at <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> seminary Friday that he believes a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> revival is occurring in Communist-ruled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He told about 250 students and faculty at the <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> Union Theological Seminary that Americans are going to church more and becoming more religious. `` And among the Christians in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, I feel the same thing in just the short time I've been here _ that people are turning to Christ in great numbers,'' he said. Some people sat on wooden chairs in the aisles and others stood in the doorways of the packed chapel to hear the Southern Baptist minister. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said a high-level government official told him `` that the church in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> grows most when there's persecution.'' The audience laughed when <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said the official, whom he did not identify, joked that `` maybe the best way to evangelize <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is to have much persecution.'' Christianity has never had a strong following in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> despite centuries of missionary work by Western countries before the communist takeover in 1949. During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, Christians were persecuted. Churches were turned over to secular groups or destroyed and many believers were tortured and jailed. In recent years, the government has allowed religious activities to resume, but it administers all such activity through the Bureau of Religious Affairs. An estimated 4 million Protestants worship in 4,000 state-sanctioned churches, but millions more are believed to meet privately in their homes. An estimated 3 million Catholics belong to the government-supervised <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which does not recognize the authority of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> pope. Millions of other Catholics are believed to remain loyal to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and worship in secret. The government has no relations with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, which recognizes the rival Nationalist Chinese government on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> spoke for about an hour at the seminary, which has 170 students, lecturing on how to preach effectively. The 69-year-old evangelist, who has preached in 70 countries, told his listeners to preach the Gospel with authority, simplicity, repetition and urgency. During a question-and-answer period, a student asked how to preach Christianity in an officially athiestic country such as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` In the same way,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> replied. `` I'm not sure there are genuine athiests,'' he added. The Nanking Seminary is the only one in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that accepts students from all over the country. Ten smaller <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> seminaries accept only students from their areas and have a total of enrollment of about 600. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, and son, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, traveled to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> later Friday. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> is making his first visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He arrived April 12 and spent a week in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> where he met with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Grahams </ORGANIZATION> also visited <LOCATION> Huaiyin </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> province where Mrs. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, the daughter of a mission doctor, spent the first 17 years of her life. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> is scheduled to visit <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> before leaving <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on April 28.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sought on Friday to bolster his support in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area, where he already has the support of the mayor and a major newspaper for Tuesday's state Democratic primary. Friday night, he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were to debate at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> in their first meeting since <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> suspended his bid for the Democratic nomination after a disappointing third-place finish in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. At <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was greeted at a rally by about 1,000 students, including about 200 waving blue and white placards for Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The placards were distributed before the rally by a campus Republican group. At the close of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s remarks, a dozen of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters began chanting the vice president's name as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> led the crowd in a cheer of his own: `` Stop drugs. Save jobs.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> talked of his competition with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in his remarks, contending they were virtually even. `` The field once was crowded, but now there are three, three survivors ... <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and me, and here we are and here we go,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` We're running neck and neck. I'm a long-distance runner and I do n't lose stride.'' His aides noted that he is close behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in total votes in primaries to date, although <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has a substantial lead in delegates to the national convention. On Saturday, the two remaining Democrats planned to meet in another debate in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support is uncertain. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met with editorial boards of the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and the Inquirer Friday morning, then canceled an early afternoon appearance in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> before heading for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION>. He renewed his criticism of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Central American policies, telling the students, `` Your generation must go beyond war in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We're not threatened by three million Sandinistas. And, if so, we ca n't be saved by 15,000 Contras.'' Alluding to the administration oft-quoted contention that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is the `` back door'' to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the nation is actually `` next door'' and a possible ally. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also questioned the administration's commitment to student aid. `` If you were about to lose your scholarship, who would you want to argue your case?'' he asked. `` When I win, you win. When I win, scholarships win.''

<HEAD>Reagan Says Congress Caved in to Organized Labor With Trade Bill</HEAD>
<HEAD>DESK: SUBS 8th graf pvs, bgng: Byrd said, with vote tentatively
scheduled for Tuesday.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday charged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with caving in to organized labor with its trade bill but supporters of the measure said it was his `` wishful thinking'' that a veto would win him a version he prefers. The president has promised to veto the bill because of a provision requiring all but the smallest employers to give 60 days notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. As the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> began debate on the sweeping trade measure Friday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a group of conservative state legislators that the plant-closings provision `` would make American industry less competitive.'' `` Put simply, on key provisions in the trade bill, the Democratic leadership in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has caved in to pressure from organized labor,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` If this bill is unloaded on my desk, I'll stamp it reject and ship it back to where it was made.'' The House on Thursday passed the bill, with Democrats achieving more than the two-thirds vote needed to override a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto. The White House continued lobbying senators on Friday to vote with the president, arguing it would force <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to send him a bill without the plant-closing provision. `` That's wishful thinking,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate began If enough senators voted to sustain the veto, `` we would be taking a severe chance in not having this legislation become law,'' he said, `` And I would argue that we not gamble.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote on the 1,000-page bill was expected on Tuesday, and although confident it would pass he was not sure he could muster the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote on the legislation was 312-107. If the president's veto were sustained, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said the trade bill _ a product of years of work and a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> compromise on competing bills that passed last year _ would have to start from scratch in the process. `` This matter is not going to be turned around that easily and that quickly,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said, noting there were 170 amendments the last time it was before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, emphasized the broad scope of the measure, which was being obscured by the very specific veto fight. Among its hundreds of provisions, the bill gives new powers to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative, repeals the windfall profits tax on oil and relaxes controls on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports of high technology equipment. `` We have n't had a trade policy ... since World War II,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. Although the nation did well without one when it was the dominant world economic power, `` that time has since changed and now we're in tough competition,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., said he, like many Republicans, wanted to support their president but he would vote to override `` I hope that when senators vote on this bill they have their eyes open to the consequences,'' he said of the hot election-year issue. `` It is by no means certain that this bill can be saved in some other form.'' The leaders of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, at which much of the trade bill was aimed, made clear Friday they would welcome its demise. Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON>, in a nationally televised news conference, said relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would suffer but said he had `` strong expectations'' the legislation would die. <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON>, minister for international trade and industry, said he `` deeply regretted'' House passage of the bill. `` While I do not think it will be passed in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in the end, I will urge the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration -LRB- to block the bill -RRB- and await the common sense of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON> said. The bill includes two provisions regarded as threatening to Japanese business. One is the provision giving the trade representative power to decide what constitutes unfair trade practices by another country, and what to do about it. Another imposes sanctions against <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which sold submarine-silencing equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in violation of a Western trade agreement on sensitive technology exports.

 An inmate who claims he inherited $ 2.5 million may not have to wait for freedom to start spending it, state officials said Friday, because if he really has the money they want him to fork over room and board. `` It seems only fair ... for inmates who have the resources to repay their debt to society, while they're paying their debt to society,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairchild </PERSON>. `` We're going to go after the money if it's there.'' <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Fieldman </PERSON>, convicted of robbing a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> cab driver of $ 60 at knifepoint on Dec. 27, 1986, told authorities at <ORGANIZATION> Joliet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> his mother died and left him the money, officials said. But `` we're not sure that he has in fact inherited $ 2.5 million,'' Fairchild said. `` He has supplied nothing to us other than a death certificate for his mother, which is a year old.'' If <PERSON> Fieldman </PERSON>'s claim is true, corrections officials plan to seek a court order to make him pay for the estimated $ 16,000-a-year cost of housing, Fairchild said. <PERSON> Fieldman </PERSON>, who began serving an eight-year sentence March 25, could be eligible for early release for good behavior in four years, Fairchild said. He would run up a tab of about $ 64,000 for a four-year stay, about the amount he would receive in interest on the inheritance in that period, the spokesman said. <PERSON> Fieldman </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, apparently fears greedy inmates who got word of the purported windfall, and was moved to protective custody earlier this week at his own request, Fairchild said. The <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has launched an investigation to determine if the woman named in the death cerificate, who died in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, was in fact <PERSON> Fieldman </PERSON>'s mother, and to see if she did leave him the money, Fairchild said. He declined to release the woman's name or any additional information about her. Recovering costs from inmates `` is not something that we've routinely done in the past because usually inmates do n't have those kind of assets,'' Fairchild said But requiring <PERSON> Fieldman </PERSON> to pay for room and board would not be unprecedented, he said. State law authorizes the Corrections Department to seek legal action `` to attach inmates' assets for the purpose of reimbursing the state for costs of incarceration,'' he said. Work-release inmates housed at community correctional centers must pay for room and board, Fairchild said. `` About 20 percent of their take-home pay is deposited in an account that helps pay for their incarceration,'' he said, adding, `` Last year that raised almost half a million dollars for the department.'' Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> said he had never heard of costs being recovered from federal inmates. Inmate costs are covered by the federal budget `` and as far as I know the government has always paid all of it,'' he said from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A committee settled a feud Friday between two groups competing to take the dramatic story of toddler <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>'s rescue from an abandoned well to television. The choice of a Los Angeles-based firm satisfied the two groups of rescuers, civic leaders and <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>'s parents, ending nearly two months of dissension that had split this <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city, officials said. The two contending groups were municipal workers who participated in the rescue and a group of volunteers. A five-member panel Mayor <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> appointed to settle the spat chose a television movie proposal from Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Interscope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> over one from producer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Highland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The selection of <ORGANIZATION> Interscope </ORGANIZATION> and word from the <ORGANIZATION> McClures </ORGANIZATION>' attorney that negotiations will begin between the family and the film company appeared to halt the months-long battle for movie rights to <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>'s story. `` The <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> rescue story is the type of story which should be told because it exemplifies the noblest aspects of the human spirit,'' said committee Chairman <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> banker. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> was 18 months old when she fell into the well in a neighbor's yard Oct. 14. Rescuers, many of them oilfield workers, dug a shaft through solid rock to save the toddler in a televised 58-hour effort that drew international attention. Proposals from <ORGANIZATION> Interscope </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON> were among dozens of proposals initially pitched to the <ORGANIZATION> McClures </ORGANIZATION> and workers involved in the rescue. The flood of offers prompted the formation of two rescuer's groups after disagreements arose over rights negotiations. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> appointed the committee after both groups agreed to abide by the decision of the panel. `` The effort that was made to reconcile was as as great as the -LRB- rescue -RRB- effort in October,'' said <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON>. One group remains committed to a deal with <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON>, but spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON> said his group endorsed the committee's decision and will talk to <PERSON> Spivey </PERSON> next week. That group consists of more than 30 volunteers. Another group, consisting mainly of municipal employees, announced Friday it had disbanded because its purpose, finding a producer, had been served. `` It is hoped that -LRB- the disbandment -RRB- will permit the successful producer to deal individually with all the people in <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> which the producer deems necessary to portray an accurate and all-encompassing true-life story of <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>'s rescue,'' said police Cpl. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. Details remain to be worked out, said committee members. The <ORGANIZATION> Interscope </ORGANIZATION> proposal listed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kander </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> as co-executive producer with <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, who will write the script. <ORGANIZATION> Interscope </ORGANIZATION> has produced such television movies as `` Murder Ordained'' for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and such feature films as `` Three Men And A Baby,'' `` Outrageous Fortune'' and `` Revenge of the Nerds.'' <ORGANIZATION> Interscope </ORGANIZATION> called the story `` an important and positive reflection not only of the strength of the human spirit, even that of a small child, but of the strength of a community when it is banded together at the heart.'' The movie will be sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and will be shown on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, officials said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed legislation Friday designed to police traffic in mislabeled drugs, but said he will seek repeal of a provision requiring states to follow federal standards in licensing wholesale drug distributors. `` I support the expressed goal of this legislation, which is to reduce potential public health risks that may result from the distribution of mislabled, subpotent, counterfeit or adulerated prescriptions drugs,'' the president said. But he said the portion requiring federal standards to be adhered to in licensing drug wholesalers `` represents a substantial intrusion into traditional state responsibilities and prerogatives.'' `` Accordingly, I have directed the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> to submit to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> legislation repealing this portion of the bill, and I urge the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact this legislation promptly,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

The building was owned by a partnership that included members of the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family, which indirectly pays the salary of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>. `` As chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee with oversight of these aspects of <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, I am asking <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> to provide a full report to this committee on this matter,'' <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said in a statement. The <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION>, the government's housekeeping agency, signed the lease on the building. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said his interest in the <ORGANIZATION> Chester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was piqued by recent news reports that the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership sold the building for a 60 percent profit about two weeks after signing the lease. The partnership made a profit of $ 22.6 million over two years. The <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the family's tax-exempt philanthropy, contributes the money that goes for Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s $ 40,000-a-year salary at the Multiple Sclerosis Society. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> says he had nothing to do with the lease, and that there is no connection between his wife's job and the building's lease. <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> officials have said there was nothing unusual about the lease. But <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said news reports concerning the building, where the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has offices, `` raised questions'' about <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION>'s actions. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he had not seen <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>'s letter, but the agency would comply with any requests from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Although the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> regularly approves prospective leases, the parallel <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel has declined to follow that procedure since the late 1970s, according to Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, R-Vt.

<HEAD>Interior Department Said To Have Understated Irrigation Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that irrigation subsidies in the West had been only about a quarter to half what its own experts and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget officers believed was correct, according to documents released by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairman Friday. The chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., said the documents indicate the department `` went to extraordinary lengths to lower the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- subsidy estimate'' and `` used a subsidy calculation it knew was inconsistent with the method in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s fiscal year 1989 budget. In February, the department told Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., that all past subsidies for the bureau's irrigation projects in the West amounted to $ 9.8 billion in today's dollars It said the subsidies currently were about $ 543 million a year, of which an estimated $ 203 million went to irrigate surplus crops receiving other aid in Agriculture Department programs. <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>'s documents indicated that bureau and department experts wanted to use figures of $ 19 billion to $ 24 billion for the total historical subsidy, $ 2.2 billion for the annual subsidy and $ 830 million for the subsidy for surplus crops. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is chairman of the water and power subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> is chairman of the oversight and investigations subcommittee. `` I find it incredible that an administration that professes to support cutting farm subsidies and the federal deficit would go to such extraordinary lengths to minimize its estimate of the subsidy received by a select group of western farmers,'' <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> wrote <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>. He asked that <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> supply new answers to <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s questions using calculations specified by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> _ answers he already has in the documents, which included drafts of the Feb. 24 reply to <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> from <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchant </PERSON>, principal deputy assistant secretary for water and science, that incorporated the <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> estimates. <PERSON> Marchant </PERSON> said Friday he did not know how he would reply to <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, but `` I am confident we are correct and this is an intellectually defensible analysis.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> provides many subsidies to irrigation projects, the most important of which are interest-free repayment of construction loans from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> or below-market interest rates. Over the decades, politicians from the West of all parties have jealously protected those subsidies. The difference in the subsidy estimates arises largely from disputes over what interest rates to use. The department used published historical long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> borrowing rates for 1906-1957, and after that a statutory `` small projects'' formula rate designed to reflect long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> borrowing costs. The department's experts argued that the formula blended historical and current rates in such a way that the real subsidy was underestimated. <PERSON> Marchant </PERSON> said in an interview that his boss, assistant secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>, `` is an investment banker and knows whereof he speaks.'' <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marchant </PERSON> said, argued successfully with <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> that many irrigation districts were the equivalent of municipal governments with their own taxing power `` and could have qualified to borrow at a tax-free rate,'' which would have been even lower than the federal rate. Not all the difference in subsidy estimates was the result of differing interest rates, <PERSON> Marchant </PERSON> said. Some $ 4.5 billion represents federal investment not yet repaid. `` That's crazy'' to include it, he maintained, since it will be repaid.

 Neither rain, nor sleet nor gloom of night kept a load of mail from reaching its destination, but a detour to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> certainly slowed it down. About 2,000 pieces of mail _ including Christmas gifts and well aged fruitcakes _ are scheduled to be delivered to this <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory on Monday, 2 -LCB- years after they were sent. <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> Postmaster <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he has ordered a crew to work overtime to immediately sort the mail and send it to the intended recipients. Why the delay? <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said a trailer containing the mail made a stopover in neighboring <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in November 1985. Inexplicably, it languished at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> dock.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Outline Plan To End Cambodian Conflict</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARI S. MANIAM</BYLINE>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on Friday offered a three-stage plan to end the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict and establish a `` peaceful, independent, neutral and non-aligned'' <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The visiting vice foreign minister of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tran </ORGANIZATION>, outlined the plan at a news conference in <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION> before continuing his Asian tour. `` In case there is no solution to the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> problem -LRB- through this plan -RRB- by 1990, then we -LRB- <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> -RRB- will solve the problem unilaterally and we will withdraw our troops unilaterally,'' <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> maintains about 140,000 troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> said the first move under the proposal would be holding informal talks, as proposed earlier by <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and backed in principle by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, comprised of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>. He said these discussions would be in two stages. First would be talks among the <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> regime in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, which was installed by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> after it invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978, and the three factions of the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kampuchea </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> -RRB-. Coalition guerrillas are fighting <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and the Vietnamese from inside <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, like neighboring <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, is communist, but the government <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> installed there is pro-Vietnam and pro-Soviet while the ousted regime was pro-China. The three-party coalition is headed by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, former head of state of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and is made up of <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> loyalists; the pro-Peking <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which killed millions of Cambodians before being ousted by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> Cambodian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Son </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sann </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON> now leads the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is up to these Cambodians to work out what sort of peace they want ... but it should not be something which will see a resurgence of a genocidal regime,'' <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> said. He added, `` It should be a peaceful, independent, neutral and non-aligned <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' The second stage would be for the Cambodians and concerned countries like <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> to join in further informal discussions, <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> said. These two stages of talks could be held in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, since that country also has offered to act as host, said <PERSON> Tran </PERSON>. He said the third stage would be a formal, international conference, to work out such issues as guaranteeing peace in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and supervising a transitional phase. The Vietnamese official said this conference could be held in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. He noted that <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>; Hun Sen; Vietnamese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> and others have said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> could play a role in helping bring peace to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> might also assist in supervising the accord. <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> on Monday and spoke at the news conference before leaving for <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> en route to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.

 Speedy's daily regimen sounds like average stuff for your athletic beach bum: a run in the sand, a 30-minute swim and a plentiful diet. But Speedy is a crab, and he's preparing for a 2.5-meter race that will kick off this coastal community's tourist season. The race is <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>'s answer to the popular slug races in <LOCATION> Elma </LOCATION>, 35 miles to the east. `` I've had my crab in training for almost three weeks,'' said Speedy's owner, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigler </PERSON>, office manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Westport-Grayland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and an organizer of the event. `` Every morning I take him out to <LOCATION> Westhaven </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and exercise Speedy in the sand,'' he said. `` It builds muscle tone. Then I bring him back and make sure he eats real well.'' Participants can enter their own crab in the race or use one provided by the organizers. The event also includes a crab feed _ runners not included.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Friday they had no confirmation that the hijackers of the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwaiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet had left <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, despite published reports they had flown to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` There are conflicting reports about the whereabouts of the hijackers, but we have no indication they have left <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Report Hits S&amp;L Property Agency; Chairman's Resignation Announced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The publication Friday of a highly critical congressional report on a federal agency created to manage and sell property from insolvent savings institutions was followed by an announcement that the agency's chairman had resigned last month. The report, by the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, charged that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has become a `` bloated bureacracy'' that wastes millions of dollars of public money. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, in an written statement accompanying the report, said <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> should be phased out as soon as possible and its duties reassumed by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which backs deposits in federally insured S & amp; Ls. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> report was dated March 17, but it was not made public until Friday, when it was published in the Congressional Record. In a letter dated March 31, but not released by <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> until Friday, the agency's chairman, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON> submitted his resignation, effective immediately. <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> attorney, wrote that his resignation `` is intended to open the way'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates 3,147 federal thrift institutions, to pick his replacement and `` achieve maximum capability with <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>'s new executive command and chartered course.'' He has been replaced, on an acting basis, by Vice Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zellars </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON> was previously chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group that advises federal regulators. His law firm represents some of the largest S & amp; Ls in the industry and the creation of <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> was his idea. The stated purpose of <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> is bring money into the S & amp; L insurance fund, at a time when it is short of funds to resolve the problems of soaring insolvencies, particularly in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other states hard hit by depressed oil prices. However, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> report said `` the unspoken agenda was to give the savings and loan industry, more specifically a small but very powerful subgroup of the industry, a major say in how the thrift industry's problems would be resolved.'' The report said it was `` difficult to determine'' how much money <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> has wasted, but it said has directly charged $ 20 million to receiverships set up to liquidate failed S & amp; Ls and it has passed on $ 51 million in subcontractor costs. Despite this income, <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> is more than $ 15 million in the red, the report said. Money spent by the receiverships is deducted from what is eventually left for the creditors of failed institutions, including depositors over the insurance limit of $ 100,000. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, who took over as <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> chief executive in February, said he is working to remedy the agency's faults. `` We know there have been problems with <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> and that's why they brought me aboard,'' he said. `` I have not read the report, but when I do read it, problems that are real and exist, we're going to fix.'' <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> said he hoped within six months to resolve `` long-range and strategic'' questions, such as whether <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> should be merged with the insurance fund, be completely privatized or continue under its present structure. He said he has reduced the <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> payroll from 388 to 370 employees, saving $ 1 million a year and is consolidating <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> office space for a reduction of 16,000 square feet. He predicted <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> would be in the black for the first quarter of the year. `` I think we're starting to bring it under control,'' <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> said. However, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> report described reform efforts so far as `` cosmetic'' and as public relations `` intended to defuse criticism.'' Among the other findings of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> report: _ <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> employees awarded contracts, without bidding, to former business associates _ `` <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> officials lived first class and received excessive salaries and bonuses.'' It said its top 32 executives were paid over $ 3 million in 1987 and its total payroll of $ 22 million went to more 380 employees. _ From its creation in late 1985 to the end of last year, it managed to sell only $ 124 million of the property in its care _ `` Certain <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> employees continue to maintain financial interests in firms that could benefit from <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> contracts.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulwider </PERSON>, a spokesman for the bank board, said the information in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> report is dated. He said <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> is reducing its expenses and is cooperating more fully with <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, the largest trade group in the industry, said league officials would have no immediate comment.

 <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, which has been criticized for rejecting boat people, will expand a refugee center in order to accommodate up to 10,000 arrivals, officials said Friday. But to prevent a flood of escapees from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, those housed at the center will not be eligible for resettlement in third countries, the officials said. `` The door has been somewhat opened,'' said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity. However, he said <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s recent policy of turning back Vietnamese boat people could be reinstated and that in some cases it was still being carried out <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> was criticized by some international aid agencies and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government for pushing Vietnamese boats back out to sea. Some reports have claimed that 100 to 170 refugees may have drowned after their boats were turned away from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> early this year. Thai officials, speaking at a background briefing, said <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> adopted tough measures because Western governments were not living up to their agreement to accept the refugees. They also said there was no end in sight to the flow of immigrants and the new arrivals were `` economic migrants'' rather than people fleeing persecution. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the tough stance had been modified because of `` hopeful signs,'' including a greater movement of refugees from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a growing realization by the international community that Indochinese refugees had to be resettled. They indicated that <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> was also unhappy about the adverse publicty surrounding the rejection of the boat people. The officials said an annex was being constructed at Site 2, a camp along the border with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, to house 8,000 to 10,000 Vietnamese. The camp, to be administered by the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> military, already holds more than 900 Vietnamese boat people and 4,000 who fled <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> by land and crossed <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. About 2,600 Vietnamese now along the Thai coast will be moved to the Site 2 annex. Another 15,000 Vietnamese are being housed at <ORGANIZATION> Phanat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nikhom </ORGANIZATION>, a transit center for Indochinese refugees, including Cambodians and Laotians. This center is to be closed to new Vietnamese arrivals and pressure will be exerted on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries to accept those currently there, the officials said. `` Thirteen years after the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war we have gone beyond a certain threshold,'' one official said. `` Those now coming are not the traditional boat people. Most are looking for better economic opportunities.'' The Thai government ordered the Vietnamese boats turned away when the numbers of refugees jumped dramatically at the end of last year and rose to 2,500 in January 1988 alone. Many arrived via <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> with the aid of smugglers. The officials said reports of deaths had been exaggerated. They said less than 100 Vietnamese perished and fewer than 20 bodies had been recovered in Thai waters. `` It was never the willful or malicious intent of the royal Thai government to cause harm or injury to Vietnamese asylum-seekers,'' the background paper said. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has since 1975 provided temporary refuge for over 1 million Indochinese refugees. The Vietnamese are regarded as illegal immigrants, but a large number have in the past been allowed by local authorities to land without problems. The officials indicated the law would remain ambiguous although there had been a recent `` softening'' of Thai attitude. The background paper said those who would not be allowed to land on <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> shores would be given food, water and fuel and their boats would be repaired if necessary. `` A major influx could unravel these new arrangements,'' one official said. He noted that since January, the number of arrivals had dropped dramatically, but he did not provide a number.

 Outraged <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> officials suspended <ORGANIZATION> Pi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> fraternity Friday after a grand jury said an intoxicated, 18-year-old woman student was raped at the fraternity house and the group's members refused to cooperate with the investigation. The young woman was found March 5 with `` crude words'' and a fraternity symbol written on her thigh, a <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury said Thursday in an interim report. She had been raped by more than one person, her clothing was in disarray, she had suffered multiple scratches and abrasions, and she was so drunk that her life was in danger, the report said. `` We informed <LOCATION> Pi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kappa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> they are suspended immediately pending a formal hearing which will begin next Wednesday,'' Dean of Students <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said Friday. `` They are no longer a registered student organization at <ORGANIZATION> FSU </ORGANIZATION>. They lose all rights and privileges.''' The incident marked the second time in a week the fraternity was suspended on a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> campus. The Pi Kappa Alpha chapter at <ORGANIZATION> Stetson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> was suspended April 15 in the wake of reports of a similar incident. <PERSON> Stetson </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> of Student Affairs <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> has said a young woman reported she was sexually assaulted by more than one man during a fraternity party April 9. He also said he heard reports that other people watched the alleged assault. The executive vice president of the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based national fraternity, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Orians </PERSON>, said there were roughly 130 fraternity members at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and 70 at <LOCATION> Stetson </LOCATION>. Investigators for the national organization visted both campuses this week, he said. `` We're looking at this -LRB- <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> incident -RRB-, at this point, as an individual incident involving an individual member that had nothing to do with the chapter,'' he said. `` In the Stetson case, we do know there was some violations of school rules, separate and apart from any sexual allegations,'' said Orians. <PERSON> Stetson </PERSON> is a Baptist university. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> officials were sickened over police information and the grand jury's interim report on the incident there. No individuals have been charged, but the investigation was continuing. `` When you have 25,000 students, you have disciplinary problems, but a situation like this has n't happened in my nine years here,'' said <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>. The president of the fraternity, <PERSON> Brant </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bellair </LOCATION>, told the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flambeau </LOCATION>, a student newspaper, that he was advised not to talk in public about the incident. `` My comment is that I'm very involved with final exams and exam week and my attorney told me not to concentrate on the grand jury but to concentrate on final exams,'' the Flambeau reported Friday. The panel's report criticized the fraternity for not cooperating and urged witnesses to step forward. `` Possible witnesses have a civic and moral duty to come forward and report what they have seen or what they have heard from or about the perpetrators of this sordid incident,'' the grand jury stated. The 18-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student was found raped and `` intoxicated to a life-threatening degree'' early on March 5, the grand jury said. The victim was found on the floor of the Theta <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> fraternity house, about a block from the Pi <LOCATION> Kappa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> house, at about 5:30 a.m. and taken to a hospital for treatment and an examination. The grand jury said members of <ORGANIZATION> Theta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chi </ORGANIZATION> and of <LOCATION> Sigma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> fraternity, where the victim said she had visited earlier, were cooperative. Campus police determined members of those two organizations were not involved and knew nothing about the victim or the crime. By contrast, <PERSON> Pi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kappa </PERSON> <PERSON> Alpha </PERSON> fraternity members were uncooperative and evasive, the grand jury said. The victim told authorities she had met a Pi Kappa Alpha member at a club, where she had been drinking beer and tequila. She said he took her to his fraternity house, giving her a bottle of wine, which she consumed. `` She alleges her host then sexually assaulted her, and she passed out from intoxication,'' wrote the grand jury. A medical examination revealed that the victim had a 0.349 blood-alcohol level, more than three times the legal limit for driving, and had been raped by more than one person, according to the grand jury report. `` She was comatose,'' said police Lt. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Handley </PERSON>, adding that sexual intercourse had occurred during the time she was unconscious. `` She was in a life-threatening situation.'' <PERSON> Handley </PERSON> declined to give details on the words or the symbol written on the woman's thigh, except to say it was a fraternity symbol but not the symbol of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. The woman was released from the hospital March 6. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said she has been receiving counseling. The drinking age in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is 21. Meanwhile, fraternity and sorority pledging was suspended on the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> on Friday after a student was electrocuted when he waded into a pond during an apparent fraternity stunt. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 20, a sophomore from <LOCATION> Mahopac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, died after he walked into the pond wearing only his underwear around 6:15 p.m. Thursday. <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenburg </PERSON> said the death appeared accidental and the incident appeared to be a non-violent hazing. Two other students were injured by the electric current in the concrete-lined pond. The reason the pond had current running through it was not immediately determined. The current disappeared when switches to electrical circuits near the pond were turned off Thursday night, officials said.

 A mother who allegedly drowned her 2-month-old son in a bathtub to stop his crying was ordered held on $ 75,000 bail Friday on a second-degree murder charge and barred from unsupervised visits with her other son. <PERSON> Lucretia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, 36, who appeared before <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>, called police Wednesday to report her infant son, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>, had been kidnapped. She broke down Thursday during a polygraph test at <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, telling detectives about her son's death and directing them to a trash can near her home where the body was found, authorities said. Child abuse experts said Friday that Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> appeared to be a victim of postpartum depression, probably seeing no other way out. `` What's mind-boggling to me is the friends, family and neighbors of this woman did n't see what was happening to this mother,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON>, chairman of Mayor's <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Child Abuse and Neglect. `` Postpartum depression is a disease,'' <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON> said. `` It can make a loving, caring mother feel like killing herself and her baby.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, a full-time homemaker, was alone when the baby died. Her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, was at work and the couple's 7-year-old son, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, was at school. `` He was colicky and she had postpartum depression. She had a difficult pregnancy, a difficult birth, the kid was up all night and she could n't sleep. She just snapped,'' a police source said of the case. Postpartum depression can cause irritability, exhaustion, insomnia and confusion about child care. <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON> estimated it strikes 70 percent of mothers in one form or another. `` With the disappearance of the extended family, the usual support systems _ a maiden aunt, widowed sister, other relatives _ are gone,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> New </PERSON>, chairwoman of the pediatric department at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital-Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DePaola </PERSON>, said his client `` had been on an emotional roller coaster'' since 1984. She had had an accidental sterilization by a doctor, followed by a subsequent operation to correct that condition and a very difficult Caesarean section birth, he said. <PERSON> DePaola </PERSON> refused to comment on his defense strategy after Friday's hearing. In a <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> case three months ago, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Remington </PERSON>, 29, was acquitted by reason of insanity in the shooting death of her 6-week-old son after her lawyers argued she suffered from severe postpartum depression. In a 1985 case in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, 28-year-old <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Comitz </PERSON> pleaded guilty but mentally ill to third-degree murder after throwing her month-old son into a freezing mountain stream. She is serving an eight-to-20 year sentence in the death.

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> asked the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration Friday to resume negotiations next month on `` national security'' matters of mutual concern. He suggested the meetings begin May 15 at <LOCATION> Manzanillo </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s west coast, site of several rounds in 1984 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suspended the negotiations in January 1985. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also claimed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to give non-lethal aid to Nicaraguan rebels in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> violated agreements between the rebels, known as Contras, and his leftist Sandinista government. He said the move encouraged military hardliners in the <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leadership. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, he accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of concealing weapons and ammunition in shipments of humanitarian aid to rebels in Honduran camps. On the matter of U.S.-Nicaraguan negotiations, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said it was time President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> fulfilled a promise of talks he made last year. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> in November that Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was prepared to meet the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION> as part of discussions with other Central American countries `` once serious negotiations'' on a Nicaraguan cease-fire were under way. `` We have met with the Contras, there is a cease-fire, there is an agreement and the time has come for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to show consistency by meeting with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to discuss matters of national security,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. He said the Nicaraguan proposal for talks would be delivered by <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunnerman </PERSON>, ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who was called home Thursday for consultations. Tunnerman and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Escoto </PERSON> attended the news conference. `` We are offering to discuss topics of security,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has singled out <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as a security threat and we are willing to discuss that and we also want to be heard about how <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has lived under a state of aggression by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He urged <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to lift its economic embargo on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, declaring: `` Favorable conditions exist for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to act constructively, but ... the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's attitude continues to be negative.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he discussed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid to Contras in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> with that country's president, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON>, who said he was informed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that the rebels `` were dying of hunger.'' An agreement between the Contra leadership and Nicaraguan government allows humanitarian aid to be distributed through neutral international organizations when the rebels are settled in designated cease-fire zones in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The Nicaraguan leader said he told <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> the Contras in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> should be considered `` refugees, disarmed and relocated away from the Nicaraguan border,'' or enter <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and join other rebels in the areas assigned. An agreement between the Nicaraguan government and Contra leaders provides for rebels to assemble in seven designated areas during the first two weeks of May. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said non-lethal aid, most of it food, was being flown from <LOCATION> Toncontin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, the Honduran capital, to camps controlled by Contra commanders who oppose the cease-fire. He said he told <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> `` the advisable thing would be to tell AID -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to wait until the negotiations between the Nicaraguan Resistance -LRB- Contras -RRB- and the government agree on the way the rebels enter the assigned areas or become refugees -LRB- in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' An AID official said Thursday the first truckloads of food arrived at rebel camps inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> this week. He said the shipments were sent from <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> after being inspected by independent observers to make sure they did not contain arms. Contra and government leaders signed an agreement March 23 to end the civil war, which the government says has cost more than 26,000 lives since 1981. A 60-day cease-fire began April 1.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> officials said they would welcome an end to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> arms shipments to the Kremlin-backed regime in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> but reacted cautiously to statements along that line by a senior aide to <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` will continue to supply the resistance as long as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> continues supplying arms to the -LRB- <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> -RRB- regime.'' `` We have also made clear that we would prefer a complete cessation of military aid by both'' the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, who are acting as guarantors of an agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on the withdrawal of an estimated 120,000 Soviet troops form <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, she said. <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>, who has advised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on the Afghan war, was quoted in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Friday as saying the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was not planning to continue shipping arms to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. `` We do n't need to supply,'' said <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>. `` We are n't going to supply if the Americans are n't going to supply. But we are n't going to restrict our relations with the Afghan government'' headed by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> ally, <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>. <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>'s remarks appeared to break sharply with a position the Soviets have held since January. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> refused an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> proposal to end aid simultaneously, a formula known in diplomatic jargon as negative symmetry, and insisted instead continuing aid, described as positive symmetry. Moreover, Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> said Tuesday that Soviet aircraft were flying night missions into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, shipping tons of arms from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Asked to assess <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>'s remarks, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said `` it is not clear what time frame he is addressing. If Mr. <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON> is indicating an authoritative Soviet position on restraint during withdrawal, which we have proposed, we welcome it.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has accelerated the flow of aid to the mujahedeen guerrillas across the Pakistani border, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has stepped up its shipments of arms to the <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> regime, according to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON> made his remarks to a group of Americans visiting <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, a trip that Pakistani and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said appeared designed to give `` respectability'' to the <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> regime. One Pakistani diplomat said <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>'s remarks might be designed to put pressure on <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to stop <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms from moving through its territory. `` We have to take <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>'s statement carefully,'' said the Pakistani diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. Officials of the Afghan regime `` are trying to gain some respectability with this group of influential Americans,'' said the official. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source said that <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>'s comments appeared to be part of a campaign to pressure <LOCATION> Paskistan </LOCATION>, but predicted it would not work. `` I think that the Soviets will be making statements like this from time to time,'' said the source, who spoke on condition that he not be further identified. `` If the intent is to pressure <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, then I do n't think it will achieve that result. I think it will stiffen the Pakistani resolve,'' said the source.

<HEAD>Britain Orders Ships to Stop Visits to Denmark</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ordered its warships Friday to steer clear of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, whose toughened ban on nuclear weapons has brought criticism from the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that it has suspended <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship visits to <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> until after a general election there scheduled for May 10. Last week, Danish socialists forced a resolution through the country's Parliament requiring the government to tell visiting ships that nuclear arms are barred from Danish ports in peacetime. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> refuses to say whether its ships carry nuclear arms. A brief <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> announcement said that `` in view of the Danish general election, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Danish </LOCATION> governments have agreed it would be appropriate to postpone a number of British navy visits which had been scheduled in the coming week.'' It was the first such boycott by a member of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. British sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the policy of refusing to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons is `` an absolute matter of principle _ there is no exception.'' Danish Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>, whose center-right coalition is opposed to the nuclear weapons resolution, called a new election rather than impose the measure. <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, like <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> member <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, has for 30 years officially banned nuclear weapons from its ports in peacetime. But both countries avoided controversy over the issue by not asking whether visiting ships carried nuclear weapons. The new Danish resolution underlined the dilemma posed by a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> member opposed to nuclear weapons, which are considered fundamental to the defense strategy of the 16-nation alliance. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other several other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries have stopped naval visits to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, a non-NATO member which bans nuclear weapons on its territory. Danish newspapers reported Friday that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> sent a strong letter to Foreign Minister <PERSON> Uff </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellemann-Jensen </PERSON> protesting the resolution. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s closest <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ally. The two nations share a concern over the defense of the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and its narrow approaches, which are under Danish control. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General Lord <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> also have publicly criticized the resolution. The British decision meant canceling visits by six ships, including a destroyer, <ORGANIZATION> HMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bristol </ORGANIZATION>, and a frigate, HMS Euryalus, officials said. The other ships involved are three minesweepers and a survey vessel.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> assured a visiting delegation from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> on Friday that he will intensify pressure on the Soviets to bring about a settlement in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> said. In an interview with wire service reporters, the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> official said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vowed during a brief meeting at the White House that he would raise the <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> issue when he goes to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> at the end of May for a summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The situation in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> always has been on the U.S.-Soviet agenda of regional issues, but <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials have complained that at earlier summits the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was n't forceful enough in pressing the Soviets to use their influence with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to pull out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> decision to withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after eight years raises hopes that the Cambodian situation will emerge as the top item on the U.S.-Soviet agenda on regional hot spots. The occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which receives armaments and vast economic aid from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, has been blamed for unrest and violence along the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border and for causing hundreds of thousands of people to flee into <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON>, the Soviet deputy foreign minister for <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs, told officials in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> earlier this week that his nation's influence with the Vietnamese is limited. <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> said, however, `` if the Soviets are willing to do it,'' they can pressure <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to withdraw. `` I think the Soviets are eager to have some political solution to the Cambodian problem,'' <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> denounced a proposal by Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> open a diplomatic interest section in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to coordinate U.S.-Vietnamese efforts to find the estimated 1,700 American servicemen still listed as missing in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> after the Vietnam War. At a time when Southeast Asian and Western nations are pressing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to pull out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the opening of such a diplomatic office `` would send the wrong signal,'' the foreign minister said. <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> said he exchanged assurances with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and with Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> that both nations would continue to play their appointed roles in the ongoing <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> refugee crisis. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> reluctantly has agreed to continue as the country of `` first-asylum'' for the refugees as long as other countries like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> promise to resettle them. Since 1975, more than 675,000 refugees have fled <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and many of them still remain in camps in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> refugee workers, backed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, have complained in recent months that refugees fleeing in boats have been pushed back to sea by <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> authorities. <LOCATION> Savetsila </LOCATION> repeated Thai assertions that `` smugglers,'' not <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials, were responsible for harming the refugees. Given what he termed `` refugee fatigue'' _ the growing disinclination by the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> people to care for the influx of refugees _ `` it would be counterproductive'' for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to berate his country about its refugee policies, <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for ratification a treaty with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> covering mutual assistance in criminal matters, which was signed in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on March 19, 1986. The treaty is one of a series being negotiated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to assist in prosecution of members of drug cartels, white collar criminals and terrorists. It provides for cooperation in such things as the taking of testimony, serving documents and executing requests for searches and seizures.

<HEAD>Robeson Jail Employees Partly To Blame For Death, Report Says</HEAD>

 State officials say a black <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail inmate probably would still be alive if jail workers had called an ambulance more quickly after he fell ill, but the sheriff of the racially divided county accused investigators of slipshod work. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> McKellar </PERSON> died Jan. 12 after an asthma attack in the jail, and his death and the tensions it created was cited as a factor in the takeover of the Robesonian newspaper office for several hours the following month. `` The response time was initially slow after the jailer was notified of the problem _ and was inexcusably slow after he verified the situation later,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, chairman of a special task force appointed by Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> to study the <PERSON> McKellar </PERSON> case. The task force was formed after the newspaper takeover, which ended peacefully. Tuscarora Indians <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> are accused of taking hostages at the Robesonian and demanding an investigation into the death of <PERSON> McKellar </PERSON> and other alleged corruption among law enforcement officials in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Since then, the predominantly <LOCATION> rural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>, whose population is almost evenly divided among whites, blacks and Indians, has also been rocked by the shooting death of an Indian activist who was running for judge. Authorities later blamed the death on a romantic dispute, not political differences. The state report released by <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> says that jailers failed to respond properly to <PERSON> McKellar </PERSON>'s asthma attack Jan. 12, but <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said the negligence was not criminal. `` There was neglect, but we could n't find any reason to suggest that it was intentional,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Winston-Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. `` We did n't see any criminal intent _ just neglect of duty.'' The report further concludes that a staffing shortage, a broken alarm system and <PERSON> McKellar </PERSON>'s periodic refusal to take his medication all contributed to his death. Sheriff <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> condemned the report. `` There are enough generalities and loose ends in the narrative to make your report seem more an allegation than an investigation,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> wrote in a formal response. `` I think that's just political rhetoric _ just defensive talk,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. `` We're not out to get Stone. If we had been, we would n't have asked for his comments.'' <PERSON> McKellar </PERSON> became sick near dinner time, according to the report, and several inmates began calling the jailer for help. The jailer, who was doing two jobs at once because the jail was short-staffed that evening, did n't come until 6:43 p.m., when he passed through the cell block on his regular rounds. At that time the jailer gave <PERSON> McKellar </PERSON> a pill. But <PERSON> McKellar </PERSON>'s condition did n't improve, prompting the inmates to renew their calls for help, the report said The jailer called an ambulance for <PERSON> McKellar </PERSON> at 8:41 p.m. The vehicle arrived three minutes later, just as <PERSON> McKellar </PERSON> slumped over without breath or pulse, the report says. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Butts </PERSON>, the state's chief medical examiner who assisted the task force in investigating the death, said an ambulance should have been called earlier. Even calling an ambulance roughly 20 minutes earlier would probably have saved the inmate, he said. Meanwhile, a lawyer for accused hostage-taker <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said Friday that his car was shot at in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> as he drove to interview a witness, but he refused to report the incident to local authorities. `` This was a sniper-type thing,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>. `` I was shot at. ... But we are not going to be intimidated.'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said the incident occurred at about 2:40 p.m. Wednesday in <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION>. He did not report the incident officially for almost 24 hours, when he filled out a report at the police department in <LOCATION> Carrboro </LOCATION>, where his office is based, about 100 miles from the scene of the incident. `` I was n't about to go to the people in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said. `` I'm investigating them. We asked the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to come in, but they refused because they said it was a local matter.'' `` The Constitution is not in effect in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` That's why we have to go to these ridiculous extremes.'' The <LOCATION> Carrboro </LOCATION> police report said an unspecified `` projectile'' hit the windshield of <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>'s car and that ballistics tests would be needed to determine whether it was a bullet.

 The new owners of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> asked a federal court Friday to rule they have no collective bargaining agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> and to deny the union's demand for arbitration. New <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here, claiming their obligation to abide by an expired bargaining agreement ended Nov. 1, 1987, after 92 bargaining sessions over a seven-month period. The union filed its demand for arbitration with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arbitration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 27, 1988, citing an `` evergreen'' provision of the bargaining agreement that allows the pact to continue during negotiations. `` The issue is whether the evergreen clause is in effect only during fruitful negotiations,'' said <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Geduldig </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The last negotiations were not fruitful.'' Negotiations were last held in March, but both union and <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen characterized them as unsuccessful and non-productive. `` It appears that the company is not interested in seeking a constructive relationship with the union,'' said <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormally </PERSON>, an editor on <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> desk who is also the union's chairman of negotiations. `` Everyone agrees _ including management _ that a strike would be lethal to the company,'' <PERSON> McCormally </PERSON> said. `` We are interested in seeing the company survive. Why management is interested in brutalizing the company, I do n't know.'' <PERSON> Geduldig </PERSON> said that the company is unwilling to bargain with union officials. `` There are no negotiations scheduled at this time and it is difficult to say that there will be future arbitration,'' <PERSON> Geduldig </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Palme Murder Commission Recommends Anti-Terrorist Unit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A special commission on Friday criticized the investigation into the 1986 assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> and recommended the creation of a part-time police unit to combat terrorism. The commission, headed by a former district governor and including a former prime minister, also proposed stripping courts of the power to deport suspected terrorists and giving that authority to the government. Parliament appointed the seven-member panel 13 months ago. Commission members told a news conference they still had no clue to the identity of <LOCATION> Palme </LOCATION>'s killer or his motive. The commission was named to review earlier inquiries into the assassination of <LOCATION> Palme </LOCATION>, who was shot to death as he and his wife strolled along a <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> street on Feb. 28, 1986. It also was told to recommend crime-fighting procedures. Reports from the earlier investigations said police responded slowly to the killing and criticized procedures in organizing the search for the gunman. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, where violent crimes and political violence are rare, has resisted forming an anti-terrorist squad with opponents saying such a force could introduce a `` brutalizing'' element into police work. To counter such a possibility, the special commission suggested a 50-member elite unit, with officers assigned to regular police duties two-thirds of the time and anti-terrorist work the remaining third. It would be up to the government to convene the force for possible action, and the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> would have a special security adviser. Commission chairman <PERSON> Ragnar </PERSON> <PERSON> Edenman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> police chief who headed the assassination investigation for the first year, `` abused his power'' by focusing on a Kurdish exile group and ignoring the advice of civilian prosecutors. In <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, prosecutors conduct criminal investigations in conjunction with police and advise officers on evidence needed for convictions. <PERSON> Edenman </PERSON> said prosectors should take a stronger role and police `` should be the instruments of the prosecutors.'' Panel members included <PERSON> Thorbjorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Falldin </PERSON>, a conservative politician who was prime minister between two socialist administrations headed by <LOCATION> Palme </LOCATION> and representatives of other political parties in Parliament. The commission dismissed proposals that bodyguards be mandatory for all Cabinet ministers. `` It is ... out of the question to force these persons by law to have a bodyguard,'' the report said. Palme had given his bodyguards the evening off on the night when he was killed. He was shot in the back as he was walking home with his wife <PERSON> Lisbet </PERSON> after attending a movie.

<HEAD>USDA Issues New Rules To Prevent Trauma To Show Horses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New interim rules have been adopted which will gradually put into effect federal restrictions on the height of hoof pads used on Tennessee Walking Horses and other show horses to give them distinctive gaits, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The new rules will take effect on Monday, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON>, acting administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. From April 25 through July 31, pads may be no more than three inches high; from Aug. 1 through Oct. 31, two inches; and, effective Nov. 1, no more than one-half inch high covering the sole of the foot. At that time, however, an additional half-inch-high `` rim'' pad will be allowed between the full pad and the shoe. All pads must be made of leather or other similar soft, pliable material. <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said the new rules prohibit chains or rollers that weigh more than six ounces, including the weight of the fastener. Weights on the hoof other than the specified pads are also prohibited, except for horseshoes weighing up to 16 ounces. <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said the reason the restrictions on pad height are being phased-in is to prevent trauma to show horses, many of which currently have pads that are four inches high. `` To remove four-inch pads abruptly could cause stress on a horse's feet and limbs,'' he said. The new rules allow gradual reductions to reach a pad height that could not reasonably be expected to causing soring, <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said. Agency officials will continue to monitor horse shows and work with the industry to prevent soring, he said. `` If we find sored horses, we will take action against the responsible parties, regardless of the devices used,'' <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said. The Horse Protection Act was passed in 1970 to eliminate the practice of `` soring'' to produce special gaits in horses. `` Soring is the use of cruel methods, devices or chemical substances on a horse's legs or feet that can reasonably be expected to cause a horse to experience pain when walking,'' the agency said in its statement. `` Soring is done primarily to alter a horse's gait in the show ring.'' The new interim rules apply to all breeds of horses at shows or sales, the agency said. On March 21, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here, in a lawsuit brought against <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, invalidated certain sections of the department's horse protection regulations. In the court order and a clarifying order issued April 13, the court directed <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to initiate rulemaking to eliminate devices that could reasonably be expected to cause soring, the agency said. The court specifically referred to pads and chains used on the front feet and legs of horses to alter their gaits. Before the court order, there was no limit on the height of pads in <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s regulations, except for those on yearling horses, although the industry had its own rule limiting pads to four inches. The previous <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> regulations also put a 16-ounce weight limit on horseshoes for yearlings, but had no weight limit on shoes for older horses. The weight limit on chains was eight ounces for two-year-olds and 10 ounces for horses three years or older.

 Two small pyramids built for the wives of <PERSON> Pharoah </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepi </PERSON> I were discovered under mounds of sand by French scientists who say the find could shed light on a dynasty that ruled <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> more than 2,000 years before <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was born. The discovery was announced Friday by members of the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Sakkara </LOCATION> and scientists from <LOCATION> Electricite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the state-owned utility which conducted a high-tech exploration at the site about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Sakkara </LOCATION> site contains the step pyramid built by <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoser </PERSON>, said to be the first stone structure in history, and other pyramids. The discovery of the queens' tombs brings to 85 the number of known pyramids in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. One pyramid is in ruins, but the second could contain subterranean funeral chambers decorated with hieroglyphics, said <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Montlucon </PERSON>, who led the utility's team. In the 19th century, the 50-acre <LOCATION> Sakkara </LOCATION> site served as a quarry from which stone was taken for building in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. For the last 25 years or so, extensive digging around the pyramid of <PERSON> Pepi </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> has left a field of rubble at the site. `` It looks like a battlefield there,'' said <PERSON> Montlucon </PERSON>, adding that the pyramids were covered by `` eight meters -LRB- about 26 -LCB- feet -RRB- of rubbish.'' `` In such disturbed land, it would be practically impossible to find anything, to know where to begin to dig, without our current technology,'' he said. Last summer Montlucon supervised the conservation of artifacts retrieved from the wreck of the Titanic. He said the electromagnetic tests used at <LOCATION> Sakkara </LOCATION> were developed by the French utility for conducting geophysical tests at potential nuclear reactor sites. Using test results, the team put together a map pinpointing five possible pyramid sites. Three sites were then excavated. The first hole revealed a highly decorated mastaba, or tomb, of a dynastic official. Weeks passed before workers finally hit the stone of a pyramid on Feb. 12. `` I was in the big pyramid when the foreman came running in shouting ` Mabrouk!' -LRB- congratulations -RRB-,'' Montlucon said. `` I felt so happy I could have cried.'' Workers dug out a `` buttonhole'' through which they could see a segment of the pyramid wall, smooth and gold in color. The French archaeological team will ask permission from the <ORGANIZATION> Eygptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to begin full excavation next year on the pyramid, thought to be 66 feet tall and 66 feet at the base. The find is `` a big gain for Egyptology'' and `` will allow us to know more, possibly a great deal more, about the 6th Dynasty'' that ruled the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> from 2420 to 2258 B.C., <PERSON> Montlucon </PERSON> said. Archaeologists are hoping the pyramid contains hieroglyphic inscriptions that can be added to the Pyramid Texts, the oldest writings known to man. The archaeologists also hope the writing will reveal the name of the pharaoh's wife, shrouded by the centuries, who is buried there.

<HEAD>Mulroney Urges Congress To Curb Acid Rain If Reagan Won't</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should act on its own to clean up acid rain since the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has refused to do so, Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said Friday. In an interview with American reporters before an official visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next week, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be pretty upset with me if I were dumping my garbage in your backyard. Well, this is what's happening except it's coming from above.'' <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> claims that 50 percent of the acid rain damaging its waterways and forests comes from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> smokestacks across the border. For more than seven years, it has urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to legislate reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, on advice from the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, says more research is needed before embarking on costly clean-up measures. `` I do n't accept his view at all,'' said <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, who has built otherwise close relations with his fellow conservative. `` When lakes and rivers and streams and forests are dying before your eyes, you do n't need a great deal of further research.'' In Parliament Friday, opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of believing acid rain is caused by `` ducks, birds and trees'' and demanded that <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> present the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with a multimillion-dollar bill for damage to Canadian forests and lakes. But <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, interviewed in his office, said he favored the civil approach. All nations have differences, he said. `` Do you declare a war?'' He said he had not given up on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but will use an invitation to address both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> next Wednesday to urge American legislators to act on their own. `` I'll accept an acid rain treaty irrespective of which end of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue initiates action,'' the prime minister said. He said many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> support the fight against acid rain, and he forecast that all three leading contenders for the presidency, Republican Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrats <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, would be strong advocates for the environment. But he added: `` I'm not pinning my hopes on any individual.'' <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> reports 14,000 lifeless lakes and 19 barren salmon rivers because of acid rain. It began its own cleanup in 1985, aimed at reducing its sulfur emissions 50 percent by 1994. It wants the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to do the same. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said there will be a treaty eventually on cutting down on cross-border acid rain, `` that is for certain. The only question is when. It wo n't be tomorrow, but it's going to come _ sooner rather than later.'' He said Americans should care that they are ruining the northeastern part of the continent and damaging relations with their `` best friend, neighbor and ally, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.'' Despite press speculation that he will call an election this fall, a year before his five-year term expires, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said: `` I'm not even thinking about an election.'' The 49-year-old leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said his government has a full legislative program this year, including ratification of the Free Trade Agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a constitutional accord recognizing <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> as a `` distinct society,'' a day care program and the privatization of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've got a hell of a lot of business to do before I'm going to start considering elections,'' he said. He forecast victory when he does call an election. The latest polls indicate the three Canadian parties neck-and-neck and the Conservatives on the rise.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will continue to send aid to the impoverished island of <LOCATION> Negros </LOCATION> despite threats by communist rebels to attack projects funded by the countries, embassy officials said Friday. The army's chief of staff, meanwhile, ordered troops to hunt down the <LOCATION> Negros </LOCATION> insurgents. `` Force them to surrender or die,'' Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> told troops near <LOCATION> Bacolod </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Negros </ORGANIZATION>' largest city, about 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. He spoke a few hours after three members of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> were killed by soldiers in the nearby town of <LOCATION> Candoni </LOCATION>. On Thursday, rebels killed a policeman and an officer near a <LOCATION> Bacolod </LOCATION> cemetery, police said. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Huchel </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> was taking the rebel threat seriously but `` we feel that our security precautions are adequate.'' Canadian Vice Consul <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said the embassy was trying to verify the reported warning, but so far `` we have no information that we are a target.'' The National Democratic Front branch on <LOCATION> Negros </LOCATION> said Thursday that projects receiving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian aid would be included on its list of targets as it launches increased attacks on <LOCATION> Negros </LOCATION>.

 A Greek fuel tanker carrying up to 29 people broke apart after catching fire in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and search units reported no sign of survivors Friday. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said a merchant vessel recovered the burned body of a man who had a Polish passport and was carrying the ship's registry papers. The victim was identified only as a 41-year-old man. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said there had been 24 crew members and five women, the wives of crewmen, aboard the 500-foot tanker Athenian Venture. The Greek-owned ship had an all-Polish crew, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` The vessel apparently exploded and came apart,'' he said. The bow section, about one-sixth of the ship's length, sank Friday afternoon and the stern was still burning Friday night. Two long-range aircraft would continue patrolling the area where the body was found in case there are survivors, <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said. The crippled tanker, which had not radioed any distress signals, was first spotted just after midnight by the Canadian research ship <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> 370 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Race </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> initially reported one of the tanker's lifeboats had been launched and a Canadian <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said three liferafts and a lifeboat were missing from the tanker, leading to hope there might be survivors. But <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said later there were no indications anyone had lived. `` We ca n't take a great deal of stock in the meaning of that,'' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said of the early report from the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>. `` Further inspection from the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> indicates it -LRB- the lifeboat -RRB- may have burned in the cradle. The loading gear was undisturbed.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is coordinating the search. The Cypriot-registered tanker, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Patron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION>, was headed for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> with a load of gasoline, according to <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. On Friday afternoon the stern of the 18,000-ton tanker was still ablaze in rain squalls and winds exceeding 55 mph that whipped up 5-foot swells. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said there was no indication of the cause of fire. He said the vessel was only identified by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> through contacts with companies known to have tankers in the area. Capt. <PERSON> Loran </PERSON> <PERSON> Strum </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said the tanker was burning fiercely and had already broken in two by the time his ship approached. `` We could see fire through the house windows so she's all burned out in the bridge sector,'' <PERSON> Strum </PERSON> said in a ship-to-shore radio interview. `` I think I could quite safely say it would be impossible for anyone to be alive aboard.'' `` We did get in under the bow to get a look,'' he said. `` The paint is so blistered that there is no name _ there is not even a vestige of a name visible.'' <PERSON> Strum </PERSON>, a 37-year veteran of the sea, said a column of smoke from the tanker's sterm could be seen for 30 miles. Participating in the search were two Canadian <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> aircraft from <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> C-130 Hercules from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> fisheries patrol boat Cape <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> and an Italian-registered ship. In <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, Trade Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosbie </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> an oil slick was spotted but it posed no threat to Canadian fishing grounds because ocean currents would carry the oil to the northeast and farther out to sea.

 A Republican challenge to the pro-Democratic reapportionment of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s congressional districts in 1982 has been rejected by a federal court panel. In a decision made public Friday, the panel voted 2-1 to dismiss a suit by Republicans that claimed the drawing of district boundaries by the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> violated the constitutional rights of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters to equality in voting. The court said a partisan reapportionment is unconstitutional only if one party is effectively `` shut out'' of the political process. Republicans can not make that claim in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, as they hold the governor's office, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, and 40 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats, the court said. `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Republicans represent so potent a political force that it is unnecessary for the judiciary to intervene,'' said the opinion by Judge <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> of the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Zirpoli </PERSON> joined his opinion. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnacke </PERSON> said he would file a dissenting opinion later. Lawyers for Republican officials and voters who filed the suit in 1983 said they would appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and hoped for a ruling that would affect the 1990 congressional elections. Democrats have a 27-18 majority in the state's congressional delegation. The district lines were drawn by the late Rep. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, a Democrat, approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, and signed by Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> indicated Friday that he would like to be the sole candidate in a presidential plebiscite scheduled for later this year. Speaking before about 4,500 women, the 72-year-old president and army commander said Chileans will be asked in the plebiscite to say `` whether they want President <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to stay, or not.'' Under a 1980 Constitution drafted by the military regime, Chileans will vote in 1988 on whether to approve as president a single candidate chosen by the military. Should a plurality vote yes, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will serve an eight-year term starting on March 11, 1989. If most people vote no, an open, competitive presidential election would be scheduled in 1990. It had been widely believed that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> would be the sole candidate, but Friday's speech at <LOCATION> Vina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mar </LOCATION>, a sea resort 75 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, marked the first time that he indicated he was seeking re-election. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> told the crowd Friday that the real question in the plebiscite `` will be whether citizens want the government to continue, or not. Whether they want President <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to continue, or not.'' The women replied with a resounding `` Yes.'' According to the constitution, the candidate in the plebiscite will be chosen by the commanders of the army, the air force, the navy and the national police. As army commander in chief, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> takes part in the nomination. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said the commanders will have `` to decide whether the one who is the president now has done a good job, or a bad job.'' `` It's up to them now to make a decision,'' he told the cheering audience. The navy commander, Adm. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Toribio </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>, and the air force chief, Gen. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON>, have repeatedly stated that they would prefer a civilian candidate. The have also said, however, that should <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> resign his army command, he would become a civilian. No date has been set for the ballot, but officials have hinted it could take place on Sept. 11, the 15th anniversary of the military coup led by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> that ousted elected President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist. In a statement issued at the end of a three-day closed meeting, the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops called Friday on military leaders to pick a candidate and choose a date for the plebiscite promptly. `` The sooner the date and the candidate are known, the more transparent will be the process,'' the Chilean <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> said. The bishops also said they hoped the ballot would be `` secret, free and informed,'' that the number of voters be `` representative'' and that there be a `` guarantee of impartiality'' in the vote count. `` If these conditions are not met, the plebiscite will lack the moral justness needed to sustain its validity,'' the bishops said.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said it is too early to be `` giving out coronation roses'' for front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as the Democrats held their first one-on-one debate Friday and joked about choosing a vice presidential nominee for the fall. `` I look forward to choosing a running mate; <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> looks forward to chosing a running mate,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` But however it goes, when it's all said and done and coming out of -LRB- the Democratic national convention in -RRB- <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, we will come out as a unit to send the Reagan-Bush forces back to private life.'' It was a good-natured, hour-long confrontation between the two surviving Democrats five days before the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary. There was little heated rhetoric in the debate and what existed was directed at Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, echoing the themes from the candidates' day of campaigning across the state. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did press <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seriously on policy toward <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said sponsored terrorism. `` I would be very tough on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor replied. The No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket in the fall was a major topic of the debate _ the first in the two-man end-game for the nomination _ as it has been since <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took a giant step toward the presidential nomination with his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> victory on Tuesday. During the debate sponsored by the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Democratic party, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was asked if he wanted the vice presidential spot. `` It's a bit premature to be giving out coronation roses for the governor and taps for me,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` We're now moving into the last lap of a significant race, and I'm a long-distance runner. I look forward to it.'' Then <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> turned to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and asked in a soft voice: `` Are you interested?'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> smiled and replied, `` You got it, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>.'' Later <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked how he could win in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> in the general election. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> added his analysis: `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on my ticket will win the South,'' provoking laughter from the audience at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> campus in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Asked if he believed polls saying <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as vice president would hurt Dmeocratic chances in the fall, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave a one-word answer: `` No.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was late arriving for the debate, walking onto the stage about three minutes after it began. He shook <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hand and then the two held their clasped hands high, like prizefighters. Both men pleaded with voters to ignore the polls, which give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a big lead in the state. `` People ought to vote conscience, courage and conviction. If they do, they will vote for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or, at least, they will vote for their choice,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I give you a choice. You give me a chance. I will make you a good president ... When I win, there are no more imnpossible American dreams.'' During the debate, both men repeated the themes they used campaigning Friday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> praised the trade bill moving through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, saying it would be `` a tragedy'' if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed the measure over a provision requiring companies to give a 60-day notice before shutting down a plant. `` A very modest, very mild, 60-day notice provision seems to me to be just simple justice for workers and working families,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said while campaigning in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> turned his attention to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Your generation must go beyond war in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he told students at a rally at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` We're not threatened by three million Sandinistas. And, if so, we ca n't be saved by 15,000 Contras.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was spending $ 100,000 on television advertising in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in advance of next Tuesday's primary, a relatively modest amount that reflects his status as overwhelming favorite in the race. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his nomination secure and his general election campaign planning well under way, spent the day fishing in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. His aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, depicted the vice president as being uncomfortable with embattled Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s refusal to resign. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself has not called for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s resignation. The vice president attended a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meeting on Wednesday with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at which two departing <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said they thought <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s presence was damaging the department. In a full day of campaigning in advance of the debate, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of failing to understand what it takes to `` build an economic future and to create good jobs.'' Previewing a line of attack he is expected to use in the fall campaign, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said, `` I do n't see how we are going to bring good jobs and good wages back to the industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> unless we work together. If the vice president does n't understand that, then he should n't be running for president. The Democratic front-runner also attacked the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee-apparent for saying he wants to be `` the education president.'' `` How can he say that after the last seven years?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked a crowd of students at <ORGANIZATION> Mercyhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` After seven years of an administration that has slammed a door in the face of millions of youngsters looking for a chance to go to college? After seven years of treating education ... as if it were a privilege for the few, instead of a right and a necessity for every American?'' In his speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called for a national teaching excellence fund and an education security fund to boost teachers and to make more college loans available to students. He said his ideas would cost an additional $ 250 million in federal spending. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a full campaign day across <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, seeking blue-collar votes in the nation's industrial heartland. The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary is next Tuesday, with <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> voting on May 3. `` You're looking at someone who is a true-blue, dyed-in-the-wool, full-employment Democrat,'' he told workers outside a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Maumee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> plant and at a steel plant in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> emphasized his support for government working in partnership with business and labor to save jobs. Asked by a reporter about a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> statement that government must stay out of the private sector, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> replied at a <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> airport news conference: `` I do n't think the vice president understands what it takes to build an economic future and to create good jobs.'' `` Government should n't do it all. I'm a strong believer in the free enterprise system, but we need a president who will be a strong partner ... who will help with some resources, some support,'' he said. `` It's the public private partnerships that are making the difference all over the country. That's what I've been doing'' in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.

 With the superpower summit only five weeks off, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> chipped away on arms control problems and regional disputes with Soviet leaders Friday but apparently made little headway. `` Maybe we're marking time,'' General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> declared. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> challenged the Soviet leader's assessment. `` From our point of view, we're far from marking time,'' he told reporters at the windup of two days of talks. But he said `` the going is hard'' in trying to conclude an arms treaty in time for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to sign at their May 29-June 2 summit meeting here. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said that during the meeting, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> attacked recent statements by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The agency said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that despite a recent warming in superpower relations, `` sermons are again being delivered to us and we are being instructed on how we should behave ourselves. Our foreign policy is being assessed only negatively while the policy of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration is assessed only positively.'' `` Morever, everything that has been achieved in Soviet-American relations is being ascribed to the policy of strength and `` putting pressure on the Soviets,''' the Soviet leader told <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, according to the agency. `` We are not going to re-educate the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and do not recognize that it has any right to re-educate us,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The Soviet leader was apparently referring to a foreign policy speech given by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Thursday in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. In it, the president said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can not have `` a normal relationship'' unless <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> changes its ways and stops interfering in nations such as <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In a joint statement Friday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet teams said negotiators would deal with the disputed issues `` on a priority basis.'' They reaffirmed their `` strong commitment to make an intensive effort'' to complete the treaty and said the summit `` should mark another important step in the process of building a more stable and constructive relationship.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was scheduled to leave Saturday to visit <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, stop in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to brief the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> on Monday and then fly home. He will hold another session with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, probably in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> around May 10. `` It's pick and shovel work,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said of the uphill effort to complete the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, to crown <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s fourth and probably final meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. At a news conference, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said he could not promise a strategic arms treaty before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit and he criticized any attempt to rush negotiations. `` Soviet-American relations are not some kind of a lightning chess match whose participants are making lightning moves and feverishly hit the buttons of the time clock,'' the Soviet envoy said. `` It is far more important for us to know that the clock of our contacts have been now timed to achieve weighty, tangible and stable positive results.'' He suggested that without a treaty <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could still sign a document stating progress toward an accord. While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms negotiators offered a new proposal in a dispute over air-launched cruise missiles, the treaty to sharply reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet strategic nuclear weapons was still stymied in a dispute over `` Star Wars.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal was to count as nuclear weapons all cruise missiles carried by fighter planes even though some may be conventionally armed. Both sides would have the right to develop air-launched cruises that were not nuclear, and the weapons would not be covered by the treaty. The idea is to bypass a dispute over verifying which of the cruise missiles are long-range nuclear arms. The Soviets agreed to study the proposal, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said at a briefing for reporters under rules of anonymity. Another major stumbling block in completing the treaty is finding ways to monitor <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet weapons to make sure cutbacks are not circumvented. On the regional front, the Soviets again refused to heed <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s appeal for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to declare an arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Since the Soviets have veto power on the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, this means the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is unable to move for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sanctions against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The idea is to try to force compliance with a cease-fire ordered by the council last July in the Iran-Iraq war. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also could not persuade the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to restore diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after a 21-year break or to pledge to increase Jewish emigration, which hit a 15-month high of 984 in March, another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Friday to lift the economic sanctions it imposed on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to oust strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, saying they pose `` a threat to the life of our people.'' The church said in an eight-page pastoral letter that the sanctions `` have strongly hit all the people, above all the poorest and the most humble.'' `` We consider that ... they exceed any strategy of political pressure and constitute by themselves a threat to the life of our people,'' it said. `` They are, therefore, morally unjust. Because of that, we demand that they be suspended immediately. `` In the same way, we reject all forms of military intervention.'' The sanctions block Panamanian government assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; bar payments by all people and organizations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to the Noriega-controlled administration, and ban payments to this administration by all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and organizations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> branches and subsidiaries. The sanctions, combined with closures of the banks and a two-week strike in March, have brought <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy to a virtual standstill. `` The lack of money in circulation is bringing misery and desperation to thousands of Panamanians, and an exodus has started of citizens to foreign countries that is beginning to have worrisome dimensions,'' the hierarchy of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> said in its letter. `` Meanwhile, delinquency in our cities is increasing in an alarming way,'' it said, adding that the crisis is turning <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> into `` a sinister battle camp.'' `` We can not continue like this.'' The letter was signed by Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> and the 10 bishops of this predominantly Roman Catholic nation. It asked the government and its opposition to start bargaining as soon as possible to arrange a solution to end the crisis. The church agreed at the end of March to mediate the dispute, but suspended the effort a week later. Financial analysts said earlier Friday that the government was seeking an international organization to process a backlog of checks that have piled up since <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s banks closed seven weeks ago. Banking regulators have been rebuffed in previous attempts to get European or Latin American banks to take over the clearinghouse operation. A financial analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the officials wanted an international organization that would be `` beyond the scope of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` The objective ... -LRB- is -RRB- to have the accounts with an organization that has diplomatic privileges and immunities,'' he said. Three ministers, including Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Abadia </PERSON>, meanwhile offered their resignations to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s civilian chief executive, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>. A copy of <PERSON> Abadia </PERSON>'s letter of resignation addressed to <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> was obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of the governing coalition, identified the other two men as Nander Pitty <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON>, minister of the presidency, and <PERSON> Candelario </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, recently named to head the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>. The state-run newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Critica </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> was expected to name a `` war Cabinet'' to confront the nation's economic crisis <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of the military and generally considered the real ruler of the country, is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on federal drug trafficking charges. He denied the charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> touched off the crisis on Feb. 26 when he deposed then-President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who tried to fire him a day earlier. The action caused a run on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s banks by nervous depositors. The government ordered the approximately 120 banks closed on March 3 after acknowledging it did n't have enough money to cover withdrawals. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had an estimated $ 50 million on deposit in American banks, but that money was frozen by lawsuits filed to stop the Noriega-controlled government from withdrawing it. With little money, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> has been unable to conduct a clearing operation for thousands of checks. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a regulatory agency, allowed the banks to reopen but only to accept deposits. Customers still can not withdraw cash.

 An estimated 30 minority students took over a dean's office at <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, the eve of Parents' Weekend at the prestigious liberal arts school. A spokesman for the students who declined to identify himself said in a telephone interview that black, Hispanic, Asian and Polynesian students occupied <ORGANIZATION> Jenness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> at 8:30 a.m. The only member of the dean's staff in the building at the time, a secretary, left at their request. `` We took this action to protest the administration's unwillingness to address substantially fundamental issues relating to minority concerns at the college,'' the group, called the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement `` These issues relate to recruitment, hiring goals and policies with regard to minority faculty, staff and students,'' the statement said. `` They also relate to the broader issues of minority representation in the curriculum.'' Some 10 percent of the school's 278 faculty members and 13 percent of its 2,000 students are members of minority groups, school spokesmen said. At a Friday evening news conference, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, who said he was a senior from <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, and one of the protesters, said his group had set up a formal meeting Sunday with college President <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>. He said the outcome could determine whether the building takeover continues. <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> said the protesters had spoken by phone with with administrators and were not asked to leave the building. He said they were asked _ and agreed _ to keep away from confidential files. Witnesses said the protesters barricaded the doors and pulled down the window shades in the Victorian house, which is serving as a makeshift dean's office while the main administration building is renovated. The occupiers also hung a banner reading, `` By any means necessary _ We shall not be moved.'' Shortly after noon, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> of the College <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Fix </PERSON> issued a statement saying college officials had met with the students to discuss `` the important goals we share.'' `` All of us in the college are prepared to continue such discussions in any atmosphere that is conducive to the free and open exchange of ideas,'' Fix said. College spokeswoman <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Berek </PERSON> said she did not know if any meetings had been arranged, although Fix said he spoke to students briefly through a window. As of late afternoon, things at the scene were quiet, said <PERSON> Berek </PERSON>. The students have vowed to stay put until the college responds to their demands, which are apparently the same concerns that many of the same students sent to Oakley March 4. `` After receiving inadequate response, we decided this action was necessary,'' a protester said. The protest came a day before the dedication of a baseball field and track by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> baseball team and an alumnus. <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON>, whose son is a sophomore at the elite school, is one of hundreds of alumni expected to return to the campus for the parents' weekend. In addition to criticism of minority hiring and curriculum, the protesters' spokesman said they were angry that a college advisory committee recently voted against urging three pharmaceutical companies in which the college owns stock to withdraw from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Berek </PERSON> said the committee decided it was important for blacks in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to be able to buy the medicines the companies made. In February, minority students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, more than 40 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Williamstown </LOCATION>, occupied buildings on their campuses for several days to protest racial discrimination. Those protests ended after the heads of the schools signed agreements to increase funding of minority projects and make other concessions. Students at <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Middleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, continued their sit-in at an administration building for a fifth day Friday in a protest of the school's investments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Former Methodist minister <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> is liable for the near-fatal choking of his wife a year ago, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> judge ruled Friday. Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON> made a default judgment against <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> in a civil lawsuit filed by <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON>. Although he was served twice with the suit, <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>, 40, never responded in court to the allegation he brutally attacked his wife. `` If you bring allegations against the defendant and you give the defendant notice of the allegations and an opportunity to come in and respond to those allegations, and he refuses to do that, the court can hold the defendant liable and hold those allegations as true,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, attorney for Mrs. <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON>, said Friday. The decision was announced a year and a day after Mrs. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>, 39, was found lying unconscious on her garage floor. She has been in a coma since the attack. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>, former senior minister at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, has claimed he was doing research at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on the night of the attack. The suit asks for unspecified damages for Mrs. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> and her family. The <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s two children are living with family friends in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said a jury trial will be scheduled to decide the amount of damages, probably this summer. He said he plans to subpoena <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> for the trial and seek a warrant for his arrest. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s father, declined comment when reached by telephone Friday. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON> was not in his office or at home when phoned for comment. After a suicide attempt following the attack, <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> refused to talk with police or answer questions before a grand jury. No criminal charges have been filed, although <PERSON> Mulder </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> is the only suspect. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> surrendered his minister's credentials and moved to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where he rented an apartment with <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Papillon </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Papillon </PERSON>, a psychologist, told a grand jury she had been seeing <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> and they had discussed marriage before the attack on his wife. <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Papillon </PERSON> broke their lease on their apartment about two weeks ago, the landlord said earlier this week. Officials say they believe <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> is in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. There was no telephone listing for <PERSON> Railey </PERSON> in the area.

<HEAD>Heart of Unidentified Man Used in Transplant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The heart of an unidentified man found unconscious on a sidewalk was transplanted after he died, causing debate Friday among medical ethicists, one of whom called the procedure `` incredible.'' `` It seems to me this does not sit well with the way we've been doing things,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, an ethics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> law center. The heart transplant was the first at <ORGANIZATION> Hoag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, 40 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The recipient was Dr. <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphreys </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Fountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, a former staff doctor who was suffering from degenerative heart disease and suffered two heart attacks in the past nine months. He was awake, alert and in good condition Friday, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Love </PERSON>. The donor was an unidentified man believed to be a 20-year-old Costa <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> resident who was found unconscious in front of a convenience store, hospital officials said. Police recovered from the man a temporary work card issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, and were checking the identity of the man pictured on the card, said police Lt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` To take vital organs out of someone who is not identified is really incredible,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Annas </PERSON>, a law and ethics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` If other people have done it, they have n't talked about it in the newspaper, that's for sure.'' `` It seems to me that that is a variation from practice in this country where someone generally has to agree to the donation,'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said. The man was declared brain dead Tuesday after he was brought into the hospital's emergency room, said Dr. <PERSON> Aldan </PERSON> <PERSON> Raney </PERSON>, one of the cardiac surgeons who performed the transplant. The donor also had traces of alcohol and cocaine in his urine, hospital officials said. They said doctors followed guidelines established in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Uniform Anatomical Gift Act that require a 24-hour police search for identification and relatives and questioning of visitors to the donor. The man had no visitors. <PERSON> Raney </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusman </PERSON>, the surgeons that performed the transplant, have performed more than 77 heart transplants between them. <PERSON> Annas </PERSON> said the hospital should have let at least 24 hours, rather than six, lapse between the time the donor was declared dead and the time the transplant began. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, an ethics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplantation </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I'm not sure there's any serious abuse if they're complying with applicable law.'' `` First of all, we're dealing with someone who is dead. It's not like they're harming the person. That body is either going to get cremated or buried,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said.

 The top investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION>'s nuclear manager `` knowingly and willfully'' misrepresented safety conditions at a TVA plant. Disclosing publicly the conclusions of an investigation which was referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> months ago, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION>, testified that he believed that <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear chief, deliberately misled the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>. White has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The issue concerns a March 20, 1986 letter written by White in which he assured the regulatory agency that there were no `` pervasive'' quality assurance problems at the still-unlicensed Watts Bar nuclear plant at <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> also questioned a subsequent White letter in which the <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> manager told the commission that an independent review group had found no serious problems at the plant after a thorough study In fact, said <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, several of the men cited by <PERSON> White </PERSON> as participants of that group told investigators that they `` had n't reviewed the matter, nor did they discuss it with Mr White.'' Others signed off on a short memo about <ORGANIZATION> Watts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION>, but filed no longer report. <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> defended White in a statement released late Thursday, saying, `` The <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> board has complete confidence in ... White. The board fully supports his managment of <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear recovery program ... We believe it is important to note that there has been disagreement among the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> staff itself over whether <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> misled the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>.'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight and investigations, criticized the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> for recently approving the restart of another <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> nuclear plant, <LOCATION> Sequoyah </LOCATION>, while `` there were unresolved questions concerning the integrity and believability of the <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> nuclear managers. But <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said `` the commission concluded that immediate regulatory action prior to restart of <LOCATION> Sequoyah </LOCATION> was not necessary as a result of the -LRB- <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> -RRB- investigation. This limited conclusion does not mean that there is no regulatory action anticipated as a result of the findings.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has declined any comment on the status of the White case since <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> referred it last October. But an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> review group, headed by Assistant Director of Operations <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, disagreed with <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>' conclusion that <PERSON> White </PERSON>'s misstatements were deliberate. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> White </PERSON> was deliberately playing word games, based on consultations with aides and his personal attorney, when he said there were no `` pervasive'' breakdowns at Watts Bar. White, said <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, apparently was relying on a definition of pervasive as `` 100 per cent.'' While it was technically correct that the plant did n't violate all quality assurance standards, it did have serious and widespread problems, according to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said <PERSON> White </PERSON>'s letters amount to `` material false statements,'' but the <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> group concluded that while they may have been off base, they did not violate the law. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, D-Tenn., defended <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who was brought in to salvage the <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s long-plagued nuclear operation He said <PERSON> White </PERSON> is `` caught in the spider's web of confusion and misunderstanding.''

The new regulation, which outlaws smoking on flights of less than two hours, carries stiff fines for violations: up to $ 1,000 for smoking and $ 2,000 for tinkering with lavatory smoke alarms. It applies to around 80 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flights, or an estimated 13,600 a day.

<HEAD>Research Society Helps Bring Sex Out of China's Closet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARBIN, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sex is coming out of the closet in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with the help of a group of sociologists and medical personnel who want the Chinese to have happy, healthy sex lives. `` We are very unconservative,'' said <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ling </PERSON>, director of the Obstetricl and <ORGANIZATION> Gynecological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION> and a member of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s only <ORGANIZATION> Sex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The 177-member society was set up here last year to coordinate efforts of medical workers and sociologists at several <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION> hospitals and institutions in addressing sexual problems. <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION>, with its Soviet-style architecture and heavy industry in northeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, seems an unlikely place for sex research and the study and treatment of sexual disorders. But the city of 2 million has the nation's first centers for treatment of male and female sexual disorders and the unique <ORGANIZATION> Sex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Members of the society say <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can no longer ignore the sexual problems that many Chinese live with. `` Sex has long been a forbidden subject,'' said sociologist <PERSON> Gao </PERSON> <PERSON> Caiqin </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marriage </ORGANIZATION> and Family Planning. `` No one was willing to talk about sex or sex problems, but it is a very important problem.'' `` No other disorder in the world is like sexual disorder in that it affects both partners,'' said <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiqi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> and Consultations of Sexual Disorders of Men. `` Sooner or later, we had to establish this clinic,'' said <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jin </PERSON>, director of the No. 4 Hospital, which houses the male clinic. `` We ca n't avoid this issue. It's a part of us, but in the past, nobody was willing to talk about it.'' He said the clinic has received 4,000 letters since it opened two years ago and has a year-long waiting list for treatment. Similar clinics have been started since in other parts of the country, but <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION> is regarded as the leader in the field. The male sexual disorders clinic has treated more than 3,000 patients, and the Center for Treatment and Consultations of Sexual Disorders of Women, at the Obstetrical and <ORGANIZATION> Gynecological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, has handled 5,000 cases, of which 3,000 were outpatients. The open attitudes of the research society members are in sharp contrast to those of a traditionally puritanical and moralistic <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The female sexual disorders center, for example, encourages women to experience orgasms during intercourse. Some problems the clinics handle are unique to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. With the gradual rise in the standard of living, young people are reaching puberty earlier. The age at which girls begin to menstruate has dropped from 13 years to 11, and boys reach puberty at age 13 rather than 15. However, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has a strict policy of late marriage. The legal age for marriage is 20 for women and 22 for men, the highest in the world. While late marriage helps keep <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s birth rate down, it creates a nation of sexually frustrated young people. The clinics offer them help. Members of the research society acknowledged that they have treated homosexuals and sufferers of venereal diseases, two problems that Chinese officials had previously claimed no longer existed in the country. `` We do have homosexuals,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. He added that the clinic's surveys indicate three of every 1,000 men in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is homosexual No figures were available on lesbians in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ling </PERSON> of the Obstetrical and <ORGANIZATION> Gynecological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said their numbers are few and the female sexual disorders clinic has not treated any. The Chinese regard homosexuality as abnormal. The `` cure'' used by the male sexual disorders clinic is to condition the homosexual not to be excited by men. It either applies electric shocks or gives traditional Chinese medicine that induces vomiting. Another problem dealt with by the society members is a growing number of young people engaging in premarital sex. `` There is an obvious increase from the past of having sex before marriage,'' <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> said. She added that no complete figures were available but her hospital has seen an increase in the number of unmarried pregnant women, ranging in age from 14 to 25. Seventy percent to 75 percent of the abortions the hospital performs on women in their second trimester of pregnancy are on unwed mothers, <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> said. The incidences of premarital sex in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, however, still falls far below world levels, <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> said. Results of surveys of engaged couples have shown that more than 90 percent were still virgins. The society members say they fight a battle on two fronts: against what they call the ignorance and superstitions of traditional thinking and the sexual freedoms of Western society. `` We do n't talk about creativity in sex life,'' said <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Ran </PERSON>, deputy director the No. 4 Hospital and secretary-general of the research society. `` We advise them how to have a healthy sex life.'' Society members insist, however, that their ultimate goal is to help people adjust sexually so that they can contribute to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s socialist modernization

 <LOCATION> KATUTURA </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Shifidi </PERSON>, an unwed mother of five who washes floors in a hospital for blacks, wants to bring her father's killers to justice. To do that, she is taking <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s president to court. `` I am not afraid of him,'' she said. `` He did something wrong.'' President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> halted the prosecution of six soldiers charged with killing her father, the 56-year-old political activist <PERSON> Immanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Shifidi </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Shifidi </PERSON>, who says her $ 100 monthly salary barely pays the rent and utilities for her cramped four-room house, is the lone applicant in legal papers challenging <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s order. But she was not the only one upset when <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> blocked the trial in March of four white officers and two black enlisted men. Across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the territory commonly known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, the order brought an outcry from legal experts and liberal politicians. <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s attorney general had accused the six soldiers of arranging for 54 black soldiers to dress in civilian clothes, arm themselves with knives and clubs, and ride by bus from a faraway army base to disrupt an opposition political rally in <LOCATION> Katutura </LOCATION>, a black township outside <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, the territorial capital. <PERSON> Shifidi </PERSON>, one of about 2,000 people at the legal outdoor rally, was fatally stabbed Nov. 30, 1986. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s critics accused him of hypocrisy for intervening in this case just a few days after saying he should not interfere in the case of the `` <ORGANIZATION> Sharpeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION>,'' a group of South African blacks sentenced to hang for complicity in a mob killing. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> rejected worldwide appeals for clemency for the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> defendants, whose execution has been stayed while they seek a new trial. In the <LOCATION> Shifidi </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> invoked a section of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s Defense Act, which empowers him to grant immunity to any soldier for any action committed `` in good faith ... in connection with the prevention or suppression of terrorism in any operational area. `` The law is intended to protect soldiers who do wrong,'' claimed Ms. <PERSON> Shifidi </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Hartmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruppel </PERSON>, at his office in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> Ms. <PERSON> Shifidi </PERSON>'s application, filed in the territorial <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on March 30, seeks to invalidate <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s order so that the murder trial can proceed. No date has been set for a hearing, and the South African government has not indicated what steps it will take to oppose the application. Ms. <PERSON> Shifidi </PERSON>, who wore a `` Workers Unite'' T-shirt during an interview at her <LOCATION> Katutura </LOCATION> home, said repeatedly that `` there is no justice'' under South African rule, but she expressed hope her application would succeed. Speaking in the language of her Ovambo tribe, with a friend translating, Ms. <PERSON> Shifidi </PERSON>, 35, said the accused soldiers `` must face the court and accept whatever sentence the court hands down.'' Her father was a founding member of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, an independence movement that has been waging a guerrilla war against South African rule for 22 years. He served 18 years in prison for <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> activities, then lived with his daughter in <LOCATION> Katutura </LOCATION> for two years before his death. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s political wing is legal, and the organization sponsored the rally at which <PERSON> Shifidi </PERSON> was killed. His daughter also was at the rally but was not nearby when he was stabbed. Under territorial laws, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is permitted to function as a political organization, although the activities of its guerrilla wing are outlawed. <PERSON> Ruppel </PERSON> said there is no evidence <PERSON> Shifidi </PERSON> was a pre-selected target for assassination. Rather, the lawyer added, it appeared that army officers sought to discredit <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> and intimidate its supporters by provoking violence at its rally. The application filed by Ms. <PERSON> Shifidi </PERSON> contends <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> had no basis for concluding that the six soldiers acted in good faith for the purpose of combatting terrorism. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> `` failed to apply his mind to the facts ... or acted in bad faith, or grossly unreasonably,'' the application says. The application also questions whether the <LOCATION> Katutura </LOCATION> soccer field where the rally took place, now called <LOCATION> Shifidi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, could be accurately described as part of the army's operational area. But <PERSON> Ruppel </PERSON> said he expected the government to contend that the operational area extends to wherever soldiers are on duty. `` It moves as quickly as you can move soldiers,'' he said. The section of the Defense Act invoked by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> says the president can act only if he deems that continuation of the court proceedings would harm `` the national interest.'' Two previous trials in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> have been stopped by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> under terms of the Defense Act, <PERSON> Ruppel </PERSON> said. In each case, he added, challenges were filed; one was rejected and the other is pending. <PERSON> Ruppel </PERSON> said it was possible that if South African authorities lose to Ms. <PERSON> Shifidi </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> Windhoek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, they would appeal to an appellate court in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 Each day Indian newspapers recount the latest killings by <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> radicals in the province of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. But 700 miles to the south, a Sikh general heads the Indian army's southern command; imposing <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> doormen usher guests into plush hotels in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>; Sikh drivers in turbans steer taxicabs through <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>'s chaotic traffic. A <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> owns one of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s largest bottling plants. <PERSON> Maninder </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a Sikh cricket player, is one of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s sports stars. Known for their beards, turbans and, lately, the brutal campaign for a separate Sikh nation in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, Sikhs are an integral part of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and have been since long before the country's independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. `` More than half the people hanged by the British in the freedom movement were Sikhs,'' said <PERSON> Kushwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a journalist and writer known for his novels about Indian independence and a scholarly history of his own Sikh people. Sikhs are a mere 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people and most live in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, a rich farming state on the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border. It is there that radicals have killed more than 770 people this year in their demand for an independent Sikh nation. But perhaps 4 million other Sikhs are scattered around the rest of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. They have a reputation for being aggressive and hardworking, and many have achieved success. In a survey of Sikhs outside <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, the Statesman newspaper found them running factories in <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state in the north, trading in cloth in <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> in the east, and active in the <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kerala </LOCATION>, the southernmost Indian state. In <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s business capital, <ORGANIZATION> Sikhs </ORGANIZATION> have almost a monopoly in the auto parts trade, and perhaps 10,000 Sikh taxi drivers ply the city's streets. In much of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, in fact, the Sikhs own or drive many of the cabs, buses and trucks, making them familiar to tourists. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, the military-looking doormen at five-star hotels are often Sikhs, chosen for their height, which is accentuated by the turban. With the martial tradition of their religion, Sikhs also have made their way in the army. During World War I, when Indian soldiers served in the British army, 14 of the 22 British military crosses warded to Indians went to Sikhs. Sikhs still make up 10 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s army and even more among the officer corps. In contrast to its later military role, <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION> began as a pacifist faith in 15th-century <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, founded by a Hindu in reaction to the bloody rivalries of Hindus and Moslems. The founder, <PERSON> Guru </PERSON> <PERSON> Nanak </PERSON>, rejected <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION>'s caste system but kept many of its rituals, combining them with Islam's belief in a single deity. Inevitably, though, the Sikh faith was drawn into the clash of Hindus and Moslems. After the Moguls beheaded the ninth Sikh prophet _ a defender of Hindus _ his son, Guru <PERSON> Gobind </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, turned the Sikhs to a warrior path in 1699. The son decreed that all Sikh men carry a knife, be soldiers of the faith and use the name <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, which means `` lion.'' <PERSON> Gobind </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> also gave the Sikhs their distinctive look by ruling they must never shave or cut their hair, which is worn wrapped under the turban. Later, it was an Indian tradition for one son in a Hindu family to be reared a Sikh, to act as a defender of both religions. The Sikh radical campaign in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, however, has strained the bond between the two religions. After Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards in 1984, rioting in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> killed 3,000 people, most of them Sikhs. Even today, Sikhs outside <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> say they are made to feel separate by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s dominant Hindus, who are 80 percent of the country's people. `` The Sikh is regarded with suspicion,'' said <PERSON> Kushwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who noted that Sikhs complain of especially stringent security checks at airports and that <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> taxi drivers have more serious problems at police checkpoints. <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who runs a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> taxi stand, said five of his six Sikh drivers have cut their hair and shaved to avoid being associated with the radicals in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. `` It means a special check the moment the driver is a Sikh. They stop us, make us open the boot -LRB- car trunk -RRB-, want to know what's in the passengers' luggage. It's not our right to ask the passengers what they carry.'' <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, whose own house was set ablaze during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, wore a bright red turban during an interview at his taxi stand. `` As long as the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> problem goes on, the problem here is not going to be solved,'' he said. <PERSON> Kushwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, the writer, said Sikhs outside <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> are the sharpest critics of the separatist concept because they are most hurt by it. `` They're developing a feeling of being held as hostages. They bear the brunt of the Hindu backlash when it comes.'' He also said Sikhs elsewhere in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> often have no connection with <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Many, he added, fled from Moslem <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to various parts of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> when the two countries were divided at independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. The Statesman newspaper also found that most Sikhs outside <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> oppose a separate Sikh state because they have built lives elsewhere. Some have taken up the Telegu language of <LOCATION> Andhra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Malayalam </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kerala </LOCATION> in place of the <LOCATION> Punjabi </LOCATION> tongue. <PERSON> Kushwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said, however, that opposition to a separate <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION>, the radicals' name for their would-be country, did not mean the Sikhs approved of the government's handling of the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> situation. He said Sikhs everywhere were disappointed in the government's failure to foster industry in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and were hurt by its refusal to prosecute <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> agitators blamed for starting the 1984 riots Asked if the violence in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and the reaction to it made Sikh's feel less Indian, he responded: `` I feel the Indian government is n't Indian enough.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans loved `` The Jewel in the Crown,'' the TV epic that made <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> famous, and if the Pakistan-born actor is right about his upcoming series, Americans will also warm to `` The Black Tower.'' `` If you're an Anglophile living in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, you're going to love it,'' the 35-year-old actor said of the six-part thriller, which starts April 28 on PBS stations. `` It projects a very countrified, rarefied atmosphere.'' The fourth miniseries to be adapted from a P.D. <PERSON> James </PERSON> thriller, the show brings <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> back to the screen as Chief Inspector <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalgliesh </PERSON>, who this time is investigating a series of murders at a private nursing home, <PERSON> Toynton </PERSON> <PERSON> Grange </PERSON>, in the English countryside. <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> plays the elegantly dressed <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Court </PERSON>, <PERSON> Toynton </PERSON> <PERSON> Grange </PERSON>'s principal benefactor and a man whose motives may not be what they seem The actor said the mystery genre attracted him to the project: `` I have to admit I do like whodunits, and <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> is an actor I had wanted to work with for a long time.'' But he said he would have altered the tone of the show. `` I do n't think they make <PERSON> Dalgliesh </PERSON> angry enough,'' he said in an interview. `` They do n't want it dirty; they do n't want <PERSON> Dalgliesh </PERSON> to be down market. It is a very relaxed piece of TV.'' It's also a distinct contrast, both in subject matter and style, from the show to which he owes his success. As <PERSON> Hari </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON>, the British-reared Indian wrongly charged with rape in `` The Jewel in the Crown,'' <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> impressed critics with his stirring portrait of a man caught in an affair he knows must end tragically. `` I was lucky enough to be launched into the marketplace with the blessing of a series like ` Jewel,''' the actor recalled of the show, which also brought such actors as <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pigott-Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dance </PERSON> to world attention. `` In essence, it allows you to be seen as a serious actor on television, and those opportunities are rare.'' He spoke less flatteringly of some of his other credits, such as the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> TV-movie `` Harem,'' which aired in February 1986 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The less said of that the better,'' <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> said of the four-hour show starring <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ava </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> in which he was cast as a Turkish rebel. `` The disaster of the whole piece was nobody could decide whether to be tongue-in-cheek or serious.'' However, he said Americans had no exclusive hold on mediocre television. `` We have crap TV over here, as well; we have lousy movies as well,'' <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> said. `` ` Jewel' comes out, and then there's a hiatus.'' He expressed high hopes for his upcoming project _ an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> drama series tentatively called `` The Clinic,'' co-starring <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Learned </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and written by <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Presson </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. `` I have a lot of time for <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>. She's a lady with a lot of integrity,'' <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a prolific and much admired writer who has created numerous works including the stage play and film, `` The Prime of Miss <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodie </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> portrays <PERSON> Ved </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahari </PERSON>, an India-born, England-educated psychiatrist who lives in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The series is scheduled to debut in the summer. The actor, who lives in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s suburban <LOCATION> Surrey </LOCATION> with his wife, actress <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, and two daughters, said he looks forward to the day when he is considered for all parts regardless of skin color. Two of his more prominent roles were as Indians in `` The Far Pavilions'' and `` A Passage to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>.'' `` Every actor is a minority of one, whether he be fat, thin, Chinese, a woman,'' <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> said. `` I do n't want to be seen as that. I'm a working actor. I want to be the modern-day Anglo-Asian.''

<HEAD>`Born in East L.A.' To Open in Mexico</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The irreverent <PERSON> Cheech </PERSON> <PERSON> Marin </PERSON>, whose comic `` Born in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>'' movie is about to open here, is n't worried that Mexicans might not get the joke. `` It feels real good,'' he said. `` I think this is the place where it will be the biggest hit of all the <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries, including <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` I expect people will see it and identify with it. I expect they will laugh a lot, and be moved a lot.'' The idea started as a song parody of <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>'s `` Born in the U.S.A.'' monster hit, then grew into a popular video before becoming the movie written by, directed by and starring <PERSON> Marin </PERSON>. `` I could n't afford to pay anyone else,'' he joked. The story is of a third-generation <PERSON> Mexican-American </PERSON> caught up in an immigration dragnet and deported to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> where, <PERSON> Marin </PERSON> says, he is `` a fish out of water'' who must sneak back across the border. Much of the movie was filmed in <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s northwestern city on the border with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` Born in East L.A.'' earned generally good reviews and decent box office results in its release last year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Perhaps more important as far as <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> is concerned, it established his reputation for working alone, without longtime partner <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chong </PERSON> in the Cheech and <PERSON> Chong </PERSON> comic duo. Asked if the split is definite, <PERSON> Marin </PERSON> replied: `` Only for the next 150 years.'' The movie will be released in Mexican theaters in the second half of May, under the Spanish title `` Un <LOCATION> Picaro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>,'' or `` A Rascal From <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.'' The subtitle is `` The Craziest of Them All.'' Just as the character in his movie, <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> is a third-generation <PERSON> Mexican-American </PERSON>. He has learned Spanish in the past few years in his travels but still has an interpreter standing by for his appearances here. `` At least I do n't say, ` I used to want a beer right now,''' he said of his progress. `` I like it; it's a beautiful language.'' He said there is nothing derogatory at all about <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or about the immigration problem in the movie. `` You realize the sadness within the situation,'' he said in an interview. `` I did n't come to <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION> to make fun of people. `` It's more learning about the people who cross the border. I wanted to humanize the whole story _ so they're not just numbers. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs the labor, but they persecute the people. It's unjust.'' Mexicans have a notoriously thin-skinned view of foreign humor about them, and that easily could be true for jokes coming from Mexican-Americans as well. <PERSON> Marin </PERSON> said the only screening so far in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was at a <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> festival, and it went over well. He also said the movie was a hit at the Latin American film festival in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> late last year and has been shown as well in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` So if it's not a big hit in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, there's something wrong with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' he said with a big laugh. The movie was released at about the same time as the huge success of <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>'s `` La Bamba'' brought attention to the Hispanic market in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Stand and Deliver,'' the new movie starring <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON> about a mathematics teacher in a largely Mexican-American <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> high school, also is a smash. `` They're hits, and there will be more,'' <PERSON> Marin </PERSON> said. `` It's time _ all the people have put in their dues. When `` The Milagro Beanfield War'' is mentioned, however, he replied: `` I do n't really consider that Hispanic ... unless <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> had Mexican parents we do n't know about it.'' Cheech and <PERSON> Chong </PERSON> built much of their career on drug humor, but <PERSON> Marin </PERSON> says that topic is behind him. `` We were only allotted 10,000 drug jokes _ and they were gone,'' he said. He also said the innocent era has passed as well, comparing the old jokes about three hippies passing a joint to the modern reality of a 14-year-old selling crack, armed with a Uzi. <PERSON> Marin </PERSON> said about two years ago he split with <PERSON> Chong </PERSON>, got a divorce and found himself deeply in debt. `` So I hit the typewriter,'' he said. `` That's always been my salvation.''

<HEAD>Although Controverial, Beauty Pageants are a New Rage in Taiwan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHIRLEY LAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Banned for 23 years as an extravagance, beauty pageants are suddenly the rage in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> despite protests from feminists and old-guard conservatives. The government lifted the ban in October and the country's calendar already is crammed with two national and two international beauty contests, culminating with the glitzy 1988 Miss Universe Pageant on May 24 in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> Most Taiwanese appear to favor the government's decision to end the ban; one high school went so far as to hold its own pageant to select teen-age students to compete in the 1988 Miss Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> competition April 16. Others are less enthusiastic, however. A small group of retired soldiers, arguing that only one's mother can be considered the most beautiful woman, have threatened to set themselves ablaze at the Miss Universe contest unless authorities reimpose the ban. `` We know beauty pageants are controversial, but we also know most people enjoy a diversified life that includes such pageants,'' said <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> <PERSON> Han-hsien </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official who supervises the contests. But <PERSON> Tseng </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsu-pai </PERSON>, a 93-year-old adviser to President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON>, wants the pageants banned once again on grounds that they are `` luring women into abandoning work and study for the pursuit of fame and money.'' Beauty contests were banned in 1964 by a government that found them an unneeded extravagance when <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> was n't as wealthy as it is now. Early pageants were derided as indulgences by top officials who were closely tied to the contestants. For example, the 1961 winner, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Li-ling </PERSON>, was married to the son of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s governor at the time, <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> Chi-jou. Prudishness also may have been a factor in the ban. According to an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> document, leading military officials thought the winner of an early Miss <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> pageant became a strip dancer in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and urged then-President <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> to ban further contests. But with onset of prosperity, public opinion surveys indicate that most Taiwanese welcome the return of beauty contests and hope the two international pageants to be held in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> _ Miss Universe and <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wonderland </ORGANIZATION> on April 29 _ will help the island win new friends. Nearly 1,000 women overwhelmed two local pageants leading to the international contests, but not without controversy. After a televised preliminary round to chose <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s representative for the Miss Wonderland contest, several people telephoned to complain of contestants wearing swimsuits with plunging necklines About 25 feminists demonstrated outside the hotel where the finals were held April 1, and they hoisted signs that read: `` Women are not commercial products.'' The group argued that pageants judge women by their figures and not by traditional standards of Chinese beauty, such as intelligence and elegance. Four retired soldiers also showed up outside the hotel to distribute anti-pageant fliers. `` Beauty contests are insults to mothers,'' said one, <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheng-chien </PERSON>. `` Nobody in the world is more beautiful than one's mother. <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> told reporters he and 10 other veterans will immolate themselves if the government does not ban the pageants. The second national contest was held April 16 to select <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s contestants for the Miss Universe, <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and Miss World pageants Two contestants dropped out because their parents thought it shameful to wear swimsuits in public. One of the three winners, 18-year-old <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi-ning </PERSON>, was sent to the pageant with four classmates by the <ORGANIZATION> Chuang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ching </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s Board of Directors and faculty The school held its own beauty contest to select them and then provided wardrobes and intensive model training. Miss <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> told a news conference after winning that she would leave school for a year to meet her responsibilities as a winner. Despite the controversies, pageant organizer <PERSON> Shieh </PERSON> Tung-min maintains that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> `` can not ignore that pageants will help foreign countries better understand the prosperity and success of our country.'' Not so, responded <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuang-kuo </PERSON>, professor of psychology at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who is quick to say pageants are not the apex of cultural activity. `` The world may get to know <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s name from pageants, but pageants have nothing to do with raising the nation's profile,'' he said.

 What really happened to <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>? Her advisers have promised she'll spill all by week's end, either to a federal prosecutor of their liking or to reporters. `` The story will be told,'' vowed the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> minister who appointed himself <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s protector and keeper of her silence. `` The public will not see this end without ever knowing <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON>'s story We owe that to the people who have supported her,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said in an interview. Only scattered pieces of an unsolved puzzle have emerged in the five months since the former cheerleader stepped off a bus into the evening shadows and what she said was an abduction punctuated by sexual and racial abuse. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, then 15, was found dazed and wriggling in a garbage bag outside her old apartment Nov. 28, four days after she disappeared. Her hair was chopped, her skin smeared with dog feces, and the words `` nigger'' and `` KKK'' were scrawled on her torso. According to relatives and her sketchy accounts to police, she was raped, sodomized and abused by three to six white men, one of whom she alleged was a policeman with blond hair and a mustache. Hospital tests, however, showed no signs of sexual abuse. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s refusal to tell her story to a state grand jury has brought suspicion, innuendo, doubt, gossip, questions about a cop's suicide and the sizzle of racial tension to this working class village in the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> Bewildered investigators, handcuffed by <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s reticence, are nowhere near making an arrest. `` That -LRB- silence -RRB- ultimately might jeopardize and prejudice the opportunity to bring charges against anybody. It's been perplexing,'' said state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, supervising eight investigators and 12 prosecutors on the case. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> hinted the grand jury would look at possible obstruction of justice by <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>, militant activists known for raising the voltage in racially charged cases. `` There will be all facts taken into account, including the behavior of the lawyers,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` I challenge him to arrest us and prove in court that we're obstructing justice,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> retorted later in the interview `` He should quit bluffing.'' <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s advisers have led marches through <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, made charges at news conferences and postured before cameras. This legal and media circus around the case has also had its sideshows. Entertainer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Essence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, offered a $ 25,000 reward to find the truth. Heavyweight boxing champion <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> and promoter <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> spent six hours with <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> on Feb. 13. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> gave her his $ 30,000, diamond-studded Rolex watch. He and King pledged $ 50,000 apiece to pay her college tuition. But the truth is unknown. And no place is more eager for the truth than <ORGANIZATION> Wappingers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION>, a village of 5,000 whites and 100 blacks 70 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Townspeople are doubly weary _ of the reporters who come to glue together shreds of an account that has given headline writers for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> tabloids a workout, and of waiting to hear the truth. `` The best thing would be for this bimbo to open her mouth and tell what happened or drop the whole thing,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose-White </PERSON>, 42, a substitute teacher, a lifelong resident and a black. `` People are getting sick of it. We want to know what happened and who did it. All we're getting is second-hand information.'' <PERSON> Rose-White </PERSON> also challenged the girl's allegation of racial motives, saying, `` My sister asked me how come she's walked this town for 40 years and the Klan waited for <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>.'' For now, the case has more questions than answers. On Nov. 24, <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> skipped classes at R.C. <ORGANIZATION> Ketcham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> to visit a former boyfriend in jail, 13 miles away. She rode the bus back and was last seen about 8:45 p.m. at a bus stop a mile from her home. Four days later, former neighbors saw her crawling into the garbage bag on the ground outside her family's recently vacated apartment, where her mother had just checked for unforwarded mail. Her clothing was different from when she vanished, and her soiled denim jacket was in an idle washing machine in the building. Lt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCord </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> police said her mother, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON>, first reported the girl missing at 2:02 p.m. Saturday _ 17 minutes after she was found. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> gave police the barest scraps of information, writing brief notes accompanied by grunts and nods. She said she was abducted by two white men in a dark car, one with blond hair and a light mustache who flashed a police-type badge and wore a holster. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> said she was driven to a wooded area where more white men waited to rape and sodomize her. One urinated in her mouth, she said. She remembered few other details. At a hospital, a black policeman asked who did it. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> pointed to his badge and scrawled on a pad: `` white cop.'' Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported how, 18 months ago, a classmate of <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s told a similar tale of being abducted and assaulted by two men in a dark car. <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION> police found she concocted the story to conceal abuse by a family member. A friend said <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> had recently angered her stepfather, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, by staying out late after a party. King, 40, a bus driver known around town for a quick temper, spent seven years in prison for fatally shooting his first wife. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Croshier </PERSON>, bartender at <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>'s, said patrons question <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s account because of the family's known domestic problems. `` The general feeling is it's a family affair,'' <PERSON> Croshier </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, the investigation has had its fits and starts. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney, quit the case because one of his assistants, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON>, was a friend of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a part-time cop in <LOCATION> Fishkill </LOCATION> who killed himself Dec. 2. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, 28, who lived four blocks from <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, fit the girl's description of a fair-haired man with a mustache He said in his suicide note he was jilted by his girlfriend and failed to get a job as a state trooper. Investigators drew no link to the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case, but <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s advisers accused <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON> of being assailants <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON> has threatened them with a slander suit. A special prosecutor also quit after one day. The state attorney general took over Jan. 26. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s advisers have challenged every official effort to investigate the case. They balked at cooperating because they thought <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, an <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> aide, was n't sensitive enough in civil rights matters. Then they insisted that <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> handle the trial, even though he had little courtroom experience. If <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> ca n't get an impartial state prosecutor, he wants <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> to take over. `` They simply do n't wish to cooperate,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. The governor also warned, `` The trail is getting cold.''

 The Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, the bombastic Pentecostal minister with the <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> hairdo and gift for gab, climbed atop the soap box long before he found the <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case. `` I've been screaming ever since the doctor slapped me at birth,'' said <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, 33, a parishless preacher from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> who wears a <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jr. </ORGANIZATION> medallion on a chain around his beefy neck. `` Silence is not one of my characteristics,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said. `` Anytime somebody tells me I get a lot of attention on my causes, that's a compliment. An activist is supposed to get attention. What am I supposed to be, an activist that kills the limelight on an issue?'' Reports, however, suggest <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> mouths off to more than just the news media. In January, <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> gave information on black leaders, elected officials, organized crime figures and others to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> was also allegedly under investigation for scalping rock concert tickets earmarked for ghetto youth, but has denied any wrongdoing. `` All that was a whole lot of talk. That's all. There's no grand jury. We gave some drug information,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> has directed anti-drug rallies and took to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> subways in December and January to lead the `` days of outrage'' protests against racial injustice in the city. He screeched about racism in <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, where three white teen-agers were convicted of manslaughter last year in the death of a black man they chased onto a highway. Now he is advising the 16-year-old <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, who he says was abducted, raped and sodomized by a group of white men in a small town 70 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Racial epithets were written on her body. On <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>'s advice, she has refused to tell her story beyond a fragmented, almost incoherent interview with police the day she was found. State Assemblyman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, chairman of the Black and <ORGANIZATION> Puerto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, has accused <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> of using `` tactics that encourage race wars.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleminster </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, said it was a travesty <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and his friends had `` refused to let this investigation proceed except on their own terms.'' But <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> says he wants to focus on what he calls a pattern of police and racial abuses. `` Enough is enough. We're going to break it on this case,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said. At age 4, <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> gave his first sermon, a 22-minute piece at a church in the <LOCATION> Bedford-Stuyvesant </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. He was licensed to minister at age 10 and appeared with gospel singer <PERSON> Mahalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> when he was 16. As a 12-year-old, he met <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the late congressman and head of <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Abyssinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` You know, kid, you got to know when to hit it and know when to quit it,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> told him. In 1969, <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> worked with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on boycotts of food stores under `` Operation Breadbasket.'' He says <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told him: `` Turn on the heat, and do n't ever turn it off.'' In 1972, <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> met <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the self-proclaimed godfather of soul music. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> toured with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and reverently copied his wavy hairdo. `` I thought I had seen God when I met <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. When I saw <PERSON> James </PERSON>, I knew I had seen God. <PERSON> James </PERSON> is everything I would think God would be if he was walking around,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Through <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> met boxing promoter <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> at the <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali-George </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> title fight in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> in 1974. King tried to give a check to <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who insisted on cash. King relented and delivered $ 100,000. `` We counted it out on the floor,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said.

 The Utne Reader warned of `` The Coming Crash'' months before the stock market nosedive. It foresaw a wave of activism washing the country weeks before Americans took to the streets to protest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. With a flair for prophecy and a circulation approaching 90,000, more than double the figure of a year ago, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Utne </PERSON>'s 4-year-old digest of the underground and alternative press aims to chronicle the intellectual voice of the Baby Boom generation. `` It's my hope and suspicion that the'90s are going to be far different from the'80s and that people are going to start thinking about social and political issues in a different way,'' said executive editor <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Walljasper </PERSON>, 32. `` I think we'll be right there helping to define and propel that thinking. It's my hope we'll have our finger on the pulse the way <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> did in the 1960s and'70s.'' That's modest compared to Utne's designs. `` I want to change the world,'' said the magazine's 41-year-old namesake and founder. `` That's why I started it. That's the motivation. I want to find out in the process how the world should be. I do n't have a clear agenda. I think there are a lot of voices to be heard.'' Utne, <PERSON> Walljasper </PERSON> and associate editor <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> scan the vast, largely left-of-center landscape of the alternative press and excerpt the best they see in their bimonthly editions. The Reader sells for $ 4 an issue. The editors say they've combed nearly 3,000 magazine titles in search of material. The journals are stacked high in the Reader's office above a gourmet coffee shop Scanned along with familiar opinion magazines such as The Nation and American Spectator are obscure journals like the India-based `` Manushi,'' printed alternately in English and Hindi; the London-based `` New Ground,'' the self-billed `` journal of green socialism''; and `` Daybreak,'' a national magazine by and about <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>. For some magazines, to be excerpted by the Utne Reader is to have their whispers amplified to shouts. Many journals and writers send their published articles to the Reader, <PERSON> Walljasper </PERSON> said. In turn, he said, editors and fans look to the Reader as their line to the alternative press. <PERSON> Walljasper </PERSON> calls the hundreds of special interest, often-eccentric periodicals the intellectual equivalent of the network of radar stations set up on the nation's perimeter to monitor incoming aircraft `` It brings a lot to the attention of people who otherwise would n't get that information,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, communications director of the San Francisco-based <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> magazine. `` A person could n't subscribe to all those magazines excerpted unless they're a fanatic. I like the Utne Reader,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. Added <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, cultural editor of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> newsweekly The Guardian: `` It's sort of a Reader's Digest of progressive writing. I'm glad it's out there.'' The Reader's Digest comparisons are inevitable. The two share the excerpting format. Coincidentally, both were conceived in the Twin Cities, though the late <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> moved his digest from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> long ago. But Reader's Digest, in the middle of the mainstream, has little interest in the kind of articles found on Utne's pages. Recent Reader cover stories include `` In <ORGANIZATION> Search </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meaningful </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ritual </ORGANIZATION> _ On Finding Customs and Ceremonies that Reflect Your Values,'' and `` In Praise of Idleness _ How to Live Well Outside the <LOCATION> Fast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>.'' Conservative and liberal views are often juxtaposed in the Reader, which flanks main pieces with numerous shorter, related stories. <PERSON> Walljasper </PERSON> says the Reader `` does n't preach to the converted the way some publications do.'' Nevertheless, Utne's interests and philosophy come through loudly. New Age and `` holistic'' references abound. Utne, not coincidentally, founded <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Age </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> 14 years ago in his first magazine venture. It lives on without him, printing articles on natural foods, ecological politics and Eastern spirituality. Utne, a participant in the 1960s counterculture during his time at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, has worked as a literary agent in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and as director of new ventures for <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Learning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Eden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prairie </LOCATION>. He describes his politics vaguely, saying he yearns for `` a greener, kinder world.'' Advertising for a managing editor in the first year, Utne listed attributes that more or less match his own: `` a slightly skeptical, ex-radical, hippie, spiritual-type magazine addict who's seen all the movements for personal growth and social change and still has hope for the future.'' His original hope for the magazine has been met and then some, <PERSON> Utne </PERSON> says. The idea was sprung by a direct-mail test that persuaded eight investors to put up the $ 150,000 in seed money; he has not had to go back for more. From the premier issue, a 12-page newsletter issued in February 1984, the Utne Reader has grown to 128 pages in the May-June 1988 issue. In a special report to readers in the latest edition, <PERSON> Utne </PERSON> reports a `` secure, positive cash flow'' that has brought the Reader to the break-even point. He states plans to begin Alternative Press Awards and to form a business and professional association committed to social responsibility. The Utne Reader does n't have to be small and struggling just because it's committed to small, often-struggling publications, <PERSON> Utne </PERSON> said. Reader's Digest, he noted, did n't have a huge Baby Boom audience to nurture its growth the way the Reader has. `` And they're selling 18 million an issue. I figure why should n't we go just as big? In this day and age of media overload, something that does the selecting and integrating job for -LRB- readers -RRB- is really a useful service.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tejas </PERSON> awoke uneasily in the darkness of his snow cave, high on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McKinley </LOCATION>. It was his 20th day climbing the continent's highest peak, and he was the only living soul for miles. But now someone, or something, seemed to be in the cave with him. `` It could have been just the wind,'' the 35-year-old Alaskan recalled. `` But I was pretty convinced right then and there that <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> was in there with me.'' On Feb. 12, 1984, <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Uemura </PERSON> became the first mountaineer to scale Mount McKinley alone in winter. He vanished in a storm on the way down, and some veteran climbers believe the Japanese explorer's spirit still roams the mountain <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> called out `` Good morning!'' in Japanese. The roaring wind outside gave the only reply, and <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> settled back, convinced the spirit was benign. The wind eased the next day, March 7, and <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> climbed to the summit, where he planted a Japanese flag to honor the man who blazed the way for him. Then he did something <PERSON> Uemura </PERSON> failed to do. He came back. <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>, elevation 20,320 feet, is considered <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s ultimate mountaineering challenge. The vertical reach from base camp on the <LOCATION> Kahiltna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Glacier </LOCATION> to the summit is 13,200 feet _ about 2,000 feet greater than the climb up <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION>. Each May and June, hundreds of climbers flock to <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>. Unbearable arctic weather forces more than half to turn back short of the summit. In winter, the unbearable turns unbelievable. Temperatures can dip to minus 58 degrees, and storms rake the mountain with hurricane-force winds. Only four teams have made it to the top in winter since the first expedition in 1967; two of them lost climbers. <PERSON> Uemura </PERSON> was one of two climbers to die in a recent flurry of solo winter attempts. In all, <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>'s slopes are littered with the memories of more than 50 dead climbers. <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> knows all the grim mileposts _ crevassed areas named for climbers they swallowed, a slope dubbed the Autobahn for the many Germans who have fallen there _ and he uses them as warning signs. `` I want to challenge myself to live as fully and completely as possible,'' he said. `` A lot of people will say, ` You're doing something that jeopardizes your ability to live.' But by living on the edge, I can define life a lot easier. It does n't make you love it any less. It makes you love it more.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> returned as something of a local hero. As he sat recently in a sunlit <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> cafe, strangers kept interrupting to congratulate him. They stopped partly because of his accomplishment, partly because <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> is hard to miss. His head, at its lower elevations, is forested by a bushy black beard; the summit is bare, shaved daily except for a neatly braided rattail. <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- pronounced TAY-hoss -RRB- stands 5-foot-8 and has a personality that lives up to his hairstyle. A veteran of 13 successful <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> climbs, most of them as a guide for Genet Expeditions, he bounces boisterous yodels off the bergschrund and readily pulls a fiddle from his pack to scratch out folk tunes. He came to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in 1973, a flatlander from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Within three days, he stood slack-jawed in <LOCATION> Denali </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, watching as clouds unveiled <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>'s towering north face. <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> fell in love. He worked construction jobs and lived in a tent to save money `` to get into climbing big time.'' He first climbed <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> in 1978; the next year he was invited back to guide. In 1986, he led the first successful winter climb of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s second-tallest peak Two months later, back on <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>, he took part in a daring rescue, climbing over the summit ridge and rappelling 600 feet to reach two altitude-sick Korean climbers. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> rangers discourage solo climbs of <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> and tried to dissuade another climber who started up the same day as <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION>. That climber, with no previous arctic experience, was flown out with frostbitten toes after five days. <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> was not warned. `` I think <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> is a very special case,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a mountaineering ranger who lauds <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> as a cautious climber and a meticulous planner. `` With <PERSON> Vern </PERSON>, it was a very calculated risk. He knew what he was getting into.'' Tejas proudly notes he can still count to 20 on his fingers and toes, each digit intact and unfrozen. To prevent slips into crevasses on his solo climb, he strapped a 16-foot extension ladder to his body _ `` my aluminum albatross,'' he calls it. <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> was flown to <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> on Feb. 16 by glacier pilot <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. He carried 170 pounds of gear and enough food for 16 days. But as he packed a toboggan, he decided he had too much. He left behind his tent and 20 pounds of food.

 He never missed the tent. Each night he dug a trench, then covered it with a roof of snow supported by his skis, ladder and other gear. As the temperature outside dipped to 20 degrees below zero, the air inside stayed a comfortable 20 to 30 degrees above. Good thing. <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> was confined to trenches, or to snow caves dug by previous expeditions, for 16 of his 29 days on the mountain. He hid in them from raging storms, eating half rations to conserve food, stuffing in earplugs to sleep while the wind roared like a locomotive. Tejas used precious hours between storms to inch upward. Sometimes, he tossed bamboo wands ahead to gauge the slope in a white landscape made featureless by blowing snow. He reached the top, in a whiteout, on the 21st day. `` I put a Japanese flag on the summit, out of respect for <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON>'s spirit, took a few pictures, and got the heck out of there,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> picked his way down the mountain, finally reaching base camp on the 27th day. He dug in and waited. Two days later, on March 16, the clouds lifted and <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> was flown the 130 miles south to <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, where he stepped into a circle of reporters and the arms of his girlfriend, <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvine </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> said his month on the mountain reinforced his conviction that people are not solitary creatures at heart. It deepened his relationship with <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> and stirred thoughts of his father, to whom he had n't spoken for 19 years. `` The first thing I wanted to do when I got back was call him and tell him I love him,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Unfortunately, he was out of town, but he called me. He'd heard about the climb.'' Tejas seems to have returned from a month of risking death even fuller of life. `` If you take on a challenge that is bigger than you, and you overcome the obstacles in the way, you become a bigger person for it,'' he said. `` You find your own limitations, but you also find your true ability in the process.'' Tejas is still exploring his limitations. Earlier this month, he led a climb in eastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Wrangell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, and he's scheduled to lead two groups up <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> in May <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> had hoped to make last month's climb even more historic by being the first to descend from <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>'s summit hanging from a parasail. The swirling snow foiled that plan, but the parasail is cached near the summit. With a wide grin, <ORGANIZATION> Tejas </ORGANIZATION> said he just might be able to find it.

<HEAD>For Renaissance Specialist, Authenticity Is In the Ear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Though the Tallis Scholars seldom sing anything more recent than the 17th century, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> does n't consider the group to be part of the early music revival. Nor does the young conductor worry very much whether the Scholars mimic the sound of the Renaissance. `` We ca n't possibly guess, and we ca n't possibly know,'' he said during the British group's recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour. `` It's not like digging up an instrument which has been buried, and reanimating it.'' The standard of authenticity, for <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, boils down to what sounds good. `` I hope that is based on how the choirs were constituted, and how it did sound in the 16th century,'' he added. The Scholars are now the busiest exponents of sacred music of the Renaissance, and are doing well enough to sustain their own label, <PERSON> Gimell </PERSON>. Tallis Scholars recordings have a heavily English flavor, with two by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallis </PERSON>, two more featuring the music of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Missa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Tibi </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinitas </PERSON> of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taverner </PERSON>. There is also a single recording of music by the contemporary composer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavener </PERSON>, who was commissioned by the Scholars. However, the group's best seller has been its recording of two masses by <PERSON> Josquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Desprez </PERSON>, a Flemish composer who died in 1521. The performance was honored as record of the year for 1987 by <PERSON> Grammophone </PERSON> magazine. Debates about the performance of ancient music are often heated, and at times extreme. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said he has heard it categorically stated that the music of <LOCATION> Palestrina </LOCATION> was meant to be sung one voice to a part, and that the music of <PERSON> Lassus </PERSON> ideally should have 12 voices per part _ though the two men were contemporaries writing in similar styles. `` Experts tend to have their hobbyhorses, I find,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't afford to get bogged down with these endless details, and not see my way through to a good performance. `` In the end, I am most interested in preserving this beauty of sound, and I will not let dogmatic authenticity get in the way.'' The voice he wants, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> says, is one `` which can sustain a contrapuntal line without distorting the texture, and that requires singing in tune and without very much vibrato.'' The group which toured this country included two basses, two tenors, two countertenors -LRB- male altos -RRB- and four women sopranos. The use of women, rather than boy sopranos, is <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' most obvious departure from the practice of the 16th century. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> argues that `` authentic'' boy sopranos are no longer available, because boys' voices now break at age 12 or 13. In the 16th century, voices broke in the late teens, so the boy soprano of the time would have a riper voice and greater maturity as a musician. Furthermore, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said it is likely that women were used in some Renaissance music, such as <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s later works for the private chapels of Roman Catholic families. Whether that music was for one voice or two voices per part, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said, `` was very much a question of how many people turned up for service.'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 35, was never a choirboy _ `` my parents did not think of it, they are n't musical'' _ but he became interested in Renaissance music as an undergraduate at <ORGANIZATION> Winchester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. He won an organ scholarship at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, where he claims to have been a very indifferent performer. In the early 1970s, he came under the spell of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wulstan </PERSON>'s choral group, the Clerkes of <LOCATION> Oxenford </LOCATION>, which was founded in the 1960s and used women The Tallis Scholars were found in 1973, and became a fully professional group in 1978. The Scholars are the only group recorded by <PERSON> Gimell </PERSON>, the Oxford-based label which <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> founded in partnership with <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> after cutting two records for <ORGANIZATION> EMI </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was obvious they were n't particularly interested,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. `` They wanted a money-spinner.'' With his own label, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> has been able to record the music of composers such as <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON> non Papa, who is obscure even within the small world of early music. <PERSON> Gimell </PERSON> will soon release what is apparently the first recording of music of Sarum chant, the liturgical music of medieval <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Florida Has Most Widespread Selling of False Immigration Documents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Fraud, confusion and, for thousands, new rejection have dogged the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration amnesty program in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, particularly for <LOCATION> Haitian </LOCATION> aliens who have for years charged unfair treatment by the federal government. `` There's a general perception that they get treated differently from the other groups,'' said attorney <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lux </PERSON>, director of a Lutheran Ministries program that helps aliens in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s `` Little <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'' neighborhood. `` These are simple people. They do n't know who to trust. But they are hungry to be <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. citizens.'' He had just spent 30 minutes explaining to an upset young woman, with her male friend translating into <PERSON> Creole </PERSON>, why the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had rejected her application for amnesty. He asked who had prepared her application and was told a notary public. <PERSON> Lux </PERSON> rolled his eyes. `` These notaries public just take their money and they do n't know what they're doing,'' he said, then explained to the woman that she could appeal and file a new application with more documentation Lack of documentation has been a major problem for the aliens, many of them poorly educated. Most have been living underground, using aliases and trying to avoid the INS. The selling and presentation of false documents has been more prevalent in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> than any other state, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> says. Some 20 percent of the nearly 100,000 applications filed in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> were recommended for denial, District Director <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said. Nationwide, about 95 percent have been approved. The biggest problem has been with farmworkers, who rarely have payroll records because they are paid in cash. At the program's beginning, farm contractors sold false payroll records, with prices reportedly ranging from $ 25 to $ 2,500 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office said last week it would discontinue Operation Cucumber, which resulted in 61 fraud indictments against farmworkers and employers but was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the courts. While non-farmworker aliens must provide documents proving they have lived continuously in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since before Jan. 1, 1982, the requirements for farmworkers were much looser to ensure a plentiful labor supply for the nation's growers. They need only prove they worked 90 days picking crops in the year ending May 1, 1986. Their application deadline is Nov. 30, 1988. Haitians in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, estimated to number at least 200,000, have long complained their treatment has been unfair. While Cubans who left their Communist homeland have usually been welcomed with open arms, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has battled in court to uphold its view that Haitians are economic, not political, refugees. Since 1981, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has patrolled off <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, intercepting boatloads of would-be immigrants. However, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has included Haitians already on record with the agency in a special class called Cuban-Haitian Entrants dealing with huge influxes of Cubans and Haitians in 1980-81. <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said more than 40,000 Haitians have been granted residency in that class. But Haitians applying under the amnesty program sometimes do n't understand, or ca n't obtain, the required proof of residency and employment `` I understand their feelings,'' <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said. `` But I do n't know how you can approve anything without some proof We've got to abide by the law, which has certain requirements.'' The Haitian <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> have stopped helping with new applications. <PERSON> Lux </PERSON> said such organizations, along with the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, are barely keeping up with applications and lack the resources to handle appeals. The Haitian advocates say the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> processors have become overly skeptical because of the fraud cases. `` There are some crooks, but we should n't penalize the majority because of a minority,'' said <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean-Juste </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a lot of headaches. To the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers, I say: ` Be generous. We are Americans, too.'''

<TEXT>
 You really do n't need to know much about investing to make a buck in the market these days. Not that it's easy. You do need a few hundred million dollars, quick access to information, a good computer program and a willingness to push the buy or sell button. Given all that, you have a chance at another fortune. Your activities have almost nothing to do with understanding the companies whose shares you buy or sell, or of assessing their fundamental values, or measuring their management or determining if they can remain competitive. Your purpose as a program trader is not so much to invest in the potential earnings of corporations as it is to use the marketplace as a tool. While you need not understand companies, you must understand how to work the market. Your focus is not just short-term in the usual sense of the word, which might mean a few months, but brief-term in the sense that you deal with tiny price variations that might come and go in a matter of minutes. Some critics say the various program trading techniques are but a step away from manipulation. They say the public, sensing this, will stay away from stocks, just as reasonable humans and animals stay clear of the elephant herd. In recent days, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, former head of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, said such actdivities should be outlawed, and former Attorney General <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzenbach </PERSON> suggested the public may come to view the market as controlled rather than free. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is upset. Much of Wall Street is also disturbed, and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> has won approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to curtail program trading whenever the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average moves 50 points in a day. Much of the concern relates to extreme volatility that critics attribute to program trading, which often kicks in automatically when certain criteria are reached, thus exacerbating what otherwise might be minor price changes. Program trading was among practices cited in the collapse of Oct. 19 and in the 100-point-plus selloff in a few hours last week. Not only is it associated with big moves, rightly or wrongly, but with reversals as well. Institutions with computers, trading power, information and programs can make quick money on volatility. But volatility contradicts one of the basic promises of organized marketplaces, that is, an orderly flow of transactions. A loss of confidence in organized markets is deadly. Reduce confidence and you reduce participation. Reduce participation and it means smaller commissions and maybe lower prices, too. Evidence of lowered confidence abounds today, measured by such things as unstable prices, money left on the sidelines rather than committed to stocks, and shrunken price-earnings ratios. <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> points out that the price-earnings multiple _ the number of times earnings at which stocks sell _ is now down to about 13 times 1988 earnings for the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock index Last summer it was 20. This and other evidence undoubtedly was considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> when it cited `` the fragile nature of public confidence'' in approving the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s limitations on program trading

 <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday strong performances in its chemicals and fiber glass businesses and favorable currency exchange rates helped first-quarter earnings rise 36.5 percent from the same period last year. Net earnings were $ 118.6 million, or $ 1.07 per share, on sales of $ 1.37 billion, compared to $ 86.9 million, or 73 cents per share, on $ 1.26 billion in sales a year earlier. `` One result of our strategic emphasis on globalization and value-added diversification is that lower North American auto production and housing starts did not impede <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to achieve substantial growth,'' Chairman <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarni </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION> said its glass business benefitted from strong gains in the European auto and construction markets and worldwide demand for continuous strand fiber glass. Sales of new car coatings rose significantly in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and chemicals sales were considerably higher although PPG divested units that had 1987 first-quarter sales of $ 37 million.

 The federal government ran up a $ 29.1 billion budget deficit in March, but imbalance for the first six months of the fiscal year was 3.5 percent less than the same period last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. The March deficit topped a $ 23.9 billion shortfall in February. Commenting on Thursday's announcement, analysts said the budget imbalance is usually higher in March than in other months because because people who owe taxes for 1987 generally wait until April to pay, while those due a refund normally file early.

 Home diaper delivery service is bottoming out in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, in what some industry watchers say is another sign of the nationwide hard times facing an old-fashioned product. Damaged by the growth of disposable diapers, Dy-Dee <ORGANIZATION> Diaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westmont </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, dropped its home-delivery service early this month after almost 50 years and has laid off about 20 percent of its workforce. Dy-Dee's longtime competitor, Dy-Dee Service of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, absorbed a few hundred customers, saw its local sales rise by 14 percent and is `` not hurting at all,'' says general manager <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilkington </PERSON>. But 12 other such services have dried up locally over the past 20 years. Nationally, the numbers have dropped by more than half to about 200 during that time, according to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiffert </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Industry analysts estimate that disposables now account for up to 90 percent of all diapers used, although <PERSON> Shiffert </PERSON> puts the figure at 60 percent to 70 percent. He also contends that as many babies, up to 800,000 nationwide, wear delivered cloth diapers as they did 20 years ago. <PERSON> Shiffert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Odd </PERSON> <PERSON> Knutstad </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Westmont </ORGANIZATION> company, blame the intense, 20-year advertising campaign by disposable diaper manufacturers for the demise of home delivery. `` By the time the baby is born, the woman has seen the ad hundreds and hundreds of times for Pampers, and is seduced by them. Her husband also,'' <PERSON> Knutstad </PERSON> said. `` We sent them literature, we called, but most people said, ` I've already made up my mind. I'm going to take disposables like I've seen on TV.''' Diaper delivery services began declining drastically in the mid-1960s, when <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the first companies to manufacture disposable diapers, stepped up its advertising nationwide, <PERSON> Shiffert </PERSON> said. `` Disposable diapers before then were looked upon as temporary things for travel,'' he said. As a result of the blitz, many family-owned diaper businesses failed or were bought by larger companies, <PERSON> Shiffert </PERSON> said. In 1987, combined sales of Luvs and Pampers brands amounted to nearly 16 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 17 billion in revenue. <PERSON> Knutstad </PERSON> also blamed the growth of disposables on working mothers, who have are not at home to receive solicitations from delivery services. But peers in the business believe working mothers will be the factor that turns the industry around. For example, <PERSON> Pilkington </PERSON> said two-career couples want the convenience of a diaper service and can afford it. Disposables cost at least $ 11 a box a week while Dy-Dee Service charges $ 12.25 for 90 diapers a week. <PERSON> Pilkington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shiffert </PERSON> also think mounting trash disposal problems will ultimately restrict the use of disposable products. Ecologically-minded people already use diaper services, they said. <ORGANIZATION> Dy-Dee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> predicts it will expand deliveries beyond its current 4,000 households. The company, a division of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Piscataway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, operates 18 growing diaper-delivery services nationwide, <PERSON> Pilkington </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Knutstad </PERSON> also foresees an improving market but said it will not develop soon enough for the <ORGANIZATION> Westmont </ORGANIZATION> firm. The company will concentrate on accounts with nursing homes and diversify its services for at least five years, when it might again target homes.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings over the rest of 1988 should improve from their first-quarter performance, despite an expected slowing of auto sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, industry analysts predict. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s first-quarter earnings rose 18.4 percent against a year ago, due primarily to an accounting change, while its operating income fell 4.3 percent, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The nation's largest automaker said it earned $ 1.09 billion, or $ 3.11 a share, on sales of $ 26.4 billion in the first quarter. In first-quarter 1987, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 922.5 million, or $ 2.62 a share, on sales of $ 26.1 billion. Without the accounting change, which boosted <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> net income by $ 224.2 million, first-quarter earnings would have been 5.9 percent lower than a year earlier at $ 868 million, or $ 2.41 a share. The automaker's operating earnings fell 4.3 percent to $ 657.6 million in the first quarter from $ 687.4 million a year ago, the result of production cutbacks, the costs of buyer incentives and increased labor costs, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide vehicle sales were down 5.2 percent from first-quarter 1987. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales account for about 61 percent of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide vehicle sales <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of American-made cars and trucks to dealers fell nearly 16 percent against the first three months of 1987 as dealers balanced their inventories. But on the retail side, dealers' sales of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> vehicles including imports rose 12 percent on cars against a year ago and 24 percent on trucks. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>, industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, predicted <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s sales and earnings would improve in later quarters due to boosts in vehicle production and to the first-quarter clean-out of dealer inventories. `` They're scheduling a lot more production of cars and trucks in the second quarter so they could earn even twice as much as in the first quarter,'' if the one-time accounting change is excluded, <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Agoura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said he expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto sales to slow in the second quarter, delaying improvement in <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> earnings until later in the year. But <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings will benefit from further cost cuts in the second quarter, <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> would not provide figures for earnings or losses on <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaking business. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> earned only a nominal profit on its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vehicle business for all of 1987. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> had reported earnings rose for two of its subsidiaries, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, but fell for its finance subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acceptance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> because of cut-rate loans to consumers and fewer auto sales. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it made improvements in manufacturing efficiency and engineering, but the gains were not enough to offset lower sales, <ORGANIZATION> GMAC </ORGANIZATION>'s lower earnings and cost increases that included wage increases under a new labor contract. `` We're going to continue to cut costs and improve the efficiency of our plants and the quality of our products,'' the company said in a statement attributed to <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON>. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> trimmed $ 3.7 billion from its costs under the first phase of a four-year plan that calls for $ 4 billion in cost cuts in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it cut $ 1.3 billion from its costs in first-quarter 1988.

 The head of software giant <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> vaulted past <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> last year as the nation's highest-paid boss, according to a list compiled by Business Week. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzi </PERSON>, the 36-year-old chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>, made $ 26.3 million in salary, bonuses and stock options during 1987, topping the $ 17.9 million taken home by <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, who had been the top-paid executive of 1986, the magazine said Thursday. Figures were compiled for the annual `` Executive Compensation Scoreboard'' being published in Business Week's May 2 edition. The list, which covers 339 companies, shows that with long-term compensation the average chief executive's total pay jumped 48 percent in 1987 to $ 1.8 million, one of the largest single increases ever. Business Week attributed the gains largely to stock options that were exercised prior to the Oct. 19 market crash. Excluding long-term pay, the average chief executive's salary and bonus rose 8 percent to $ 975,617, much less than the 18 percent average increase in 1986 and slightly below the 8.6 percent that most managers settled for, the magazine said. The third-highest paid executive was <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fireman </PERSON>, chairman of running shoe company <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, who collected a total of $ 15.4 million.

No 4, President <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>, collected $ 14.3 million, while No. 6, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, senior vice president, collected $ 13.2 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it net income soared in the first quarter, but most of the gains were proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations, the company said Thursday. The transportation and natural resources company reported net income of $ 343 million, or $ 2.18 a share, for the first three months of 1988, compared with $ 45.9 million, or 29 cents a share, for the same period a year ago. Excluding a gain of about $ 324 million from the sale of its <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> timber operations, some of its pipelines and its leasing subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION>'s net income for the quarter declined to $ 18.7 million from $ 38.8 million. Revenue for the quarter totaled nearly $ 1.36 billion compared with $ 1.23 billion a year earlier. `` The lower net result is no surprise, as it reflects anticipated non-recurring expenses of approximately $ 30 million incurred in connection with our restructuring program and a $ 57 million increase in interest expense,'' <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krebs </PERSON> stated. The interest expense resulted from the company's borrowing of $ 3.7 billion and issuing of $ 780 million in debt securities to make a $ 30-a-share payment to stockholders as part of its restructuring plan, <PERSON> Krebs </PERSON> said. Operating income increased 57 percent to $ 153.1 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says it no longer is considering selling the entire company as a defense against a $ 1.7 billion hostile takeover bid launched by <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON>. But talks are continuing with unidentified third parties about possibly selling parts of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' chemicals and construction materials and services divisions, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filing made availale on Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON> said March 27 that discussions were being held with unidentified third parties about selling the entire company to keep it out of <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s hands. A group led by <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> and the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is offering $ 60 per share for <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Bonds Fall On Inflation Fears; Stocks Mixed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 5 grafs to UPDATE with durable goods orders for
March; uppicks 2nd graf pvs: The yield...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Gains in orders for `` big ticket'' durable goods in March were offset by a drop in orders for military hardware, leaving the overall balance virtually unchanged, the government said today. Total orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, amounted to a seasonally adjusted $ 114.3 billion last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. That was a tiny $ 53 million rise and followed a slight 0.1 percent increase in February and a sharp 1.2 percent drop in January. While economists had been expecting a substantial increase in March orders, the February number represented a sharp upward revision from a previous estimate of a 1.1 percent drop. The report came as interest rates in bond market continued to rise amid concerns that inflation is heating up again. The yield of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond rose to 9.03 percent by late Thursday from 9.00 percent in the previous session. The bond's yield rises when its price falls. Analysts also said the bond market took a dim view of the government's report that it ran up a $ 29.1 billion budget deficit in March, up from a $ 23.9 billion shortfall in February. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the market had expected the deficit to decline by $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion in March instead of rising. Big deficits mean heavy government borrowing, which tends to push interest rates _ the cost of borrowing _ higher as competition for funds increases. Oil futures prices, one indicator of potential inflation trends, moved higher Thursday after a two-day retreat. Contracts for June delivery of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, closed up 38 cents at $ 18.36 per barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said the credit markets showed no reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s report that its three measures of the nation's money supply rose in early April On Wall Street, a sharp afternoon selloff wiped out early gains to leave the stock market little changed from Wednesday's close. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up by more than 30 points at mid-session but finished the day up just 1.99 at 1,987.40.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said today the dial-a-porn industry is widespread and largely ignores statutes designed to prevent its access to children. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said fines of $ 600,000 each imposed Thursday against two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> companies were based on their transmission of some `` very rough material'' over the phone to customers. `` The problem is very widespread,'' he said, `` not only in terms of so-called dial-a-porn service providers but what appears to be a widespread disregard of the statutory requirements as well as the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s regulatory requirements.'' <ORGANIZATION> Audio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intercambio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> both used tape recordings that were changed daily to attract callers who were then billed for the calls, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said. Similar services are advertised in sex-oriented magazines and newspapers across the country. The companies were found in violation of regulations designed to prevent access of obscene material to minors or transmission of such material across state lines. Audio Enterprises and <PERSON> Intercambio </PERSON> denied the material they used was obscene and said they did not have the capacity to screen calls. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, interviewed on `` CBS This Morning'', said both of the companies admitted they had made no effort to ensure that only consenting adults made the calls. He said telephone company liability is not at issue under the statutes. He said on Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T collected $ 5.5 million from calls made to one <ORGANIZATION> Audio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> line, of which $ 650,000 went to Audio Enterprises. The use of access codes, message scrambling or credit card numbers are required by FCC rules, but <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said this is widely disregarded. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said the commission had no difficulty determining that material available through the two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> companies was obscene by federal standards. He said he sees no problem with the First Amendment which guarantees freedom of speech. `` After all, the First Amendment does not protect obscenity,'' he said. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> generally supports legislative efforts to outlaw dial-a-porn. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this week gave final approval to an education bill containing a sweeping provision to ban all dial-a-porn and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is expected to sign it. But legal experts said it was probably unconstitutional. Thursday's fines followed an investigation triggered by complaints alleging that access to the sexually explicit messages caused the molestation of a 10-year-old girl and so disturbed a 16-year-old boy that he had to have psychiatric therapy.

 The stock market headed higher today with a boost from declining interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.77 to 2,000.17 in the first half hour of trading.

<HEAD>`Golden Parachutes' Turn to Lead for Some, Job-Search Expert Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is off today.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The generous severance plans called `` golden parachutes'' can turn to lead weights for some fired executives, lulling them into complacency when they should be out looking for work, says the president of a large job-placement firm. `` They get seduced by the money. The golden parachute is totally destructive of people,'' said <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Challenger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Challenger </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Christmas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Golden parachutes are designed to soften the landing of corporate executives booted from office in takeover fights But Challenger, whose company has counseled more than 20,000 displaced workers over the last 25 years, said there are cases where the parachutes provide such a plush cushion the recipients can not seem to get on their feet again. `` I think it's a terrible thing to happen to people,'' he said. `` To me, money does n't buy happiness. People have to work, they have to like what they're doing.'' Challenger said golden parachutes, typically consisting of a lump sum equal to two to three years' salary, foster illusions of financial security and keep recipients from aggressively seeking new jobs. `` The job search is or should be a full-time job in itself until employment is gained,'' Challenger said. `` The longer the individual takes, the less he or she is likely to apply themselves to the search.'' In addition, he said, a job application showing an extended period of unemployment _ regardless of the reason _ may raise questions about motivation in the mind of a prospective employer. Not all consultants agree. For most executives who receive golden parachutes, the money is a bridge between the old job and the next one, or between the old job and retirement, said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassick </PERSON>, a partner in the compensation-consulting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Hewitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lincolnshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` We're talking about people who make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year,'' he said. `` It's not as simple as picking up the want ads and finding a job.'' <PERSON> Bassick </PERSON> suggested Challenger's real beef might be that job-seekers with lots of money in the bank can afford to be picky, making them difficult to place. But Challenger said that his company collects its fees from the job seeker's old employer and that his opposition to golden parachutes is altruistic, not economic. `` I'm opposed to anything that ruins a person's life,'' he said. Recipients of some of the most famous golden parachutes do not appear to have abandoned their careers for the lifestyle of the independently wealthy. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Haselton </PERSON>, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, drew about $ 12 million in compensation, stock payments and a cash settlement _ the golden parachute _ from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regis </ORGANIZATION> when it was bought by <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. But he stayed on as Champion's vice chairman. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, the former head of <ORGANIZATION> Esmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, got a $ 2.7 million compensation package in 1984 when <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> acquired the company. Two years later, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> joined the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> in taking <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> private in a record $ 6.2 billion leveraged buyout. As a followup to that deal, <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> spun off <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, which is now being acquired by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 2.7 billion deal. This time, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s compensation reportedly includes a $ 2.5 million parachute. But multimillion-dollar packages represent the high end of executive severance plans, Challenger said. The golden-parachute concept has spread to smaller companies where top executives earn less than $ 100,000 a year. At that level, severance pay is not enough to retire on, but it is enough to get lazy on, he said. Challenger would not provide names, but cited the case of a former real-estate company executive whose golden parachute included some lucrative property holdings. `` This man can go around and look at his properties and say he's managing them, but he really is n't managing them,'' Challenger said `` This man is in his early 40s. He ca n't spend his years doing this.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> late Thursday rejected a $ 1.22 billion takeover offer from rival bidders whose buyout proposal included splitting the textile giant's assets among them. Sources said a special committee of outside directors on <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' board informed fabric maker <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> that their joint $ 68.50-a-share bid was unacceptable. The directors' objections focused on the length of time the group's offer would be extended as well as whether Odyssey would have been able to get financing to purchase its share of assets, which sources said were valued at about $ 530 million. Because the offer was conditioned upon Odyssey's purchase of assets, `` that raised the uncertainty'' that disturbed the board, said one source close to the transaction. Sources also said that under the proposal, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> could have extended its offer beyond the 10 business days' extension required by <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> rules. The board committee asked that the conditions be eliminated, according to one source who added, `` now the ball's in their court.'' Among the assets Odyssey would purchase were <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' `` greige goods,'' or unfinished textile operations. The division sells about $ 235 million a year in unfinished fabrics and yarn. Odyssey's outstanding a $ 68.50-a-share tender offer, which has been recommended by the <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> board, is set to expire at midnight EDT Tuesday, the same day <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s competing $ 67-a-share tender offer is set to expire. The two companies, which had bid against each other three times in a heated auction, announced earlier in the week that they were negotiating about making a joint bid for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> for $ 68.50 a share in cash. Separately, the attorneys general of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> agreed to issue subpoenas Thursday to <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bibb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has signed an agreement with <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> to purchase certain <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> assets. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> <PERSON> Medlock </PERSON> said he was concerned the three companies, in combining their efforts to acquire <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, may have engaged in `` bid-rigging,'' a violation of antitrust laws, in determining what price to pay for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> stock. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> said today that the company has `` not been accused of any -LRB- antitrust -RRB- violations, and we are confident everything we have done is in accord with all applicable laws.'' The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, textile company is making its bid for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION> NTC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of textile manufacturer <PERSON> Bibb </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> has received <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> permission to sell half of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet lines to <ORGANIZATION> NTC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 170 million. Bidding for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> began after it received a leveraged buyout offer earlier this year from a group led by its own senior management, including Chairman <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a fifth-generation member of the family that founded the company in 1813. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> launched a $ 62.50-a-share tender offer last month after <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> agreed to a buyout by Odyssey at $ 61.50 a share. Odyssey subsequently sweetened its offer to $ 64. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> increased its tender offer to $ 67 a share, but <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> topped that by $ 1.50 a share just hours later.

 A congressional panel has subpoenaed the head of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s junk bond business to testify as part of its investigation of the firm and the financial markets, sources say. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, whose operations have come under scrutiny in the Wall Street insider trading scandal, was ordered Thursday to testify April 27 before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on oversight and investigations, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, already was scheduled to testify next Thursday, but a subpoena was not considered necessary in his case, one source said. `` <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> did not want to appear,'' the source said, and the subcommittee, chaired by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., decided to subpoena him It was not clear immediately whether <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> actually would testify. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, the attorney at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> office who sources said received the subpoena for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, was not in his office late Thursday and queries were directed to <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON>, the firm's spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Asked about the subpoena, <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said, `` We can confirm that we expect hearings next week.'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s operations have been the subject of a broad government inquiry because of the firm's reported past business links with speculator and inside-trader <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who is serving a three-year prison term for securities fraud. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> repeatedly has denied any improper activities and neither the firm nor <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> have been charged with any wrongdoing. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> was the architect of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s pioneering Beverly Hills-based business in high-yield junk bonds, which in past years frequently were used to help finance corporate takeovers like those in which <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> speculated.

Under the new plan, the company would merge with a new entity controlled by <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who already owns 77 percent of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s 30 million outstanding shares. Upon the merger, public shareholders other than <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> would receive for each share a combination of $ 20 in cash and $ 29 in face amount of notes paying 12 percent interest due in 2008.

<TEXT>
 Dig in your pocket or purse, fish out a handful of coins and ask yourself the question: Should the design of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, and half dollars be changed? A campaign is gathering steam in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to do exactly that. Advocates for change say the nation's coins should reflect the nation's present, not its past. And they claim that minting new coins would raise an estimated $ 2.3 billion for the government's deficit-plagued coffers over six years That's no small change. But the figure is disputed. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mint </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today that redesigning the nation's coins would likely raise a few million dollars in profits, but not billions. She estimated that the difference between production costs and the face value of the coins would bring in about $ 2.2 million a year and that an additional $ 3 million in annual profits can be expected from sales of proof sets of the coins to collectors. Yet, she said that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> finds `` generally nothing objectionable'' in the proposal. The sparkplug behind the coin-redesign campaign is <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, which has endorsed the redesign plan. Making her case to the banking committee, Ms. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said that it is important to improve the design of the nation's coinage because, `` not only do our coins tell people in faraway lands something about us and our heroes, ideals, dreams and celebrations; they also speak to the ages.'' Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s consumer affairs and coinage subcommittee, says the record shows that chances of making billions of dollars from a redesign of the nation's coins are remote at The legislation would retain the presidents who currently grace the fronts of those coins, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> on the penny, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> on the nickel, <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> on the dime, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on the quarter and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on the half dollar. But it would permit different portraits to be used, and the tails of the coins would be changed completely. The legislation dictates that the reverse of the quarter carry for a two-year period a design commemorating the bicentennial of the Constitution. Other elements of the design would be selected and approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, perhaps after a national competition by leading artists. Miss <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> says the newly minted coins could be rattling into cash registers by 1989 if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acts quickly this year. `` Aesthetically, the coinage really needs a redesign,'' she said in an interview. `` This is the longest time we have gone without permanent changes on our coinage,'' she said. `` The head of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> on the penny is 79 years old. The tail was last designed in 1959. The quarter is 56 years old. The nickel was last designed in 1938. The dime was last designed in 1946.'' According to Miss <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> the new coins would be identical in size, shape and color to present pocket change. `` There's no real opposition,'' Miss <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` Everyone is gung ho on it. There are no negatives to this. We can make billions to reduce the deficit without raising taxes.'' No opposition? That's not quite the case. <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> has expressed reservations, especially about the proposition that changing the design of coins raises billions. Miss <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> argues that since it costs the Mint just 2 -LCB- cents to produce a single coin, it can issue them for face value, making money on every coin but the penny. She says much more money would pour in from collectors who would rush to buy proof and uncirculated sets of the new coins. But <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that there have been six coin design changes over the past 42 years and none supports the theory that when coins change their faces the money rolls in. `` In fact, some of the changes showed a decline in mintages,'' he said. `` Those claiming that design changes will generate billions of dollars in revenues base those claims on assumptions that have no connection with fact or reality. `` Indeed, the evidence suggests that the effect that coin design changes has on coin demand is so small as to be impossible to measure. It is negligible at best.'' In any case, <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> said the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> has the authority to change the design of coins without approval by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We should reject attempts to respond to the siren's song of easy revenue through coin design changes,'' <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> said. `` There are no profits to be made.'' What about people who are comfortable with the coin designs as they are and want no changes? `` That might be the first impression of some people,'' Miss <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. But she said good new designs would convert them. After all, she said, the classic buffalo nickel went the way of the beast it depicted. And so did the old Mercury dime. `` Coins really reflect how we feel about ourselves as a people; coins should reflect our times,'' she said. `` And the coinage we have just does n't.''

<HEAD>Ashland Earnings Rise Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHLAND, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported dramatically higher earnings in its fiscal second quarter, mostly due to strong performance in the company's non-oil divisions. The company, a major refiner, said Friday it earned $ 21 million, or 74 cents per share in the three months ended March 31, compared with $ 1 million, or 2 cents a share, in the same period last year. Quarterly revenue totaled $ 1.9 billion, vs. $ 1.6 billion in the 1987 period. The sharp rise was led by `` outstanding results'' from <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the company's coal divisions and <ORGANIZATION> SuperAmerica </ORGANIZATION> convenience stores, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, the company's chairman, in a report issued Thursday. Hall also credited <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which reported $ 5 million in operating income, compared with a $ 35 million operating loss in the 1987 quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> had a record $ 28 million in operating income for the qurater, with improvements in all product areas, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` <ORGANIZATION> SuperAmerica </ORGANIZATION> had an excellent quarter with $ 11 million in operating income,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` Operating and equity income from coal interests totaled $ 21 million, as <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Arch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mineral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had record second-quarter results.'' For the six-month period, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 92 million, or $ 3.26 per share, on sales of $ 3.9 billion, compared with 1987 first-half profit of $ 28 million, or 86 cents per share, on $ 3.2 billion in revenue. The latest six-month earnings were favorably affected by an accounting change which added $ 31 million, or $ 1.11 per share to the figures. The company has continued its cooperation with state and federal agencies investigating the Jan. 2 collapse of an <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> storage tank near <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. Damage caused by the tank collapse and spill of about 1 million gallons of oil into the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> rivers will be covered by insurance, subject to a $ 2.5 million deductible, he said. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said the second-quarter results included a charge for the deductible and unspecified charges not covered by insurance.

Sarokin polling jurors and again rejecting request for mistrial.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANDREA HAMILTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorneys for three tobacco companies today unsuccessfully sought a mistrial in a major cigarette liability case, arguing the judge's criticim of the industry and publicity about his statements may have tainted the jury. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON>, acting Thursday on the companies' request to have the case thrown out, said there was enough evidence of a cover-up by the tobacco industry that a jury should decide the suit. However, he did dismiss some of the complaints against the companies _ <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. This morning, <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> rejected the companies' request for a mistrial. He upheld his ruling after polling the jurors individually in private and discovering they did not know of Thursday's finding. In his sometimes scathing opinion, <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> wrote, `` The evidence presented ... permits the jury to find a tobacco industry conspiracy, vast in its scope, devious in its purpose and devastating in its results.'' The suit by <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION> alleges that the companies were responsible for the lung cancer death of his wife, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, who died at age 58 in 1984 after smoking for 40 years. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION>, on Thursday took exception to the tone of <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON>'s opinion. `` I do think there were flourishes there from the judge's pen that went beyond the plaintiff's evidence,'' he said. <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> dismissed claims that the three companies caused Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s cancer by not marketing a safer cigarette and by not conducting adequate research into the health effects of smoking. The suit has been on trial since Feb. 1, and <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s lawyers have rested their case, which they tout as groundbreaking because for the first time a plaintiff's lawyers obtained access to confidential files of tobacco companies and trade groups detailing their public relations strategies. In his 33-page opinion, <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> wrote that the evidence indicated the companies conspired to conceal and misrepresent information on the dangers of smoking and to `` refute, undermine and neutralize information coming from the scientific and medical community.'' The judge said the evidence also indicated the companies tried to `` confuse and mislead the consuming public in an effort to encourage existing smokers to continue and new persons to commence smoking.'' `` The jury may reasonably conclude that defendants were members of and engaged in that conspiracy with full knowledge and disregard for the illness and death it would cause, and that Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> was merely one of its victims,'' <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> said. Rejecting the defense request to dismiss all claims, he wrote, `` If the jury accepts the plaintiff's version of the facts as to the conduct of the defendants, it is difficult to envision a more compelling case for an award of punitive damages.'' Despite the criticism of the tobacco companies, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said he believed <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s case was gutted by <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON>'s opinion. `` The conspiracy claim is very tenuous at best,'' he said. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s attorneys denied the claims dismissed by the judge went to the heart of their case. `` I think the judge was moved by the evidence. It's powerful evidence,'' said attorney <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON>. Attorney <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> denied that her side suffered a critical blow when the judge ruled the plaintiff could not prove Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> would have smoked a safer cigarette if the companies had marketed one. Referring to evidence that the companies knew how to produce a safer cigarette but chose not to, she said, `` We thought it was an important theme, not so much for this case but for the broader implications in future cases.'' <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> also dismissed a claim that Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s death was caused in part by the companies' failure to do enough research on the dangers of smoking. While there was ample evidence that the research was inadequate, the judge said, <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s attorneys did not prove that this directly harmed Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>. A third claim, that the companies failed to warn smokers of the dangers of cigarettes, was dismissed against <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> smoked only <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> cigarettes before 1966, when federally mandated warnings on cigarette packs were required. He said there is evidence `` from which the jury could infer that, prior to 1966, ordinary consumers were not adequately informed of the health risks of smoking,'' he said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearney </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>, said the company was `` confident we will prevail on the basis of evidence that comes out during our presentation.''

<HEAD>Norway To Continue Restraining Oil Output Second Half Of 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> said Friday that it would continue restraining its oil output by 7.5 percent of actual production during the second half of 1988. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> is not a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> but it has supported <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s effort to curb production to help stabilize worldwide oil prices since February 1986. `` The effort will continue on the condition that other exporting countries carry out realistic regulation efforts to stabilize oil prices at a reasonably high level,'' <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s Oil and <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The ruling was made by the cabinet and does not need approval by the parliament. Since no new oil fields are scheduled to open in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> during the year's second half, the decision means the nation will restrain its total production capacity of 1.06 million barrels a day by about 85,000 barrels. <PERSON> Egil </PERSON> <PERSON> Helle </PERSON>, a ministry spokesman, acknowledged a connection between the decision and the April 26 meeting between <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and at least seven non-OPEC oil producers. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> will not officially attend the meeting, although it will send an observer. `` We have had many questions from outside <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> in connection with the meeting and our attitude toward a stable oil market,'' <PERSON> Helle </PERSON> said, explaining the reason for his announcement. A senior oil ministry official said last week <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> would be willing to consider further restraints if production cuts are agreed on at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> meeting.

<HEAD>Head of Crash Study Blames Japanese Selling of U.S. Bonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of a presidential panel that investigated the October stock market crash says massive selling of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds by Japanese investors incited the plunge, the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, co-chairman of the investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, also claims the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> injected more than $ 10 billion into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial system in the days after the crash, the Journal said. Federal Reserve officials said they could not comment. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was quoted as making the assertions at a meeting of institutional investors and money managers Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He was traveling Friday and his secretary said he was unreachable. His reported remarks were considered significant not only because <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> led the panel that investigated the crash, but also because of his possible future role as a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary if Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wins the presidential election. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> confidant. `` People ask me: What was it that blew it off on the 19th of October _ was it the twin -LRB- trade and budget -RRB- deficits, was it the <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> -LRB- tax -RRB- legislation, what was it?,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` I do n't think it was any of those things that really was the trigger,'' he was quoted as saying. `` The real trigger was -LRB- that -RRB- the Japanese came in for their own reasons and sold an enormous amount of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government bonds, and drove the 30-year government -LRB- bond -RRB- up through 10 percent. And when it got through 10 percent, that got a lot of people thinking, ` Gee, that's four times the return you get on equity. Here we go, inflation again.''' The Brady panel's crash report, released in January, said the weakening dollar and higher interest rates were key elements in the uncertainty that helped cause the crash. But his reported remarks Thursday marked the first time Japanese holders of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bonds were specifically mentioned as the catalyst. It was n't clear from the Journal account whether <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> had changed or amended his views after the study was done. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> also was quoted as expressing frustration with the progress of post-crash changes in market regulation, particularly the apparent jurisdictional fight between the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which watches stock trading, and the <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which watches stock-index futures and options activity. He also was quoted as warning that if the market crashes again, `` punitive'' legislation would result.

 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed lower Friday in light dealing as buying interest dwindled to a standstill at the end of the latest settlement period for stock trading. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down 20.3 points, or 1.13 percent, at 1,771.6.

Other than the book-squaring, `` activity is at a snail's pace,'' one dealer said. Another trader said that buying interest `` dried up'' because of the lack of takeover rumors which were so prevalent in the market earlier in the week.

<HEAD>Dollar Moves Higher, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose against major currencies Friday in very sluggish European trading. Gold prices fell. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar rose mostly on pre-weekend short covering and technical factors rather than for fundamental reasons. `` It was a thin, poor day and you ca n't overglamorize the dollar's move,'' said a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealer. The British pound cost $ 1.8880 late Friday, cheaper for buyers than late Thursday's $ 1.8990. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where trading ends of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.35 yen to a closing 124.65 in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 124.85 yen. Other dollar rates at late Friday, compared with late Thursday: 1.6730 West German marks, up from 1.6660; 1.3840 Swiss francs, up from 1.3755; 5.6865 French francs, up from 5.6550; 1.8770 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8675; 1,244.50 Italian lire, up from 1,238.50; and 1.2324 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2329.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was ordered by a state judge Friday to hold a shareholders' meeting May 6 to determine whether the company should merge with rival <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> or sell a major stake to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second-largest bank. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> had postponed its annual meeting from Saturday to June 13 to give shareholders time to review the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> bid and a management-backed offer from the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION>, made earlier this week. But <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> challenged the legality of Thursday's move, denouncing it as a stalling tactic and an `` outrageous and unprecedented attempt to thwart the rights of shareholders.'' In Friday's ruling, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON> directed <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> to convene its meeting Saturday, then adjourn it to May 6 to allow time for the shareholders to vote on a slate of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> directors and other matters that will determine the fate of the two competing bids for the bank. Both <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said they were pleased with <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON>'s order. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Falise </PERSON> said, `` The court's decision ... confirms <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s decision to give shareholders more time to learn about and analyze the fast-moving developments of recent days and any other development that may happen before May 6. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the court provided `` a victory for shareholder democracy'' by refusing to allow <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> to postpone its annual meeting until late spring. `` Once again, the manipulative tactics of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s management have been rejected by the courts,'' he said. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said Thursday that it had agreed to negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> for the first time in their bitter, 7-month-old takeover fight, but also would continue negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said it believed it could obtain improvements in both offers. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> is offering $ 15 in cash and 1.575 of its common shares for the approximately 95 percent of Irving it doesnt' already own The tender offer began last month following regulatory approval. The company also is running a slate of 16 nominees for <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board of directors <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION>, which emerged as a `` white knight'' merger partner Monday, has offered to pay $ 75 a share for 8.5 million Irving shares, or a 45 percent stake in the company. <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> also would have the right to buy an additional 10 percent of Irving stock on the open market after the deal was consummated. The deal was part of a complex restructuring that <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> proposed as an alternative to <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile offer. The plan included the sale of several Irving assets, including its 50-story Wall Street headquarters. To win shareholder support, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> also proposed to raise net income by about $ 1.60 a share in 1988 and $ 2.75 next year through cost-cutting measures and to pay a special $ 10-a-share special cash dividend from the gains on the asset sales.

 Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid forecasts as weather forecasters reduced predictions for rainfall.

 Financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> offered Friday to buy the 23 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock that he does not already own, resurrecting his proposal to take the company private. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who is <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, dropped a similar proposal after the stock market crashed on Oct. 19. Under the new plan, stockholders other than <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> would receive for each of their shares a combination of $ 20 in cash and $ 29 in face amount of notes paying 12 percent interest due in 2008. The company has 30 million common shares outstanding, of which <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> controls 77 percent. The announcement sent <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s stock up sharply. In late afternoon trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> was up $ 7.25 a share at $ 35.37 -LCB-. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, airline analyst for the securities firm <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, called the offer `` a good deal for shareholders ... generous in price.'' `` The difficulty is putting a discounted value on the paper,'' he said. `` We'd put it at a -LRB- combined -RRB- value in the low $ 40s.'' That would make the offer worth at least $ 276 million, at $ 40 per share for the 6.9 million shares <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> does not already control. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starkman </PERSON>, who watches <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s offer was `` a little richer than what a lot of people were looking for.'' `` We're thinking in terms of its being worth $ 36 to $ 38 -LRB- per share -RRB-, roughly _ and those kind of numbers look pretty good,'' he said. <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldutis </PERSON>, an analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> securities firm, declined to comment on <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s offer, other than to say he believed <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s stock was worth between $ 40 and $ 42 per share. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s previous offer was $ 20 in cash and $ 25 in face amount of the bonds per share. A statement released by <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> said the new offer was conditioned on approval by a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> shareholders not affiliated with <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, and the satisfaction of appropriate regulatory requirements. In addition, it said <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> reserved the right to change the terms, if <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s stake in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> _ consisting of about 20.6 million shares, or 8.5 percent of the oil giant's stock _ should change substantially in value. Once consummated, employee stock ownership plans would be established to give the airline's employees about 10 percent ownership in the newly merged company, a statement issued by <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> said. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> announced it lost $ 55.5 million in the first quarter, slightly less than the $ 54.8 million it lost in the same period last year. `` These results reflect substantially greater interest charges during the first quarter of 1988 than existed in the first quarter of 1987 and do not include unrealized gains of approximately $ 340 million from <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s portfolio of marketable securites,'' a statement said. Nearly $ 220 million of those gains occurred in the first quarter, it added. The company said its $ 7.8 million first-quarter operating loss _ which compared with a $ 24.3 million operating loss in the same period of 1987 _ `` was the best operating performance for <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s traditionally most unprofitable quarter in over 20 years. Operating revenues totaled $ 920,225 in the three months ended March 31, compared with $ 823,998 in the 1987 first quarter.

 <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kellog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, two giant food companies, on Friday reported improved first quarter earnings partly due to strong sales. <PERSON> Borden </PERSON> said its profit for the first three months of this year climbed 19 percent, to $ 52.39 million, or $ 71 cents a share. That compared with a net income of $ 44.03 million, or 60 cents a share, a year ago. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> company said sales totaled $ 1.6 billion, up 11.9 percent from $ 1.43 billion. <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said it netted $ 121.1 million, or 98 cents per share, up 15.9 percent from earnings of $ 104.5 million, or 85 cents a share. Sales during the period totaled $ 1.03 billion, vs. $ 896 million last year. <PERSON> Borden </PERSON>, which makes a number of consumer food products as well as professional products such as glue and paint, attributed its results to strong sales and acquisitons. `` Acquisitions over the past year were a major factor in these record figures, but we also benefited from improvements in our ongoing businesses,'' Chairman <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ventres </PERSON> said in a statement prepared for Friday's stockholders meeting in <LOCATION> Flemington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` Margins were up slightly in dairy, our base <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> snacks and pasta businesses both posted higher sales and income, and overseas our food joint venture in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and our chemical specialties units did especially well.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaMothe </PERSON> said the increases reflect continued international growth. `` Our heavy investment in marketing, research and development, and the expansion and modernization of production facilities continues to contribute to our growth,'' <PERSON> LaMothe </PERSON> said. He said the company also benefited from a lower tax rate. <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> manufactures a number of consumer food products, including ready-to-eat cereals and other convenience foods.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday reported a 13 percent rise in its first quarter profit over a year ago, boosted partly on the strength of its financial services unit. For the three months ended March 31, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> netted $ 152 million, or $ 1.37 a share, compared with earnings of $ 135 million, or $ 1.25 a share, last year. Revenue also grew, to $ 3.8 billion from $ 3.4 billion. The company said revenue from its financial services division totaled $ 1.2 billion in the quarter, up from $ 1 billion in the 1987 quarter. Income in that division jumped 14 percent, to $ 88 million from $ 78 million. <ORGANIZATION> Crum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Forster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a property and casualty insurance subsidiary, contributed $ 91 million in income, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> also was up, mainly from <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> equipment financing. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> said sales of business products and systems, including computers, typewriters and copiers, grew by 9 percent, to $ 2.6 billion from $ 2.4 billion. But the company said currency exchange rates accounted for about two-thirds of the increase. Income from that division totaled $ 64 million, up 12 percent from $ 57 million. `` Continued emphasis on meeting customer requirements and ongoing cost control should produce another good year for <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>, barring any major economic dislocation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allaire </PERSON> said the company plans to introduce several new products this year, including a new line of copiers to be shown for the first time in the country on May 3.

<HEAD>Lotus Chairman Exercises His Options To Make $26.3 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Last August, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzi </PERSON> exercised his options. The 36-year-old head of the nation's leading software and personal computer maker bought 843,691 shares of company stock at a price that realized a net value of $ 25,356,425, according to company reports. Toss in his salary and bonuses, and <PERSON> Manzi </PERSON> made about $ 26.3 million in 1987, outpacing <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> by about $ 8.4 million on a list of top-paid executives compiled by Business Week magazine. Some Wall Street analysts say <PERSON> Manzi </PERSON> simply was shrewd to take advantage of a boom year for the computer company known for its Lotus 1-2-3 software. But when <PERSON> Manzi </PERSON> turned around and sold a huge chunk of stock six months later, he used the system to the detriment of the average stockholder, they said. `` I think if companies are going to issue the amount of options that <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> does, then management should be proud to be a shareholder in the company and not use the options to continually cash in,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Under the system of stock options, executives are given the opportunity to buy company stock at a set market price. They can exercise the option years afterward when the stock price may be trading above the option price. They generally are used as incentives under the theory that if an executive's performance rises, so will the company's value. `` In general I root for these executives who get big paychecks from chasing in stock options,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, an economics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` There has been a boom market that helps those firms a lot. By far the best measure of performance is the stock price.'' <PERSON> Manzi </PERSON> was given a lucrative package of compensation incentives when he joined <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> in 1983, a time when the company already was succeeding. The former newspaper reporter became marketing director and quickly rose to president in 1984. He exercised his stock options in a year that saw <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> stock jump 78 percent, ending the year at $ 30.75 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. In February, <PERSON> Manzi </PERSON> said he sold 250,000 shares in order to pay taxes on the options earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> defended the sales by <PERSON> Manzi </PERSON> and other executives, which preceded a drop in the company's earnings forecast and a delay in a new version of its popular 1-2-3 electronic spreadsheet program. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzi </PERSON> is one of <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>' largest shareholders and substantially all of the gains he realized in 1987 from stock options have been reinvested in the company,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schechter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>' chief financial officer, said in a statement. `` His compensation ... reflects not just his 1987 compensation, but more accurately an amount earned over four years when his compensation package was assembled.'' Critics of stock options say that lucrative compensation packages often give executives a free ride if the stock market is rising even if individual performance is sluggish. And if a company's gains already are high, executives may try to preserve what they already have instead of investing anew, which shareholders might prefer. `` For very senior managements at the corporate level, stock options make lots of sense because what they do is link the interests of top management with the owners of the firm,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> accounting professor. But he added that `` having lots of stock options does n't necessarily make management as aggressive as shareholders would like them to be in terms of ventures and new investments. As for <PERSON> Manzi </PERSON>'s $ 941,000 cash earnings, analysts said they're not out of line _ even though <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> is not a Fortune 500 company and it reported a net income of $ 72 million last year. `` It's clearly a lot but -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has had some pretty spectacular performances,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, vice president for executive pay practice at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> consulting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Towers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perrin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION>. `` If you really believe that paper performance is what it's about, then when you make it you pay it.

 <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it rejected a $ 1.22 billion takeover offer from rival bidders whose joint buyout proposal includes splitting the textile giant's assets among them. A special committee of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' board informed fabric maker <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> that their joint $ 68.50-a-share cash proposal was unacceptable in its present form. The directors, who met late Thursday to review the proposal, objected to conditioning the joint deal on Odyssey getting financing and completing the purchase of about $ 530 million in <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' assets. Instead, directors backed Odyssey's separate, outstanding $ 68.50-a-share tender offer, which is due to expire at midnight Tuesday and would assure a quick resolution to the takeover battle. A source close to the transaction said the joint proposal would take longer to complete and could allow the principals to back out. Analysts were puzzled over why financing would be an issue, since Odyssey already has received over $ 1 billion in commitments to fund its own bid. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> has a competing $ 67-a-share tender offer outstanding which also expires Tuesday. The special committee said it would back the <LOCATION> Pepperell-Odyssey </LOCATION> plan only if `` it had no conditions relating to the Odyssey asset transaction.'' In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' stock closed at $ 67.50 a share, unchanged from Thursday. Analysts speculated that <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> might have reached the upper limit of its financing capacity and might need the proceeds from the asset sale to Odyssey to clinch the deal. `` They might be running out of money,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronston </PERSON>, a textile analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Odyssey and <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>, which bid against each other three times in a heated auction, announced Tuesday that they were holding talks about making a joint bid for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> Odyssey had appeared to be playing the `` white knight'' role by coming on the scene with a friendly offer after <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> had made its first unsolicited offer. Now, however, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> `` feels it has been stabbed in the back,'' said one analyst who asked not to be named. One source close to the transaction said <PERSON> Odyssey </PERSON> `` feels they owe some degree of loyalty to both sides.'' Among the assets Odyssey likely would purchase were <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' unfinished textile operations The division sells about $ 235 million a year in unfinished fabrics and yarn. Separately, the attorneys general of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> have issued subpoenas to <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bibb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has signed an agreement with <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> to purchase certain <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> assets. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> <PERSON> Medlock </PERSON> said Thursday he was concerned the three companies, in combining their efforts to acquire <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, may have engaged in `` bid-rigging'' to determine what price to pay for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> stock. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Braithwaite </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, said that `` two competing bidders talking about the price and purchase of -LRB- <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> -RRB- raises questions under state and federal antitrust laws.'' The subpoenas seek documents and testimony about `` alleged discussions concerning the acquisition of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>,'' he said. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> noted in a statement Friday that it has `` not been accused of any -LRB- antitrust -RRB- violations, and we are confident everything we have done is in accord with all applicable laws.'' The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, textile company is making its bid for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION> NTC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of textile manufacturer <PERSON> Bibb </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> has received <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> permission to sell half of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet lines to <ORGANIZATION> NTC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 170 million. Analysts agreed that <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s interest in <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> centers exclusively on the company's sheet and towel operations, which include manufacturing facilities as well as designer brand names. Those operations account for 60 percent of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' annual sales, which amounted to $ 1.61 billion last year. Among the top brand names in <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' towel and sheet arsenal are <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Gloria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Givenchy </PERSON>, among others. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s brands include Arrow, Martex, <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepperell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burberry </PERSON>. Separately, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said Friday it planned to file a counterclaim against <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> charging that <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> interfered with <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' existing merger agreement with Odyssey.

Production of the Omni-Horizon models is being shifted at the end of the 1988 model year to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s Jefferson Avenue plant from <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, plant, at a cost of 5,500 jobs.

 Blue-chip issues led the stock market higher Friday in an advance aided by declining interest rates. Trading remained quiet, however.

 The dollar finished slightly higher against most major currencies Friday in the same light trading that characterized dealings throughout the week. Gold prices fell sharply. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 449.50 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 454.65 Thursday. Analysts said the dollar rose on technical factors. There was virtually no reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report that orders for durable goods were virtually unchanged last month. `` Basically the dollar has done nothing all day,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>, a vice president and trader at <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` There's no reason for the dollar to break out of the current levels _ the central banks have the markets very well under control,'' he said. Traders said investors were concentrating their holdings in the so-called high-yielding currencies, including the British pound. `` Sterling was a little softer, which prompted a little buying of dollars,'' noted <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the dollar rose but trading was very sluggish. `` It was a thin, poor day and you ca n't overglamorize the dollar's move,'' said a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealer In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where trading ends of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.35 yen to a closing 124.65 in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 124.85 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 124.915 yen, up from 124.27 yen on Thursday.

 The new federal rules banning smoking on flights under two hours may send some inveterate smokers climbing the cabin walls, but airlines and experts on smoking have been quick to offer advice. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preventive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, for example, has developed a kit called `` Flying Smokeless.'' The institute, based in <LOCATION> Southfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, runs quit-smoking and other health programs at hospitals and businesses around the companies. It's selling the kits _ a cassette tape and a `` smokeless emergency pack'' _ for $ 11.45. Dr. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the group's executive director, says several airlines have expressed interest in buying the program, including <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>. The cassette `` teaches behavior modification techniques that overcome the desire to smoke,'' the institute says, while the pack contains cigarette substitutes such as sugarless gum, mints and toothpicks. Other tips from <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> include putting a rubber band around the wrist of your smoking hand and snapping it whenever a nicotine urge strikes. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which has been gearing up for the smoking ban since April 13, offers some suggestions from its medical director, Dr. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohn </PERSON>: _ Put something in your mouth other than a cigarette Chew gum. Carry some celery or a carrot on a flight and munch on it. Inhale on a straw or suck on a toothpick or cinnamon sticks. Carry breath mints, throat lozenges or hard candies. _ If you usually smoke while drinking coffee, soft drinks or alcohol during flights, try switching to fruit juices, water or milk _ Share thoughts by striking up a conversation with a fellow passenger instead of striking a match for a cigarette Write letters and notes to friends and family. Compose a business memo. _ Practice deep breathing Breathe in slowly through your nose for two counts, exhale slowly through pursed lips for a count of four. _ Read a book or a magazine Dr. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, on the other hand, is n't keen on the idea of reading in every case. He advises jittery smokers to recognize `` cues'' that trigger smoking, such as reading or drinking coffee, and avoid them. If these do n't work, there's a powerful stimulus that should stifle the smoking urge: the fines of up to $ 1,000 for violating the federal ban.

 Orders to the nation's factories for `` big ticket'' items remained strong in March, the government said Friday, bolstering analysts' views that the economy is growing at a healthy pace. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, were virtually unchanged, rising less than 0.1 percent to $ 114.3 billion in March as a drop in military hardware more than offset gains elsewhere. That was far less than the 1.3 percent advance most economists were expecting. However, the government raised its estimate of new orders in February. The revised report shows a 0.1 percent gain for the month, rather than the previously reported 1.1 percent drop. The net result is a relatively strong level of orders through the first quarter of this year, 7.9 percent above a year ago when compared March to March. `` I would describe it as a ... picture that shows modest growth in the economy, not a boom but no signs of a big dip,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm, said it is `` very premature'' to worry about sluggish growth in new orders because shipments remain strong and the backlog in unfilled orders remains high. Nevertheless, the lower-than-expected results for March, along with a stronger dollar overseas, helped both the bond and stock markets, which have been depressed over fears of inflation and higher interest rates. The key 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond's price rose about $ 5 per $ 1,000 in face amount and its yield fell back under 9 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.69 points to 2,015.09. Shipments of durable goods rose 2.6 percent last month to $ 113.3 billion after a 1.4 percent rise in February. The backlog of unfilled orders was up 0.2 percent to $ 399.9 billion in March, following a 1.0 percent rise the month before. `` A tremendous backlog has built up, so shipments will remain high no matter how many new orders come in,'' <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON> said. `` ... If orders held flat for the rest of the year, you would still get a very strong level of shipments compared to last year.'' In March, a 3.0 percent drop in the volatile defense goods category, to $ 8.3 billion, offset a 0.3 percent increase in orders for non-defense goods, which rose to $ 106.0 billion. Orders for primary metals such as steel jumped 4.2 percent in March after rising 0.9 percent in February. At $ 10.8 billion, they stood 19.4 percent ahead of last year. There was also strength in transportation, primarily motor vehicles and aircraft. This sector rose 2.5 percent to $ 31.3 billion, after a strong 5.5 percent boost in February. Orders for electrical machinery plummeted 4.7 percent to $ 18.6 billion, while non-electrical machinery edged down 0.2 percent to $ 19.7 billion. However, orders in both categories remained 13 percent above a year ago. `` Smokestack U.S.A. is back. We've got strong growth in the basic areas like steel. That's really pacing the economy now. The problem is that growth might be too strong,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Langston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. After the October stock market crash, analysts worried about a slowdown in the economy during the first three months of this year. However, they now are more concerned that too much demand could increase inflation. Strong demand overseas for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods, spurred by the devalued dollar, and a subsequent need by American manufacturers for machinery are expected to keep the economy growing. The key category of non-defense capital goods, which economists consider a good indicator of factory expansion plans, was $ 33.3 billion in March, 20.1 percent higher than a year earlier. However, the most recent monthly numbers show a dip in orders _ a 1.3 percent decline in March and a 3.0 drop in February.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union said Friday that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to import the <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aries </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reliant </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> next year threatens chances of an early contract settlement and increases the likelihood of a strike. `` I hearby warn the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that if they cause these negotiations to go in the ditch, the chances of a strike in September would be 95 percent or better,'' <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> told a news conference. The flap is the latest of several since the opening Monday of early national labor contract negotiations between the No. 3 automaker and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>. The contract covers at least 66,000 workers in 15 states. Workers and union negotiators also were angered by the compensation executives received in 1987. The figures, including $ 17.9 million <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> received in salary, cash and stock bonuses and exercised stock options, were revealed in proxy statements mailed Tuesday. In addition, <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> has said that despite <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s assurances otherwise, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is trying to veer sharply from an industry-pattern contract established at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> last fall. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s chief bargainer, denied <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is transferring production of the soon-to-be discontinued Aries-Reliant K-car to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> at the expense of American jobs. Instead, he said production at an existing K-car plant in <LOCATION> Toluca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, will be boosted by 40,000 cars for one year while <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> K-car plants are converted to making other products. Ironically, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is selling the front-wheel-drive K-cars, whose success saved <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> from bankruptcy in the early 1980s, as `` America series'' models. St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said the total number of K-cars exported to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ 60,000 between Oct. 1, 1988 and Sept. 30, 1989 _ would be enough to support only one third of one shift at either <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, or Jefferson Avenue <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> plant Each plant can build 235,000 cars a year using two shifts. The temporary increase in <LOCATION> Toluca </LOCATION> production will provide cars primarily to fill fleet orders during the K-car phaseout, he said. Meanwhile, the venerable Omni-Horizon small car will be moved into <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> from a former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION> this summer and the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> plant will begin building the Spirit and Acclaim, the K-car's replacement. St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> will employ as many or more workers making the Omni-Horizon as it does now. Workers and government officials in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> were angered by the announcement because they believed the Omni-Horizon could have been kept at the 5,500-worker <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> plant, slated to close by year's end, if the <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> plant continued to make the K-car. But <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said he understood that K-car production would n't be high enough to support <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>. He said the company should keep the K-car and build it on the same assembly line with the Omni-Horizon, disagreeing with <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s assertion that it was n't possible The subject of importing cars from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is a particularly sore one at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> because while the company emphasizes patriotism in its advertising, it imports many of its cars, including all models in its new Eagle lineup. At the same time, it is closing the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> plant and tried to sell its 28,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary so it could buy more from outside companies and low-wage foreign countries. Chrysler <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers earn $ 14.43 an hour. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers earn $ 2 to $ 2.50 an hour, said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Northard </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Plunge As Dollar Strengthens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Gold futures prices fell sharply Friday, surprising analysts and extending the metal's decline over four days on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to more than $ 9 a troy ounce On other markets, pork belly futures plunged while livestock futures were mixed; soybeans advanced while grains were mixed; energy futures were mostly lower; and stock index futures advanced. Metals analysts said the stronger dollar may have had some negative impact on precious metals markets but not enough to fully explain the plunge in gold futures, which lost as much as $ 6.10 a troy ounce during the session. `` I was n't expecting a sell-off today of this sort of magnitude,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, vice president of the metals and foreign exchange group at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Analyst <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said a government report showing virtually no change last month in factory orders for durable goods was somewhat disappointing, but also was hardly enough to spark Friday's decline in metals. `` There's been no real negative news,'' he said. `` I guess there's just been nothing exciting going on and the market has sold off and just kind of fed on itself for a while.'' Another analyst, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Savakl </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, linked the sell-off to talk of Japanese sales of platinum and government concern over Taiwanese purchases of gold. Gold settled $ 4.50 to $ 6.10 lower with the contract for delivery in June at $ 452.40 a troy ounce; silver was 4.5 cents to 5.3 cents lower with May at $ 6.415 a troy ounce. Pork belly futures plunged as much as 1.32 cents a pound on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on expectations that a monthly government report issued after the close would show a large increase in the number of bellies in cold storage. The assumption was correct. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> counted about 90.5 million pounds of frozen pork bellies at the end of March, an increase of nearly 23.5 million pounds during the month and the third-largest March 31 total on record. Analyst <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said the report would have little market impact since it matched expectations. But two other <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> reports issued Friday _ the monthly and quarterly cattle-on-feed reports _ will likely send cattle futures 50 to 100 points lower on Monday, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. The quarterly report showed a 6 percent increase since last year in the total number of cattle being fattened for slaughter, a 2 percent rise in placements on feedlots during the first quarter and a 1 percent increase in cattle marketings. The monthly report also showed greater-than-expected numbers of cattle on feed, higher-than-expected placements and lower-than-expected marketings. `` No matter how you cut it, first quarter placements appear to be the largest on record and that has to take some kind of toll in the marketplace,'' <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. Live cattle settled .20 cent lower to .15 cent higher with June at 70.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .48 cent higher with April at 79.97 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent lower to .23 cent higher with June at 48.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .60 cent to 1.32 cents lower with May at 52.02 cents a pound. Soybean futures closed sharply higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as weather forecasters reduced their predictions for next week's rainfall. The grains were mixed. Long-range forecasts issued Thursday predicted good amounts of rain next week in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, where corn and soybean planting is beginning and rain is needed to get the crops off to a good start. Prices fell Thursday in reaction to the forecasts. But new forecasts Friday predicted lesser amounts of rain, and the markets rallied on the news, analysts said. Wheat settled 1 cent lower to \ cent higher with May at $ 3.15 a bushel; corn was 1 \ cents lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 2.01 \ a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent lower to 1 \ cents higher with May at $ 1.64 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents to 6 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 6.63 -LCB- Energy futures settled mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in nervous trading ahead of next week's meeting of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC oil producers, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents to 6 cents lower with June at $ 18.30 a barrel; heating oil was .14 cent lower to .11 cent higher with May at 50.60 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .16 cent lower to .10 cent higher with May at 52.29 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures posted strong gains on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 5.65 points higher at 261.85.

<HEAD>Short-Term Thinking Hurts Competitiveness, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Short-term thinking is hurting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' ability to compete in world markets, according to a survey of leaders in corporate research, universities and state government that was released Friday. The survey was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a business-supported research group, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. People surveyed in all parts of the country said innovation was being blocked by corporate leaders' lack of long-term goals, coupled with a lack of the needed tax incentives. The leaders also said schools need better science, engineering and math education, while colleges need better equipment. Business executives emphasized the need for continued training on the job. Slightly more than half of the business people who responded said they did not think cooperative research between industries and universities would have a critical impact on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness. More than half the business leaders said the federal budget deficit leads the list of fiscal and monetary issues that hurt the nation's competitiveness. Three-quarters of the state government and university leaders felt the same way. The survey was conducted in the winter and spring of 1987 and covered 2,300 senior corporate research and development officials, 500 university leaders, and state officials in all 50 states.

<HEAD>Feds on Boesky's Sentence: 3 Years Was Fair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prosecutors insisted Friday that <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> got a fair punishment for his crimes, despite the convicted speculator's plea for more leniency from a judge who sentenced him to three years imprisonment. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the disgraced stock speculator at the center of a major insider trading scandal, asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> late last week to reduce his sentence for conspiracy to violate securities law. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who could have been sentenced to a maximum five years, said through his lawyers that he deserves milder treatment because he has provided prosecutors with additional evidence on `` new topics, new transactions, new relationships and new securities.'' That disclosure indicated <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> is now giving evidence about people he had n't implicated in earlier statements to prosecutors before his sentencing. <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> in December. The speculator began serving his sentence at a minimum security prison at <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> last month and will be eligible for parole after one year. In a two-page affidavit responding to <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s request, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> is continuing to cooperate and `` the government's investigations relating to information he has provided continues.'' But <PERSON> Carrol </PERSON> also maintained that `` in the government's view, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s three-year sentence was and remains an appropriate sentence in light of all the competing factors.'' In his 35-page affidavit requesting sentence reduction, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> to delay ruling until October, by which time `` the extraordinary extent and value of Mr. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s cooperation will become even more evident. <PERSON> Carrol </PERSON> also agreed that <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> should delay ruling until October. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> was a leading speculator in the stocks of potential takeover targets when he rocked Wall Street in November 1986 by agreeing to pay $ 100 million to settle civil insider trading charges brought by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to settling the civil case without admitting guilt, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> also agreed to plead guilty to the single felony count and has been cooperating since then with prosecutors.

<HEAD>GM Says Cost Cuts Will Top $12.5 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A four-year belt-tightening program at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> could save more than $ 12.5 billion by 1990, up from previous estimates of $ 10 billion, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> officials told auto industry analysts Friday. A wider profit margin as well as a bigger share of the auto market are keys to reaching a 15 percent return on common stockholder equity by that time, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 Automotive Security Analysts meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> told the group 1987 was a transition year for the company. `` Sales and market share rebounded strongly in the first quarter of 1988 compared with the last quarter of 1987,'' <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> said. He said orders have been strong for the new <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regal </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cutlass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> Grand Prix mid-sized coupes. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> will be cutting under-used production capacity so that by 1992 it approaches 100 percent of the capacity of remaining newer, more efficient plants to meet expected demand, <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> said. And he said the company will cut its array of models and options, using more shared components for similarly sized vehicles. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, chief financial officer, said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s `` action plan'' _ designed to cut costs by $ 10 billion through efficiency and productivity improvements from 1987-1990 _ saved $ 3.7 billion in 1987 rather than the $ 3 billion expected in the first year. `` Based on our strong cost-containment efforts to date, and the steps we are now taking, our revised outlook for cumulative 1990 cost savings amounts to between $ 12.5 billion and $ 13 billion,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The financial officer said a production facility modernizing program is nearly complete and total spending on that will decline to about $ 7 billion this year and $ 6 billion in 1990, down from $ 11.7 billion in 1986. <PERSON> Stempel </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GM-United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union teams are working to improve roductivity at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s parts plants, with studies expected to be completed by September. `` We're working very hard with our unions on the question of outsourcing noncompetitive products,'' he said.
