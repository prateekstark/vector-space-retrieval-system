 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in a farewell speech Monday that this was `` a moment of hope'' for peace in the world and that a new U.S.-Soviet treaty to sharply reduce nuclear arms may be concluded next year. He called for an international war on drug traffickers, terrorism and hostage-taking, and vowed to maintain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for an armed insurgency against the leftist government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He said the Sandinistas were pursuing `` the oldest, most corrupt vice of all _ man's age-old will to power, his lust to control the lives and steal the freedoms of others.'' But with his presidency nearing an end, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> struck a mostly philosophical stance as he told the 43rd <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session of 159 nations that civil wars and foreign occupations were giving way around the world. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the trend was spurred by `` a new era in Soviet-American relations'' marked by the continuing withdrawal of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and a treaty last year to abolish intermediate-range nuclear missiles. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators were making steady progress on another accord to sharply reduce long-range bombers, missiles and submarines. While completion of the pact this year was `` highly doubtful,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I can tell you a year from now -LRB- it -RRB- is a possibility, more than a possibility.'' On the conventional front, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said East-West talks to reduce non-nuclear forces, tanks and other mobile weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` will begin soon.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had demanded a Soviet commitment to give equal attention to human rights. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met last week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. Afterward, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the Soviets had promised to release 27 additional political prisoners, to make changes in their emigration procedures and to undertake other reforms. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement indicated the human rights obstacle had been removed After the speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with Foreign Ministers <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Meguid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on prospects for peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Chatting with reporters during a picture-taking session, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he had `` high hopes'' for release of the nine American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian forces. `` But I'm superstitious about calling a no-hitter before the game is over,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The former baseball broadcaster appeared to be referring to the progressive release of French and West German hostages _ and being reluctant to talk about it for fear of upsetting the situation. But <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said `` there is no morsel of information that gives us reason to be more hopeful.'' In the session with <PERSON> Meguid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the president called the 1979 peace treaty between their countries `` a monumental achievement which has changed the face of the region.'' He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal was to move beyond it to an overall settlement that took into account the `` legitimate rights'' of Palestinian Arabs. According to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources, who declined to be further identified, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said that his government would not deal with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> ration Organization so long as they were involved in terrorism and violence and speak of trying to force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> back to the partition lines set by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1947. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, meanwhile, said despite elections in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in November the parties should keep working for negotiations since `` a vacuum is very dangerous.'' In other developments on a busy day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>: _ Met twice with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to assess prospects of ending the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war It was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first meeting with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> since the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement on Sept. 13 that the president was releasing $ 188 million the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had withheld from the organization to show displeasure with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budgetary and hiring _ Scheduled a meeting with Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the former ruler of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Oct. 11 The purpose is to underscore <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for his forces as they compete with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> to take control of the country from pro-Vietnam authorities. _ Met with President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> to register <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resolve for successful completion of negotiations that simultaneously would withdraw Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> _ Met with leaders of <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> countries after deciding to end the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military convoy of U.S.-flagged <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil tankers <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials stressed American warships would remain in the gulf prepared to come to the aid of commercial ships under attack. The president's speech was the most upbeat of the seven speeches he has made before the world body. From <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> is trying to formalize a cease-fire to end the eight-year war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, prospects for peace are bright, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said earlier Monday that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had decided to end the 14-month program of providing <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> escorts to re-flagged Kuwaiti oil tankers in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, but he still would maintain a naval presence there to aid threatened ships. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> acted `` after reviewing the current cease-fire ... which has been in effect since August 20, and consulting with allies and friends in the region.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I stand at this podium, then, in a moment of hope _ hope not just for the peoples of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but for all the peoples of the world.'' In arms control, he said, `` the logjam is broken'' by the ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet intermediate-range missiles, progress toward a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and the onset of negotiations between the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact on conventional forces. `` History teaches caution,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. But his speech was upbeat, and he traced the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations to the first summit meeting he had held with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> nearly three years ago. `` So if future generations do say of us that, in our time, peace came closer, that we did bring about new seasons of truth and justice, it will be cause for pride,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>FAA Chief Says Air Safety Improving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Aviation safety is improving, and technology and training programs are now in place to prevent most major air disasters, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. `` I reject any notion from anybody that would assert that aviation safety is somehow declining,'' <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said during a visit to the <ORGANIZATION> Mike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monroney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Near-collision reports are down 67 percent from last year; pilot errors are down 63 percent and controller errors are down 18 percent, <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said. Also down are aviation-related fatalities and delays, he said. `` Aviation safety is improving. That does not mean aviation safety can not continue to improve. We have a lot of work to do. But we should never be caught in the trap of assuming that accident rates reflect aviation safety,'' he said, explaining that as air travel increases, the number of accidents also would increase. Technological advancements in such things as radar, combined with improved pilot training programs have reduced the danger of wind shear to air travelers, <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said. `` Wind shear has been with us since the dawn of aviation. But just now, we have the technology and the training that can recognize these microburst conditions,'' he said. He referred to sudden shifts in wind direction and speed caused when a mass of cooled air rushes downward out of a thunderstorm, a condition that can especially endanger planes taking off and landing. Just last week, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> announced that airplanes themselves will now be required to carry equipment that can detect wind shear, and to display steering commands so pilots can escape the conditions, <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said. In addition, he said all airlines are now training pilots in simulators to recognize conditions of wind shear and to escape from them safely. He said the 1985 crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> that killed 137 people probably could have been prevented if such measures had been in place at the time.

 A neighborhood trying to buck bureaucracy, middlemen and rising inflation has created <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first consumer food cooperative in 30 years. The Tiantan Residential Area Consumer Cooperative in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> opened in April and already has 9,000 members who paid 5 yuan -LRB- $ 1.30 -RRB- a share for access to fresh and sometimes cheaper vegetables, milk, eggs, matches, food oils and other consumer goods. `` Our only purpose is to serve the people,'' said the co-op's general manager, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingson </PERSON> It is run entirely by people living near the landmark Temple of Heaven in southern <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Consumer cooperatives existed in the early years after the Communist government came to power in 1949, but were taken over by the state in 1957, `` when our economy became more developed,'' <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said. The idea has been revived three decades later as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> goes through the painful process of ending price controls and letting the value of most food products be determined by market forces. Prices for many vegetables and other food items have doubled in the past year amid an overall inflation rate of around 20 percent. The reluctance of farmers to grow low-profit crops, difficulties in transport and widespread profiteering in scarce commodities have added to the price spiral, the most serious problem facing the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> economy today. The Tiantan Neighborhood <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> decided to start the co-op, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said, mainly to `` eliminate all kinds of troubles happening between producers and consumers.'' The cooperative has signed contracts with several farm villages outside <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for supply and delivery of cucumbers, milk, sesame oil and other items, which are stocked in some of the 40 shops now run by the cooperative. Most of the 100 people working for the cooperative are retired from regular jobs or unemployed, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuyuan </PERSON>, 69, said she came out of retirement to run a little corner shop that sells soft drinks, canned goods and fresh foods because `` I wanted something to do.'' Now, she says she works up to 12 hours a day and takes home a wage pegged to the shop's sales and averaging about 100 yuan -LRB- $ 27 -RRB- a month, on a par with a factory worker's salary. Shoppers, she said, are `` quite satisfied, they've got no quarrels'' with the cooperative products. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said the little groceries barely break even, but the cooperative is earning good profits from several larger retail stores. He said shareholders should receive dividends larger than interest rates on bank savings deposits. He added that as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> switches to a commodity-based economy, the government permits consumers to have various shopping options. The co-op, he said, will be a `` little brother'' to state-owned food shops and will not hurt the free markets that now supply urban residents with much of their better-quality if more expensive food. Although elimination of middlemen will mean better prices for co-op members, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said, prices will generally be pegged to those in state stores but that holding the line on price rises will be tough. He expressed confidence, however, that the co-op could provide good service at reasonable prices, `` and make things a little easier for our residents.''

 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> completes 10 years in power Wednesday, pressing ahead with policies that have disenchanted blacks and whites across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s political spectrum. Not interested in charming his way to popularity, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has presented himself as a stern, dedicated patriot leading his country on a precarious path between outright racism and black majority rule. Lately, his balancing act has won little praise. Growing numbers of right-wing whites feel he has gone too far in extending power to blacks, while white liberals and a solid core of blacks believe he has fallen woefully short. The criticisms, and increasingly frequent calls for new leadership, sometimes rankle <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, but he is unapologetic. `` My attitude is that I am doing what I believe to be right and in the interests of the country,'' he recently told a television interviewer who sought an assessment of 10 turbulent years. In his early years in power, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> had a broad mandate from whites for his twin goals of maintaining stability while moving away from rigid apartheid. The Sunday Times, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper and a critic of the government, commented this month, `` Mr. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s place in history is assured. It required courage to lead his people out of the cul-de-sac of apartheid, even if the final destination of their new course remains uncharted.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, 72, became head of the white-minority government on Sept. 28, 1978, when <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members elected him prime minister over more moderate and more conservative rivals. He had been in the Cabinet since 1961 and became defense minister in 1966. His first speech as prime minister stressed a theme that remains dear to him _ the paramount importance of national security in the face of a purported communist-led `` total onslaught.'' A year later, in one of his most quoted remarks, he sounded a different theme, telling whites: `` We must adapt, otherwise we will die.'' In 1984, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> helped push through a new constitution that brought Asians and people of mixed race into the previously all-white <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, but continued to exclude blacks. One result was black anger that ignited two years of nationwide political violence. The constitution abolished the post of prime minister, and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> became president. His critics say he has steadily increased the power of the executive branch since then while weakening <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1984, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has been credited with the repeal of several of apartheid's most hurtful laws, including those that banned interracial marriages and required blacks to have a permit to be in whites-only areas. These reforms, along with promises of limited power-sharing with blacks, triggered a wave of defections by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s fellow Afrikaners from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Botha </ORGANIZATION>'s anniversary comes as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> verges on losing support of a majority of whites for the first time since it gained power 40 years ago. The party won 55 percent of the vote in whites-only general elections in May 1987, while 26 percent went to the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and 19 percent to liberal candidates. The Conservatives are believed to have gained strength since then and could outpoll the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in nationwide local elections Oct. 26. Many liberals believe <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has gone as far as he is willing to go toward substantive reform. The president has declared that some aspects of apartheid are non-negotiable _ he rejects equal voting rights for blacks and insists that whites retain segregated neighborhoods and schools. `` We are forever told that President <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s government has chosen the path fo reform and should be given a chance,'' wrote black newspaper editor <PERSON> Khulu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibiya </PERSON>. `` What chance, when they move one step forward and three backwards?'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, whose government has detained thousands of black activists during a 27-month-old state of emergency, says most blacks view him favorably. Opinion polls suggest otherwise. This month, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> held his first summit meetings in black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. He visited <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, a longtime friend of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, a longtime adversary. Some critics say <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> is more willing to take chances in the international arena than at home. `` One has to say that P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> lacks imagination,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Soal </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member for the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` He has failed to deal creatively with black political aspirations.'' Even some of <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s own Cabinet ministers feel he should step down, said Soal. `` Is there someone with the guts to tell him?''

<HEAD>Despot Ne Win May Still Be Calling The Shots In Burma</HEAD>

 Ne Win, who resigned two months ago after 26 years of despotic rule, is widely believed to still be the top man in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> orchestrating moves to put down the anti-government uprising. Many Western diplomats and <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> believe <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> has been calling the shots since he stepped down July 23 as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that has ruled the country for a quarter century. `` I would say the almost universal perception and opinion among Burmese is that Ne Win is still the government of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>,'' a Rangoon-based diplomat said. Ne Win, 77, has remained out of public sight since he resigned, and there is no indisputable evidence he remains the most powerful figure. But observers characterize the men who have led the government since he stepped down as long-time associates of Ne Win who dare not make any major move without his assent. Diplomats said military commander Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> visited Ne Win at his home in the plush northern <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> suburbs around scenic <LOCATION> Inya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> before launching a coup Sept. 18 that began a harsh crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. The Rangoon-based diplomat said `` a number of -LRB- other -RRB- meetings have been held at critical times'' between Ne Win and top officials. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who became head of the party and state to succeed Ne Win in July, was a military leader known for his ruthlessness and long-time political association with Ne Win. When protests against <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s authoritarian rule increased in August, he was replaced by civilian <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, who served as Ne Win's legal adviser and wrote a flattering book about him called `` <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and General Ne Win.'' <PERSON> Tzang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yawnghwe </PERSON>, an author and son of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first president, described <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> as `` one of the few Burmese intellectuals who sincerely and deeply admired Gen. Ne Win.'' <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> was removed from power by <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> when promises to hold the first multiparty elections since 1960 failed to end massive anti-government street demonstrations and a crippling general strike. <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, who was promoted to armed forces commander in 1985, is regarded as a hardliner who during most of his 39-year army career has loyally followed orders from Ne Win. Ne Win `` did n't raise up a generation of leaders but raised a generation of followers to do his bidding,'' a Bangkok-based diplomat observed. Another diplomat said the three successors are generally viewed as `` absolutely beholden'' to the charismatic Ne Win, whose unquestioned supremacy over the capable, well-organized 186,000-man military since his 1962 coup is seen as the key to his lasting power. The opposition so far has been unable to draw into its fold the rank-and-file soldiers and their officers, who in the past week shot and killed largely unarmed, peaceful demonstrators and broke up dozens of protest centers throughout the nation. `` What striking about it is the ruthlessness of his -LRB- Ne Win's -RRB- tactics,'' the Bangkok-based diplomat said. Japanese <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> expert <PERSON> Minoru </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiryu </PERSON> suggests, however, that events of recent weeks do not follow a `` Ne Win scenario,'' since the coup leaders abolished virtually all the state organizations built up by the military strongman. Ne Win first came to prominence as one of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s `` Thirty Comrades'' who played a key role in the fight for independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. He ended <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s shaky post-independence experiment with democracy by leading the 1962 coup. Ne Win quickly vowed to lead his country on a neutralist, egalitarian and moralistic `` Burmese road to socialism.'' But inefficiency, corruption and black marketeering soon spread throughout the system and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, rich in natural resources and once the world's largest exporter of rice, is now one of the world's poorest nations The failure to oust Ne Win and his cronies despite the popular uprising has led to `` certainly a tremendous mood of depression and disillusionment in the country,'' the Rangoon-based diplomat said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An illusion has been dashed for <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, who won his last <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> election in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> by shaking scores of thousands of hands and spending $ 145. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> since 1957, won that election in 1982 with 64 percent of the vote and without spending a dime on television commercials. But in the scramble to succeed him _ a scuffle that began when he announced earlier this year that he would not seek re-election _ a new reality of the American political process emerged. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> has found that money does in fact talk. The senator predicted the result earlier this year even before <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s voters picked free-spending millionaire businessman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who never has held public office, as the Democratic senatorial nominee over a list of veteran politicians. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> described to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> the way he had established a victorious and enduring political career by shaking hands and ringing doorbells. He also correctly described what can happen when all that hard work comes up against big money. `` Meet just as many voters as you can _ day after day, month after month, year after year,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> speech. `` The numbers are critical,'' he said. `` They add up. You can literally meet hundreds every day. By campaigning on main streets and shopping malls for seven or eight hours a day you can hit a couple of thousand. `` Go out to baseball and football games, state fairs, busy summer festivals ... and you can meet as many as a thousand an hour _ literally. `` Keep that up year after year and you build remarkable long-term support,'' he said. `` When you run statewide a few times ... an astonishing number remember you. Many of the hundred-thousand people you met in your 1952 campaign for governor still remember meeting you when they vote in 1982. `` With every election that passes you have more of those beautiful voters in the bank.'' It was a `` magic'' that never failed him. But it was not a road that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, a relatively unknown face, chose to follow. According to <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> got his name recognition with money, not by meeting voters one after the other. `` All that magic can blow away like a puff of smoke in a hurricane when your opponent turns up with $ 2 million or $ 3 million to buy television time and the good judgment of the experts to tell him precisely how to build on it,'' he said. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s Republican opponent, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>, minority leader of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, also is mounting an extensive and expensive television campaign but is expected to be outspent by <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who had pumped $ 4 million into his campaign by the end of August. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said that as a result of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s heavy spending in the Democratic primary campaign, `` the three Democratic candidates, qualified by years of service in public office and with long campaigning, were left far behind in the dust.'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>'s conclusion: `` Building constituent support one on one, serving well in public office, can help build a political career, but there is no substitute for money, and lots of it, wisely spent in buying the most seasoned and shrewd media advice and the television time to ring that bell. `` The candidate who has come from nowhere has been a smashing success in business,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said. `` He may, if elected, serve the country and our state as an excellent senator.'' `` But as a retiring senator who followed the other painstaking route of years of one-to-one hard campaigning work,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said, `` I am disillusioned _ and more than a little jealous.''

 The USS New Jersey nearly ran down a yacht carrying anti-nuclear demonstrators as the battleship maneuvered into <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> harbor today through a flotilla of yachts, canoes and surfboards. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s skipper, Capt. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, said his 57,000-ton battlewagon would probably have sunk the yacht had it had not been dragged clear at the last moment. `` If it had not been for that police boat pulling it off we'd have split it in half,'' <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> said `` The guy on that police boat was very brave.'' The police boat managed to secure the yacht and tow it clear seconds before the battleship steamed by. Other protesters in assorted small craft attempted to get alongside the ship and plaster it with anti-nuclear slogans, but were kept away by a cordon of police and Australian navy speed boats. Police and <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> divers jumped into the water to arrest two protesters. <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> Bluefield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said demonstrators, some of them from the international environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, risked their lives coming so close to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> because turbulence from the ship's four 18-foot propellors could have sucked them under water. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> is visiting <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> with an international fleet of more than 40 warships to celebrate the bicentennial of European settlement of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Anti-nuclear demonstrators were protesting the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s presence because it carries Tomahawk cruise missiles The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> refuses to confirm or deny whether the missiles carry nuclear warheads. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, built in 1943, is powered by old-fashioned oil-fired steam engines.

<HEAD>EPA Stance On Ozone-Destroying Compounds Is Cheered By
Environmentalists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Environmentalists hailed a call by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> for a global ban on ozone-destroying chloroflurocarbons and related compounds. `` We're glad to see they've come around to our way of thinking,'' said <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> of Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The announcement Monday by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> marked a shift from his view that there was plenty of time to consider what, if any, steps were needed to tighten the terms of an existing international treaty on reducing <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production. That treaty, signed by 45 major nations, pledges signatories to a 50 percent cut by 1998. The <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds are widely used as refrigeration fluids, solvents and foam blowing agents and, outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as aerosol propellants. Related bromine compounds are used in fire extinguishers. Some can last for more than a century, rising to the stratosphere where they eventually break down to liberate chlorine. A major study of ozone by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> last March found ozone depletion of as much as 3 percent at mid-latitudes and attributed it to chlorine. Without cutting off production of CFCs, chlorine and bromine will continue to build up in the atmosphere, destroying high-altitude ozone that protects the Earth from the sun's ultra-violet rays, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said in a new analysis released Monday `` It is increasingly clear that we as a global environmental community must use the -LRB- treaty -RRB- to go even further to eliminate these chemicals which damage the stratospheric ozone layer and threaten our future,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Regretfully, our new analysis predicts an even worse scenario than anticipated,'' he added. Up to now, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> had resisted environmentalist recommendations for a CFC-phaseout. In his remarks Monday, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> mentioned no specific timetable for a phase out. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an environmentalist group, said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> announcement `` underlines the seriousness of the emergency we are facing.'' <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON> predicted the report would `` have a lot of impact'' on major <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> producers abroad. Also on Monday, the major trade association of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> makers and users, the Alliance for a Responsible CFC Policy, announced it, too, now believed the nations of the world should aim at `` phasing out ... CFCs to the maximum extent feasible.'' <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fay </PERSON>, executive director of the users-producers group, said the phasing out approach probably would mean some CFCs would continue to be in use into the 21st century. `` We will be working with other trade groups around the world trying to line up support'' for a phaseout of <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> production and use, <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> said. Environmentalist groups have suggested 1995 as a target date for ending CFC production. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, co-author of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> analysis, said the failure of computer models to predict past ozone depletion leads <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to shy away from ozone predictions and to zero in on chlorine buildup instead. Any increases in chlorine raise the risk of ozone depletion, he said. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates worldwide atmospheric chlorine at 2.7 parts per billion. Others last year put the figure at 3 parts per billion, which represents about a 25 percent increase in the past decade. By some estimates, half the total comes from natural sources such as sea spray. In the past, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has said an immediate 85 percent reduction in the major <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds would be needed to keep chlorine from rising. But those estimates did not include non-CFC chemicals that yield chlorine, notably methyl chloroform, the most widely used industrial solvent. If use of that compound continues to grow, the current level of chlorine in the atmosphere would triple by 2075, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. Even if the growth of methyl chloroform use was halted, the level of chlorine in the atmosphere would double by 2075, it said. `` An immediate 100 percent reduction in the use of all -LRB- of the most powerful -RRB- compounds and a freeze in methyl chloroform would be needed'' by all countries to stabilize chlorine, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. By `` immediate,'' it said it meant 1990. This would permit use of less powerful <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds to grow throughout the next century while still holding the chlorine increase to less than 1 part per billion by 2100.

<HEAD>Plan For Sunday Ferry Sailings Inflames Hebridean Passions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TARBERT, Outer Hebrides (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There's a whiff of fire and brimstone in the <LOCATION> Outer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hebrides </LOCATION> these days as the islanders of <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> prepare to defend their Sabbath against a ferry invasion from the Scottish mainland. Life is rugged in these treeless, windswept peatlands, and Sunday is the high point of a week otherwise spent fishing, tending sheep and weaving <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> tweed. Pubs and playgrounds close on Sundays, flights are suspended, TV and newspapers are shunned and the only travel is to church. Thus to these flinty Presbyterians, the decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Caledonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MacBrayne </ORGANIZATION> ferry company to begin Sunday sailings next summer is a threat to civilization as they know it. They see tourists and trucks shattering the Sabbath peace. The company has sought to allay these fears by modifying its itinerary so that ferries will sail out but not in, but the islanders say Hebridean harbor staff will still be forced to go to work instead of to church. `` The people of these islands value their principles, their Sunday, their way of life, and we are determined to protect these to the bitter end,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdo </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, a hotelier in <LOCATION> Tarbert </LOCATION>, where the ferry is to dock. But other forces are at work. <PERSON> Calmac </PERSON>, as the ferry company is known, is to be privatized under Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s drive to sell off state-owned industries, and it says that once exposed to market forces, ferries can not lie idle on Sundays Thus the Thatcherite imperatives of free enterprise are bumping up against ancient traditions in what The Sunday Times in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> calls `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s deepest cultural battle.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON>, a fisherman, vows to lead a blockade of <PERSON> Tarbert </PERSON>'s tiny harbor when sailings commence next summer, and <PERSON> Calmac </PERSON>, which has served the Hebrides for more than a century, says it may ask the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to step in <PERSON> Calmac </PERSON>, warns <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, is `` sailing into a horrendous Hebridean hurricane.'' Denunciations have poured forth from the pulpits, and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stornoway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> and Local Advertiser is filled with angry letters. `` Sunday sailors will be cursed,'' writes reader <PERSON> N.M. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>, while <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> MacRae </PERSON> turns to verse: `` The forces of evil are in battle array @ to destroy the Sabbath wherever they may ... We would resolve, as Shadrach of old @ That we will not bow to their image of gold.'' At a time when much of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is jumping through hoops in the chase for tourists, it's refreshing to find a place that is actively fighting to keep them out. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>, head of the Hebridean local authority, concedes that `` some see us as cranky individuals,'' but she believes the cause is just. `` We have a day apart. The mainland of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has no day apart. It suffers from the most appalling problems of urbanization, anti-social behavior, vandalism,'' he said in an interview in his office in <LOCATION> Stornoway </LOCATION>, the Hebridean capital. `` Now why on earth are we going to change by giving up our day apart which we deem to be so precious?'' <ORGANIZATION> Calmac </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Paterson </PERSON> says he understands the islanders' sensitivities, but believes that plenty of islanders want a Sunday service, and he sees nothing unChristian about using it. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> McKibbin </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> Stornoway </LOCATION> businessman and lone voice in favor of Sunday sailings, says the opposition is confined to one segment of the archipelago _ the adjoining islands of <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. On these islands the population of 22,000 is solidly Presbyterian. Further south, on the Uists, <PERSON> Benbecula </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Barra </LOCATION>, the 9,000 islanders are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, Sabbath rules are less stern, and there have been few objections to Sunday sailings. <PERSON> Calmac </PERSON>'s compromise plan entails the ferry leaving <PERSON> Tarbert </PERSON> on Sunday for Uig on the mainland and not returning to <PERSON> Tarbert </PERSON> until Monday. But <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> says it's `` the thin end of a wedge,'' because once the principle is established, Sunday sailings into <PERSON> Tarbert </PERSON> will follow. <PERSON> Paterson </PERSON>, he says, is an Englishman who can not understand the islanders' preoccupations. `` I was born in this village, I was brought up in it, and I intend to make sure that it's not going to be eroded by <PERSON> Sassenachs </PERSON>,'' he said, using the Scottish pejorative for Englishmen. `` You must not become a slave to tourism,'' he said, `` because you lose your identity once that happens.''

 No matter the care taken and the tests conducted, eventually there will be another space accident and the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> probably will once again be the target of the nation's anger and anguish. That, says <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, director of <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, is a truth engineers learn to live with at the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> center that designs and develops the most dangerous parts of a space machine. `` Ours are the two high-risk elements _ the shuttle main engine and the shuttle solid rocket,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said in an interview at the facility in the forested hills of northern <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. `` In 9 chances out of 10, when there is a catastrophic failure, it will rest with those two elements.'' `` When a mission goes good, the focus is going to be on the operations end,'' he said. `` When things go amiss, the attention is going to be right here ... It's not an unfair thing. We're big boys and we know that's the job we've got.'' A presidential commission concluded that the explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed its seven crew members on Jan. 28, 1986, was caused by a flawed solid rocket booster that blowtorched against the external tank. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> engineers became personal targets of blame. Their judgment was ridiculed, their diligence belittled and their competence questioned. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulloy </PERSON>, who headed the solid rocket booster program at <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION>, received hate mail and endured the collapse of a 23-year career at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, director at <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, resigned, with parting, bitter shots at the press. Ten other managers also left, retiring or seeking jobs in private industry. None of the more than 3,400 workers at <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> escaped the stain. `` It was devastating,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON>, an engineer who analyzes stresses on the spacecraft. `` Everybody was pretty low. There was not so much a sense of guilt as of loss. There was also the sense of professional embarrassment. Something had gone terribly wrong and <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> was responsible.'' The drumbeat of blame, recalled <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, an organic chemist and materials expert, seemed to last forever. `` All the nails were driven in place and we were just hanging there and they were still beating on us,'' he said. `` Eventually it got to be too much ... We had accepted the responsibility. What we had to do then was make it right.'' That involved the most massive effort at reevaluation, repair and redesign ever attempted by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. Teams of engineers at <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> dissected every piece of hardware developed at the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> center. Every design was reexamined. Every test was checked over and new ones were ordered where needed. Work days stretched from 10 to 12 to 14 hours, and, for many, weekends were forgotten. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said more tests were made on the main engines and on the solid rocket boosters than were conducted before the shuttle first flew in 1981. The goal was not to find out if the equipment was just `` good enough,'' but to demonstrate that it was better than it had to be. The full-scale solid rocket engine, with a new design for the flawed joint, was fired five times at a test site in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> by its manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. There were hundreds of other firings using sub-scale models or partial propellant loads. In one full-scale test, flaws were intentionally introduced to see if the new rocket had a margin of safety. It was a test never before attempted in the solid rocket industry. `` A lot of people inside and outside the agency did n't like that test because they thought it was pushing the engine too far,'' said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. If it had failed, it could have caused a long delay in shuttle flights. But <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> engineers insisted because, he said, they `` believed in our design and wanted to go out on the test stand and prove it.'' The new rocket engine passed the test with margin to spare. Before Challenger, engineers recalled, dissent against consensus technical views was discouraged. Public differences of opinion were rare and quickly silenced. `` You were part of a team and it seemed a betrayal to take a contrary view,'' said one engineer. Challenger changed that. `` The accident strengthened the hand of the engineers in the trenches,'' said <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON>. `` Before, if you objected to something the manager could say you were overcautious because we had never had an accident. Now if a manager wants to yield to schedule pressures, we tell him that he's on his own.'' The new openness has resulted in conflicts unknown before Challenger. In one case, some experts believed a material in a solid rocket part needed one more test and refused to approve its use despite pressure from a manager. At conferences, it has become common for engineers to stand up and object to positions taken by their own managers. `` You admire a guy who has the courage to take a position different from the crowd,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` But that does n't mean it's a democracy. You're not going to launch with a democracy. You've got to have certain people in the system who make decisions and go.''

<TEXT>
 The nation's welfare system is headed for a major overhaul with the conclusion of complex negotiations on a five-year plan aimed at moving welfare recipients into jobs and helping them collect more child support. The initiative agreed on Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators had been close to death all summer as negotiators sought a balance between conservatives favoring mandatory work and liberals concerned about increasing benefits to the needy and motivating people to enter the mainstream workplace. `` This was a critical day,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the subcommittee that handled the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> welfare bill, emerging from Monday's pivotal meeting. `` There are some who will not be happy'' with the outcome, <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said. But when asked if the package would fly when presented to about 50 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees late this afternoon, he said, `` Yes.'' `` I am very pleased,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees and the Democratic vice presidential nominee. `` I think it's a good final resolution of the differences ... an excellent compromise.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s domestic policy adviser, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>, a participant in Monday's meeting, offered a conditional endorsement of the compromise. `` If it's okay with the conferees and if it comes down the way I understand it, it's probably okay,'' he said. The $ 3.34 billion welfare plan comes in above the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s own $ 2.8 billion measure but would cost less than half of the initial $ 7.1 billion plan passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The cornerstone of the compromise is a Job Opportunities and Basic Skills -LRB- JOBS -RRB- program offering welfare parents _ including those with preschool children _ services such as job search help, education and job training. Child care and transportation aid would be available to participants. States would have to be serving 7 percent of eligible welfare recipients by 1990 and 20 percent by 1995. States would be given $ 600 million for the JOBS program in 1989, rising to $ 1.3 billion in 1995. People moving into jobs would qualify for a year of transitional child care and Medicaid benefits. Twenty-seven states now provide welfare benefits to households with two unemployed parents. The welfare bill would require those states to continue and, effective in 1991, would require others to provide at least six months of benefits a year to such families. Starting in 1994, one adult in each two-parent welfare family would have to perform 16 hours a week of community work, on-the-job training or other specified work activities. People under 25 without high school diplomas would be able to substitute participation in an education program leading to a diploma or its equivalent. The bill also makes new demands on states to step up child support collections from non-custodial parents, including tougher paternity determination requirements and mandatory wage withholding upon the court award of support payments. The 16-hour-a-week work requirement would affect only about 7 percent of the welfare caseload but was a primary obstacle to achieving agreement on the overall bill. A handful of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> liberals resisted the provision almost as fiercely as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration insisted it be retained.

 <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON>, maker of the rocket booster that caused Challenger's destruction, hopes a successful launch for Discovery will begin an awakening from a 32-month-long corporate nightmare. It will be the `` final demonstration to our customer <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the country that solid rocket motors are going to be a reliable contributor to future shuttle successes,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, vice president and assistant general manager of space operations at <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wasatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Less easily dispatched are the specters of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation, lawsuits by frustrated former employees and a plague of rocket fuel-related accidents, including an MX missile motor fire that killed five employees last December. The presidential commission that investigated the Jan. 28, 1986, shuttle disaster found that an O-ring seal on the right booster rocket had stiffened in freezing pre-launch temperatures, allowing superheated gas to escape and trigger an explosion. Worse, the commission learned that several <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> engineers had argued the night before that just such a disaster could occur, but were overruled by superiors who told <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> the launch should proceed. In the relentless glare of the postmortem, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> embarked on an exhaustive booster redesign that kept some 3,000 workers busy on the field joints as well as the case-to-nozzle motor joint, the nozzle assembly and hundreds of smaller components. `` It's been a very difficult period,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` I do n't think any company is ever prepared for the kind of intense scrutiny that you get following a tragedy like Challenger. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> engineer who had argued against the Challenger launch, was made vice president of engineering for space operations _ overseer of the booster redesign. His guiding principle in the $ 500 million effort has been redundancy: multiple seals, bolts and clamps to contain the 1.1 million pounds of solid fuel that burn in just two minutes. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has borne the redesign cost and <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> agreed to reap no profit. Engineers have conducted five $ 20 million full-scale test-firings of the redesigned boosters, as well as hundreds of sub-scale and component tests. A sixth full-scale test is planned for December. With 8,000 employees and an annual payroll of $ 220 million, <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s largest private employer. The Chicago-based company also produces munitions, salt and specialty chemicals, and manufactures first-stage motors for the MX, Trident 2 and Midgetman strategic missiles and propulsion systems for tactical missiles. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, a company vice president, said aerospace profits _ which account for more than a quarter of the company's overall profits _ fell from $ 96 million in fiscal 1986 to $ 73 million in 1987, then rose to $ 80.8 million in 1988. Even as <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> struggled to recover from Challenger, accidents further begrimed its public image. On Dec. 29, 1987, five men were killed when 108,000 pounds of fuel in an MX missile segment exploded, destroying a $ 6.2 million building at the complex 75 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The state cited <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> for six safety violations. Just last week, the company acknowledged that an old model of a nozzle inlet ring had been used in a motor test-fired in August. Analysis proved new versions had been placed in Discovery's boosters <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> also has been sued by former employees, among them <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>, another engineer who protested the Challenger launch and later resigned. His lawsuits, seeking $ 3 billion, were recently dismissed. In mid-September, two former consultants, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Agee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Laine </PERSON>, filed suit contending they were fired for attempting to bring redesign problems to light.

<HEAD>Democrat Loss On Wage Bill Means No Hike This Year In Minimum Pay

 Some 4.7 million Americans will have to wait at least another year for the first raise in the $ 3.35-an-hour minimum wage since 1981 as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> concede a major election-year legislative defeat to a Republican filibuster. Refusing to bow to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> demands for a broad-based subminimum floor under the 50-year-old minimum wage, Democratic leaders on Monday gave up all hope of raising the pay base by 40 cents to $ 3.75 an hour in January. `` There is no point in our continuing to pound on their door,'' Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` I'm now conceding that the Republican filibuster was successful.'' Even before Monday's action, the bill faced an uncertain fate in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where there was intense opposition from some southern and midwestern Democrats. `` I think it's a pretty good result,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` This bill could n't pass the House. It was n't going to pass the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> unless it was modified.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had been stymied for more than a week by parliamentary maneuvering on both sides as the two presidential candidates, Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, watched from the sidelines. Lacking the 51 votes to effectively couple an increase with their desire for a 90-day, 80 percent subminimum for newly hired workers, Republicans refused to allow any votes on the bill itself or amendments. Democrats, meanwhile, lacked the 60 votes necessary to limit the debate and shut off the filibuster despite the defection of eight <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators to their cause last Friday. Each side sought to blame the other, with Democrats maintaining that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could have turned the vote around with a few phone calls to Republican lawmakers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> three weeks ago had said he could support a modest increase _ never specifying how much _ but only if it was coupled with the creation of a broad subminimum `` training'' wage. `` Perhaps the word from the vice president's campaign has not gotten through to our friends on the other side,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` Perhaps it has gotten through. Either way the results are evident. Some 15 million workers are the loser.'' The bill, sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., would have raised the minimum wage in three annual 40-cents-an-hour increases to $ 4.55 by 1991, directly benefiting some 15 million workers now paid less than that, according to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> Republicans blamed <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s refusal to compromise on a lower figure, such as the $ 4.25 an hour suggested once by <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> or $ 4 an hour as urged by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind. But they said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s refusal to compromise on the so-called training wage, or the `` youth training wage'' as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> called it, overshadowed everything else. `` The real reason this is being pulled down is that the senator from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> knows we were on the very edge of passing the training wage,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, the leader of the Republican opposition. `` The fact is that the international trade union movement in this country will not accept a training wage,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. `` They consider the minimum wage as their single idea.'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> had introduced an amendment calling for the 80 percent subminimum for the first 90 days a new employee is on a company's payroll, saying it would `` give a chance to those unskilled, undereducated youths who can not get into the system any other way. To prevent a vote on the amendment, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> immediately introduced a substitute that would slightly expand a currently allowed but little-used $ 2.85 subminimum for full-time students working less than 20 hours a week. `` If his passes, mine would be gone,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said early in the debate, complaining as did other Republicans that their subminimum proposal was being denied a fair hearing under <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules that favor whichever party holds a majority. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> called <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>'s subminimum amendment a `` Bush hire'em and fire'em wage.'' Without any requirements for training or age restrictions, employers would have an incentive to replace their workforces every 90 days with a new group of workers paid the subminimum rate, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. Republicans had also pushed as an alternative to a minimum wage increase an earned income tax credit that would have funneled about $ 6 billion in federal subsidies over four years to families headed by minimum wage earners. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said that alternative, which Republicans conceded would have to be financed through a tax increase, would leave taxpayers `` subsidizing employers who exploit their workers.''

 The tobacco industry is mounting an expensive campaign to try to snuff out an <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> ballot measure that would create the nation's toughest anti-smoking law. But opponents of Measure 6 will have their work cut out for them because a recent statewide poll found strong public support for it. Tobacco companies are using mass mailings of brochures, newsletters and voter registration kits in hopes of scuttling Measure 6 on the Nov. 8 ballot. `` We're going to spend a lot of money,'' at least several hundred thousand dollars, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> lobbyist who's running the campaign to defeat Measure 6 `` We're going to make a major effort on this.'' The anti-smoking proposal would toughen the 1981 Oregon Indoor Clean Air Act, which makes most public buildings off limits to smokers, except in designated smoking areas. The new proposal, if approved, would wipe out designated smoking areas and ban smoking in virtually all indoor work areas and enclosed places frequented by the public. Violators would be subject to civil penalties of up to $ 250. Smoking still would be allowed in bars and taverns, tobacco stores, and hotel and motel rooms. The <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> led a petition drive to win a spot on the ballot for the proposal. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Odisio </PERSON>, who is coordinating the campaign for the <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said non-smokers should not have to put up with secondhand smoke in public facilities or workplaces. `` What we're talking about is a public health measure,'' <PERSON> Odisio </PERSON> said. `` We know that secondhand smoke causes disease, including lung cancer in otherwise healthy non-smokers.'' `` Study after study has shown unhealthful levels of tobacco smoke in non-smoking sections,'' she said. That is disputed by <PERSON> Maura </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's no substantive, scientific support for the contention that environmental tobacco smoke causes any significant threat to the health of non-smokers,'' she said. In a telephone interview from the company's office in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> called Measure 6 a dangerous abridgement of the rights of a minority group _ smokers. `` Even if you're a non-smoker, you should be careful of government infringement on other people's rights,'' she said. `` Maybe next they're going to try to restrict whether people eat red meat or attend rock concerts that neighbors find too noisy.'' A former <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, voices similar concerns about possible infringement of civil liberties. In a letter distributed by opponents of Measure 6, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> warned that it would `` authorize search warrants to root out evidence of illegal smoking, and even bring about police arrests of fine-ignoring citizens.'' <PERSON> Odisio </PERSON> dismisses those concerns as unfounded, saying no one has been fined or taken to court for violating the current law. `` It's a self-enforcing law,'' <PERSON> Odisio </PERSON> said. `` It is passed with the understanding that most <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> citizens are law-abiding.'' She said 42 states have some sort of statewide restriction on smoking, including such things as banning smoking on elevators, and that 36 of those restrict smoking in a wide variety of public places with designated smoking or non-smoking areas. The proposed <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> law, she said, would be the first to drop all designated areas. Other groups pitching in to try to defeat the measure are the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, and the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Restaurant and <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bowling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, said Measure 6 would hurt his industry because a lot of bowlers are smokers. `` If they would not be allowed to smoke for that two-hour period, they would drop out of the sport altogether or cut down on the number of times they bowl,'' he said. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> estimated bowling alleys would lose at least 10 percent of their customers if Measure 6 passes, and argued that the existing law has been a success in providing separate accommodations for smokers and non-smokers. <PERSON> Odisio </PERSON> said the proposal is part of a nationwide trend. `` It's just a case of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> being one small step in front of everybody else,'' she said. `` We're not way out in left field, we just happen to be at the front of the parade.'' A poll conducted for The Oregonian newspaper in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> Sept. 6-7 asked 400 registered voters how they would vote on several measures that will be on the statewide ballot. Measure 6 was favored by 62 percent of those surveyed in the telephone poll and opposed by 36 percent. The rest were undecided. The margin of error was 4.9 percent.

 Now come the vice presidential nominees in a different kind of debate _ a confrontation in which Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will be out to prove that he does n't deserve to be a campaign issue. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Republican running mate and Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for vice president, meet on Oct. 5 in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, in a 90-minute debate patterned on the match between the presidential nominees. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s competence has come under almost daily challenge from Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and lately, from <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. The patrician <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has shelved senatorial courtesy in favor of long-distance attacks on his cross-aisle colleague from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. And <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate etiquette presumably will not apply next week, at least on <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s side of the stage. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 41, a second-term senator, could try to deflect debate attacks by using the elaborate courtesies of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in handling his senior colleague. Debating <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Sunday night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave a hint at that strategy by saying that he, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> were the only three candidates in the race who are knowledgeable on defense issues. Campaign debaters customarily are out to raise their profiles, to promote themselves and their positions as issues to be considered by the voters. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> could best serve his ticket by reversing that with a solid, error-free debate showing, nothing flashy or fancy, just a workmanlike performance to try to silence the critics _ and lower his profile as a Democratic target. Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, testy when he was questioned about criticism of his chosen running mate in the presidential debate, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who is 41, is an outstanding young man who has stood up to `` outrageous, brutal ... very unfair pounding ...'' since his nomination. `` He'll do very, very well'' in the debate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The Democrats think <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a salable campaign issue for their side, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> takes a slap at him in almost every speech. `` I doubt very much that <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was the best qualified person for that job,'' he said Sunday night. `` And as a matter of fact, I think for most people, the notion of President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a very, very troubling notion.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, campaigning with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, returned the gibe. `` After last night, for most people the notion of President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a very, very troubling notion today,'' he said. With the Democrats questioning his competence, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is in a position to succeed without really scoring in the vice presidential debate, if he can hold his own and undercut the opposition claim that he is in way over his head. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> can do that by showing the voters that he is n't a dummy, that he can answer questions under the pressure of a nationally-televised debate without misspeaking, that he is up to his assignment. The best vice presidential candidates are those who serve as spokesmen and campaigners for their nominees but do n't make waves. The people running to be No. 2 tend to attract the most attention when they err, or when their records come under critical scrutiny. Both have been happening in <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s case, ever since the question of family influence in his Vietnam-era <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> enlistment blew up into controversy just as he was nominated at the Republican National Convention. Four years ago, Rep. <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>'s family income taxes and her husband's business affairs became a focus of inquiry and thus a problem for the Democratic ticket on which she ran. In 1976, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s debate remark that World War I, World War II, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> were `` all Democrat wars'' created a troublesome issue for the Republican ticket. Once such questions become issues, they tend to snowball. For <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the Guard uproar was followed by questions about his admittedly mediocre college record, and his admission into night law school. Errors in his campaign statements have since been added to the dossier, things like his tongue-twisted effort to say that a good defense beats a good offense _ or was it the other way around _ and his slip in saying that he did n't live in this century. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took it from there. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has called the Republican record on energy `` as empty as <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s resume.'' Acknowledging that he and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> differ on some issues, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that is healthy. `` What would have happened if <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had a vice president like <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>; a vice president strong enough to think for himself and speak up for himself ...?'' he asks his campaign crowds. `` We have n't had that kind of vice president for the past eight years, and I do n't know of anyone who thinks we'll have him in the person of <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' The name has become a laughter and applause line at Democratic rallies. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> draws it out slowly, scornfully, and sometimes his supporters recite it with him. In their debate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rebuked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for ridiculing the name and said the original <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> was killed in World War II. Full name or nickname, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has become a target, and his problems are taking a Republican toll. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirthlin </PERSON>, who conducts public opinion polls for the White House and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, says the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> nomination thus far has been more negative than positive for the ticket, with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> viewed as the stronger nominee. `` The question is to what extent do people vote for the ticket because of the vice president,'' <PERSON> Wirthlin </PERSON> said. `` In the past, that has not been a big issue.'' The Democrats are campaigning to make it one this time. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s best opportunity to block them comes next week in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> have been negotiating plans for a `` white pride day'' rally at Independence Hall in November, a park official says. The park service expects to approve an application for a permit to hold the rally at the hall, where the Declaration of Independence and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution were signed, Chief Ranger <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Burn </PERSON> said Monday. The application has not been filed yet, but will be soon, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>, a Klan official who lives in <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. For the past two weeks, the <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> and the park service have been discussing police protection, parking and other concerns associated with the rally scheduled for Nov. 5 at the hall, <PERSON> Burn </PERSON> said Burn said the application probably would be approved because `` under the First Amendment and the regulations we operate under, there's not much room for denying -LRB- it -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an executive board member of the Philadlephia branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, agreed the Constitution gives the <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> the right to rally. But, she said, `` It is sad to see that people who have accepted violence as a way of life toward people who are not their race or creed can imbue others with their hatred. `` I do hope there will be some black faces there,'' she said.

<HEAD>October Is AIDS Prevention, Awareness Month</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With more Americans aware of AIDS than ever before, federal health officials are urging the nation's governors and clergy to emphasize prevention during October _ AIDS Prevention and Awareness Month. A similar designation was made last October, when a flashy broadcast, print and direct mail advertising campaign was launched. Many of those television spots _ all identified by the phrase `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> Responds to AIDS'' _ still are running and are tied in with a pamphlet called `` Understanding AIDS'' that was mailed to every <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> household last spring. `` Despite efforts such as this, we need to keep alerting the public about AIDS,'' <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said in a recent letter asking each of the nation's governors to declare October AIDS Prevention and Education Month. A survey issued last month by the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> shows Americans now consider AIDS to be the most serious problem facing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In January 1987, AIDS had ranked ninth. `` The widespread media attention focused on the AIDS dilemma is obviously being heard across the country,'' said <PERSON> Fabian </PERSON> <PERSON> Linden </PERSON>, executive director of the board's <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The survey was conducted for the non-profit, business-supported group by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which polled 5,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> households. `` In a sense the department ... has been successful in making the public aware about the fact that AIDS is a danger, but obviously we still have the problem of making sure people are heeding the prevention aspect of it,'' <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in a recent interview. While 73,394 Americans had been diagnosed with AIDS as of Sept. 19, thousands more are known to be in earlier stages of the disease and the government estimates that up to 1.5 million people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are infected with the AIDS-causing virus. Because of growing data about the disease's long incubation period, medical experts are increasingly fearful that most, if not virtually all, of those infected eventually will become sick and die of AIDS. In letters to members of the clergy, distributed through central offices of the nation's churches and denominations, <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> and other top <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> officials asked the religious leaders to set aside the third weekend of October to `` relay potentially lifesaving messages about AIDS.'' `` Such a message could be as simple as urging your congregation to call the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s National AIDS Hotline ... but we hope you will want to talk to your congregation at greater length about this topic of such extraordinary importance to us all,'' said the letter, also signed by Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Windom </PERSON>, the assistant <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> secretary for health. Enclosed with the letter were sample questions and answers about AIDS. Not mentioned in the material sent to priests, rabbis and ministers was the health service's position that condoms can be a barrier, although not 100 percent effective, against passing the infection during sexual contact. Another part of this year's more focused October campaign is letters to university presidents and deans along with a videotape for college students entitled `` AIDS: Why Should I Care?'' In a letter to the deans, <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> said one-fifth of the AIDS cases reported so far `` have occurred among people 20 to 29 years old. `` Since the average incubation period ... is seven years or longer, it's clear that any of the ... 14,000-plus patients in this group were high school or college age at the time of their infection,'' said <PERSON> Windom </PERSON>. `` We must leave no stone unturned in teaching students about the potential risks posed by AIDS and how they can avoid them,'' he wrote. The video includes appearances by such well-known performers as <PERSON> Dionne </PERSON> <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nell </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>.

 Congressional and administration officials are close to a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending compromise that would remove one of the last major obstacles to passage of all legislation needed to pay the government's bills by the Oct. 1 start of a new fiscal year. The two sides are near agreement on the complicated <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> measure, according to congressional sources who declined to be identified Monday. The proposed compromise would remove some of the restrictions imposed earlier by the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s cherished Star Wars anti-missile defense plan, the sources said But overall, the Strategic Defense Initiative, as the program is formally known, still would receive $ 4.1 billion, the same amount that was in the bill <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed on Aug. 3, the sources said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had sought $ 4.8 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, compared to the $ 3.9 billion the program now receives. Approval of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> bill is the major remaining hurdle to be cleared before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> finishes work on all 13 appropriations bills needed to finance the government starting Saturday. The last time all 13 spending bills were finished by the start of the new fiscal year was 1948. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leaders are pushing to finish the bills and avoid giving the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a potentially embarrassing election-year issue. After yearlong budget battles, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sent the president a 1,400-page, $ 600 billion catchall spending bill last December, nearly three months into the present fiscal year. In <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s State of the Union address, he threatened to veto any similar giant spending bills this year, and scores of lawmakers signed letters pledging to support him. This year's appropriations work was made easier by the budget summit agreement between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders last November. That pact settled many broad spending questions for fiscal 1989, but disputes over various provisions within several individual bills have caused delays. Lawmakers have said the dispute over the defense bill was the most serious and that its resolution would make it likely that all 13 bills would be finished on time. Many Democrats fear that if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does not finish its appropriations work on time this year, the president and Republicans will use that failure to paint the majority party as inefficient and incapable of adhering to budget processes. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has thus far signed four appropriations bills and two others have been sent to his desk. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending compromise also drops a restriction added by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on testing of depressed-trajectory missiles, a type of atomic-tipped weapon being developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, the sources said. The bill provides $ 300 billion for all <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending, the same as the earlier bill. That would be a slight decrease from the current $ 302 billion <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Estranged Husband's Effort To Block Abortion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has let stand <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> court rulings that a woman has a constitutional right to end her pregnancy despite her husband's objections. Without comment or recorded dissent, the justices on Monday denied an emergency request by the estranged husband of <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, that she be prevented from having an abotion. In August, Mrs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> told her husband, <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>, she was seven or eight weeks pregnant and intended to have an abortion. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> immediately went to court to prevent it. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s highest court had rejected the husband's action, but appointed a guardian for the fetus until 5 p.m. Monday to allow time to seek emergency help from Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, who handles emergency appeals from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> for the nation's highest court. <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> referred the request to the full <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which denied it. Three other <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> members _ Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> _ rejected similar emergency requests to stop abortions earlier this year. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, said the husband was upset by the verdict. `` That's his baby and he wants it,'' <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was `` happy and relieved,'' said attorney <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Spivack </PERSON>. She did not know when the 24-year-old woman would have the planned abortion. Mrs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> has refused to discuss the case. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of Terre Haute, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, the lawyer who had filed an emergency appeal on behalf of the fetus, said he planned to file a further appeal by the end of the week. `` I'm hoping that they'll hear it on merits,'' said <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON>. `` They did n't decide the case on merits. They just denied the stay. We lost part, but we did n't lose all.'' <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> had asked that Mrs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> be kept from having an abortion until the full <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> considers a formal appeal. In the appeal, <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> urged the court to overturn its landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion. `` We're very pleased for <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> chapter. `` Our job was to protect her right to choose, whether that choice is to carry that pregnancy to term or terminate her pregnancy.'' If the situation were reversed and a woman wanted to carry a pregnancy to term against her husband's wishes, the case never would have gone all the way to the highest court in the land, he said. `` Nobody would have thought he had a right to force her to have an abortion if she did n't want one,'' he said. `` The consistent principle is respect for each person's dignity.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> filed for divorce last January. The couple had a brief reconciliation but have said they want to continue divorce proceedings. A <LOCATION> Genesee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> trial judge barred Mrs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> from having an abortion, but a state appeals court threw out the judge's order. The <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last Thursday said it was not `` persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this court.'' The cases are <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, A-240, and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, A-244.

 A bill that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says is a good way to help the homeless is drawing flak from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which argues that some of its provisions are duplicative and ineffective. In a statement distributed Monday, the administration's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> said that portions of the so-called <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> bill `` duplicate existing programs'' and are so complex that they `` do not effectively address the needs of this population.'' In his debate Sunday with Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that to help the nation's homeless people, the government should `` fully fund the McKinney Act. The legislation was initially signed into law on July 22, 1987, after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> railed about the measure's expense and `` duplicative programs.'' The law created programs worth $ 1.1 billion over the last two years for housing, health care, education, job training and other help for the nation's homeless people. Legislation authorizing $ 1.3 billion worth of expenditures for the next two years is working its way through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In its statement, <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> said it favored the bill's programs for emergency food and shelter and for transitional housing. But the agency said the administration opposes parts of the bill which would give bonuses to states that place welfare recipients in jobs, would eliminate some rental assistance, and would pay salaries for state workers who coordinate homeless activities. The statement did not, however, contain any threat to veto the bill. When the original version of the legislation passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on a 264-121 vote on March 5, 1987, all but eight of the votes cast against it were by Republicans. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers argued that the easure would increase the federal deficit, and was so generous that it might worsen the problem by encouraging even more people to live in the streets. Passage came two nights after a highly publicized `` Grate American Sleep-Out,'' in which several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> joined homeless advocate <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> and actor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> for an evening sleeping on a grate two blocks from the Capitol. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a less expensive version of the bill on a voice vote a month later. Housing advocates have been disappointed with the results of the legislation. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has consistently sought _ and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has provided _ actual spending levels far below the amounts permitted in the bill. For the first two years of the law, for example, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriated only $ 700 million out of a possible $ 1.1 billion. The money provided under the legislation was largely distributed to non-profit agencies and to state and local governments. It has been used to provide emergency food and shelter, to purchase and rehabilitate group homes, to pay for health and education programs, to help tenants pay rent, and for other projects. The measure was named after the late Rep. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., one of the legislation's original sponsors <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> died May 7, 1987. Estimates of the number of homeless in the country range between 250,000 to 3 million people.

 Those great pop songs of the early 1960s will survive `` Suds,'' a numbing regurgitation of many of the musical hits of the era when the Beatles were changing the sound of popular music. There are some terrific musical memories including `` Respect,'' `` Dedicated to the One I Love,'' `` The Loco-Motion,'' `` Do <PERSON> Wah </PERSON> <PERSON> Diddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Diddy </PERSON>,'' `` You Don ` t Have to Say You Love Me,'' `` You Ca n't Hurry Love'' and nearly 40 other Top 10 tunes crammed into the show What sinks `` Suds'' is not the songs but the dippy story that authors <PERSON> Melinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilb </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> have inflicted on these golden oldies. It's dumb without being fun. They have set their musical in a Laundromat where <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>, the world's oldest looking teen-ager, is celebrating her birthday _ alone and depressed. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>'s cat, Fluffy, has been run over by a Corvair, her pen pal boyfriend has dropped her because he found someone with better handwriting and she discovers she owes $ 10,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for some relative's back taxes. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> tries to end it all by wrapping pedal pushers around her neck, throwing them into a <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> and agitating herself to death. She's stopped by two guardian angels, one named <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> who looks like <PERSON> Marlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> on a bad day and the other, <PERSON> Marge </PERSON>, whose red bouffant hairdo confirms she has cornered the market on hairspray. The duo counsel the girl, trying to cheer her up and persuade her to get on with her life. It's these therapeutic sessions that take the form of musical interludes, usually three or four hit numbers stitched together. Occasionally, they take off, like a funny version of `` Secret Agent Man,'' done with style by <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>, who plays all the men and even one woman in the show. More often, you grow impatient with the dialogue, waiting for the story to end and the music to begin again. The cast is competent but not distinguished. The women _ <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevec </PERSON>, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gilb </PERSON> _ belt out the songs with gusto if not any particular style. `` Suds,'' which opened last weekend, is the first attraction at Stage Left, a cabaret theater in the Criterion Center. The Center is an impressive theater complex located in Times Square and also contains a more formal theater which will open later in the year. The playing area has good sightlines and comfortable seating. Now all it needs is a show.

 Things have turned nasty in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race where Democratic incumbent <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opponent already has called his rival a liar, a coward and a crummy boss <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, a two-term <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> veteran, is known to most of the world as a professorial type who writes a lot of books, taught at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and served as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. But Republican <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> is hoping to expose another side of <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> using an aggressive campaign with sharp personal attacks, and, in the process, salvage an underfunded and underpublicized effort to unseat <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>. It's a long shot gamble. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> claims, is an arrogant and overrated senator who was `` chicken'' to debate him, condones `` safe sodomy'' for homosexuals, lies to the press, is too abrasive to keep employees on his staff and too lazy to do his official duties in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` What kind of a man is this <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> asked last month. `` He's on the record as one who would lie, if he thought he could get away with it.'' <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, 61, has tried to appear above the fray in the face of <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>'s charges. When asked about being called a liar, <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said only, `` I heard that. That's OK. I've been called worse things than that.'' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, 56, a wealthy <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> lawyer who worked for President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in the 1960s, also maintains that <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> has n't been the kind of `` shining beacon'' to the youth of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> recalls from his adolescent days in front of the radio He suggested <PERSON> Flash </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, the Lone Ranger, Captain Midnight or <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> as good role models. Many attribute the tone of <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>'s campaign to one of its chief strategists, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blasdell </PERSON>, who once worked with campaign expert <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>. An influential voice in Republican nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential effort, <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> is known for his bare-knuckles campaign style. <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>'s attacks have n't had a discernible effect among voters, but they have prompted <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> campaign aide <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to suggest that New Yorkers might be owed an apology `` for the nonsense they've been subjected to by this candidacy.'' `` This is what comes from desperation,'' <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said of <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>'s tactics. `` There's a very cold, calculated decision being made to go after <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> the person. And that, you'll find in a state where <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> has a 70 percent approval rating, is the most egregious tactical mistake the opposition campaign could ever have. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> won 65 percent of the vote en route to his defeat of little-known <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> state Assemblywoman <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sullivan </LOCATION> in 1982 by more than 1.5 million votes. A poll conducted earlier this month by the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, showed him with a 63-21 percent lead over <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> among 601 likely voters. Financially, <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> has little hope of matching <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> in spending. The most recent contribution filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>'s campaign $ 40,000 in debt while <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> had $ 1.9 million in the bank. Since starting his campaign May 9, <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> has been on the road almost constantly, appearing at county fairs, political picnics and local television and radio stations. He has logged about 27,000 miles by car. In that time, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate has tried to prove that <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>'s intellectual bent has n't paid dividends for New Yorkers since the former <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> professor won election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1976. <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> says <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> has exercised `` benign neglect'' toward New Yorkers as senator. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> says `` I plead guilty'' about his enthusiasm for writing and lecturing, but insists that one of his senatorial duties is to articulate the issues. And, <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> says <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> has been responsible for delivering about $ 5 billion in federal aid to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in his second term alone. <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> has also tried to make political hay by pointing out that <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> has missed more than 400 roll call votes since arriving in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> says that when first elected, he promised only to do better than the senatorial average as far as attendance in the House was concerned. He said he's done that by being present for about 92 percent of the votes. <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> leveled the liar charge in connection with an incident last year when a <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> -RRB- News reporter challenged <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> on why he had been excluded from a Moynihan press briefing. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> denied that he'd ordered the reporter barred, but <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> chief of staff <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainie </PERSON> said his boss had indeed given orders to keep the reporter out. <PERSON> Rainie </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reporter, resigned a few days later. `` One day of staff confusion,'' said <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> of the incident.

<HEAD>$206 Million Farm Research Bill Gets House Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An agricultural research bill to provide $ 206 million for programs ranging from alternative crops to fish farming is headed for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> after winning approval in the House. `` The land is the only thing that can produce new wealth for this vast economic empire we call the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and it begins with research,'' Agriculture Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said Monday as the bill received <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approval on a voice vote. Research grants to develop new types of crop production would be authorized by the bill. The measure also would establish a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alternative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> within the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. A non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercialization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> also would be created that would use loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies and other means to spur product commercialization. Under the measure, $ 20 million a year through fiscal year 2000 would be authorized for development of new agricultural products, $ 15 million to commercialize products and up to $ 600,000 to enhance marketing of existing ones. The bill's overall price tag was estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> at $ 206 million over five years. With perhaps three weeks to go before lawmakers adjourn, however, the future of the measure is clouded. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has offered no guarantees that it will get to the measure. The bill would establish grants for research into statistical methods of measuring chemicals and microorganisms in food products and means of preventing contamination. Also under the measure, an office of groundwater policy determination would be established within the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. That provision was included at the urging of Republican Rep. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where concern is growing over findings of pesticide contamination in groundwater. The bill would provide $ 3 million in each of three years for research into aquaculture, or fish farming. It also would reauthorize federal research aid for examination and development of crops used in so-called critical materials. The measure would set the program at an $ 8 million level for each of the next two years. Most money under that program would go to research into guayule _ a plant grown in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> that produces a natural rubber that can be used for high-performance aircraft tires. The bill would enable farmers to plant so-called alternative crops in 1989 and 1990 without losing their base acreage listed with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. The base acreage is used to calculate the size of the federal payments they get for producing wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved on a voice vote a separate measure to establish a 25-member Commission on the Improvement of the Federal Crop Insurance Program. Ten of the 21 voting members would come from the insurance industry and 10 from among agricultural producers with the manager of the corporation also serving on the panel. The four non-voting members would come from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The goal of the panel would be to recommend changes in the program, which has lost more than $ 1 billion since 1980 when a major overhaul was approved.

 Residents are concerned about a rock maple tree that provided a shady spot for poet <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilmer </PERSON>, who may have been inspired by it when he wrote `` I think that I shall never see a poem as lovely as a tree.'' The hospital on whose grounds the tree sits has announced it is closing after 88 years. `` It would be too bad if something happened to that tree, but you never know with the hospital going and all,'' said Sister <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> of the Sisters of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> order, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Farren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Local historians say the grand old maple inspired the <PERSON> Kilmer </PERSON> poem memorized by millions of schoolchildren on Arbor Days past.

The poet is said to have stayed in a large house on the north side of the hospital, according to <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulin </PERSON>, retired director of engineering, who worked at the hospital for 55 years.

 The number of working Americans with wages below the poverty level for a family of four increased by more than 1 million last year, according to a new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> report. The report, prepared by the Democratic staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> data, concluded that both high-paying and low-paying jobs have grown at the expense of a shrinking middle class over the past eight years. Fueling the debate over the quality of 16 million new jobs since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office, the report was immediately criticized by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> as `` misleading and inaccurate.'' `` Sixty-four percent of American jobs paid middle level wages -LRB- defined as those between $ 11,611 and $ 46,444 in 1987 dollars -RRB- in 1979,'' said the report, released Monday. `` Between the peak of the business cycle in 1979 and the latest year of the current expansion in 1987, only 38 percent of the increase in employment was in middle wage jobs,'' it added. As a result, according to the data, the share of middle-wage earners declined from 64 percent to 61.3 percent between 1979 and 1987. Those earning a poverty wage climbed from 32.4 percent to 34.2 percent and those with high wages -LRB- more than $ 46,444 -RRB- rose from 3.7 percent to 4.5 percent of the working population. The committee's chairman, retiring Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said a comparison of the 1987 data from the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s Current Population Survey released earlier this month with 1986 data shows a worsening of the trend According to the data, 40.45 million workers were paid a full-time equivalent of less than $ 11,611 last year, compared with 39.38 million in 1986. Meanwhile, the number of Americans with jobs exceeding $ 46,444 fell from 5.4 million in 1986 to 5.32 million last year. `` The sad truth,'' <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> said, `` is that jobs paying below the poverty level are growing faster than any other kind. And jobs that provide a middle-class standard of living are a shrinking part of our job landscape.'' Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the committee's ranking Republican and former chairman, called the report `` opportunistic, political, misleading and inaccurate'' and predicted that it eventually will be discredited. `` Most of the new jobs created during the expansion have been in occupations that pay well _ in technical and managerial fields, the kind of jobs we want for our kids,'' he said. `` Only 8 percent of the jobs generated by this expansion pay under $ 7,000 annually.'' The only group going against the trend was women, according to the report. Middle-wage and high-wage jobs among them increased by 1.2 percentage points and 0.5 percentage points to 55.4 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively, over the past eight years. The share of women in the workforce with low-paying jobs, meanwhile, fell from 44.6 percent in 1979 to 42.9 percent last year. Men fared the worst, with the middle-income share falling from 72.1 percent in 1979 to 66.6 percent last year. The share of low-wage earners among men climbed from 22.3 percent to 26.5 percent over the same period while the proportion of high-wage earners rose from 5.6 percent to 6.9 percent. Among blacks and other minorities, the share of low-income workers and high-income earners increased by 1.2 percentage points and 0.6 percentage points to 41.7 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. The proportion of middle-income minority workers declined from 57.8 percent to 56 percent over the eight years.

<HEAD>TV Ads To Feature Closing Statement, Health Care Pitch From Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has already turned his closing statement from the first presidential debate into a tag line for two campaign commercials that begin airing tonight. `` The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not behind us, the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says in both 30-second spots. One, called `` Opportunity,'' includes only the closing lines from his Sunday night debate with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. The other, `` Our Concern,'' focuses on his pitch for universal health insurance, but also mentions college opportunity and includes the closing line. The length of the run has not been determined, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Voles </PERSON> said Monday. `` We have an opportunity, working together, to build that future, to build a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to build a best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at the close of the debate in a passage also frequently found in his stump speeches. `` Because the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't hide; we compete,'' he continued. `` The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't waste; we invest. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't leave some of its citizens behind; we bring everyone along. And the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not behind us. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come.'' The health care pitch focuses on the Democratic nominee's promise to seek legislation requiring most employers to provide health insurance to their workers `` I think it's time that when you got a job in this country that it came with health insurance,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says in the debate footage. The passage from the closing statement was chosen for an ad because it focuses on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' effort to win broad support among middle class voters _ a segment <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has characterized as victims of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recovery. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides had planned to use at least one segment from the debate, and likely the closing statement, for a new ad and then also decided to make a second ad with the health care material, campaign aides said.

<HEAD>Government Analysts Say Food Aid To Poor Nations May Fall Further</HEAD>

 Food aid to needy countries has dropped and could fall further because of rising commodity prices, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts. The Food and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> agency, estimates that aid in the form of cereal grain shipments in the 12 months ended June 30 was about 10.5 million metric tons, down 14 percent from 12.2 million tons a year earlier. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Nightingale </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provided 65 percent of last year's 10.5 million tons and `` was followed distantly'' by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> with 15 percent; <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, 10 percent; and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, each with about 3 percent. For the fourth consecutive year, he said, the 1974 <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> goal of 10 million tons of food aid was exceeded last year. `` However, given no significant increases in the major donors' 1988-89 food-aid budgets, and higher commodity prices, the volume of food aid may fall in 1988-89, and achievement of the 10-million-ton-goal is doubtful,'' <PERSON> Nightingale </PERSON> said The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid program under Food for Peace, or P.L. 480 as it is also known, was increased nearly 5 percent for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 to nearly $ 1.5 billion. Nightingale, writing in the October issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine, said about two-thirds of the volume under Food for Peace was wheat and wheat products, while feed grains and vegetable oils made up about 5 percent each. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, dairy products, pulses and other products made up the remainder. <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> accounted for nearly half the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allocations in 1987-88; <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, about a third, and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, about a fifth. <PERSON> Nightingale </PERSON> said the dollar amount of the 1988-89 allocations under Food for Peace has not been decided but that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has requested about $ 1.4 billion, which effectively would roll back the 5 percent increase of 1987-88. The 1988-89 money for Food for Peace is included in <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> appropriation bills currently being negotiated by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. <PERSON> Nightingale </PERSON> said that with few exceptions crop prospects in developing countries `` look good this season'' and that food supplies are up relative to current consumption. `` However, greater assistance is needed this year to rebuild stocks that were drawn down heavily last year,'' he said. Grains are the mainstay of food aid, with cereals making up 75 percent of the diet in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and 50 percent to 70 percent in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nightingale </ORGANIZATION> said. Although these regions produce a large share of the world's cereal crops, much that enters world trade is grown in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where drought has reduced supplies this year. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> monitors 55 countries for signs of food shortfall. Newly available information on the food-aid share of some countries' food imports `` indicates greater dependence on aid than previously thought,'' <PERSON> Nightingale </PERSON> said. Some countries have allocated less foreign exchange to food imports than thought earlier, he said. And because prices are up, the estimated amount of commercial imports will be only 6.5 million tons, compared with 11.7 million in 1987-88.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says three food stamp projects using plastic magnetic strip cards instead of paper coupons will be conducted in parts of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Assistant Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bode </PERSON> said Monday that nearly 30,000 food stamp households in the three states will use the cards to see if the system will be easier for people to use and to help reduce lost or stolen coupons. The projects are scheduled to begin within the next 8 to 12 months and run for at least three years, he said. An evaluation will be made to see if the electronic system might be used nationally. Bode said the $ 1.3 million project will operate by running the plastic cards through a computer terminal at grocery checkout counters. The cost of the food will be automatically deducted from the family's total monthly food stamp allotment. In addition, he said, some of the food stamp recipients will be able to use the same plastic cards for other public benefits, such as Aid for Families With Dependent Children. Bode said <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> will get $ 580,853 from <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to design its projects, which will be tested in <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, with services to 6,500 households. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> will receive $ 385,309 to test kits system in <LOCATION> Ramsey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> among 13,000 households, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will get $ 379 for its test in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> among 10,150 households. Nationally, nearly 19 million people are getting food stamp benefits, based on family size and adjusted household incomes. The program costs about $ 12.6 billion a year.

 <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>'s singing was ravishing and his co-stars were in sterling voice for the Metropolitan Opera's opening night performance of `` Il Trovatore'' Monday, but the production lacked excitement, at times resembling a concert more than an opera The staging of the <LOCATION> Fabrizio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Melano </LOCATION> production, which was new last November, works against excitement. The set is a high staircase extending across the stage. Most of the time, the singers take turns standing alone on the stairs. The stage is kept dark, with a changing backdrop of dark and white clouds. Of the three stars, <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Milnes </PERSON> took vocal honors in the first two acts, his voice strong and warm from the first note, while <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Marton </PERSON> held back for the last two acts. <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Manrico </PERSON>, was tender with the <LOCATION> Leonora </LOCATION>, sung by <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Marton </PERSON>, and with <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON>, sung by <PERSON> Fiorenza </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossotto </PERSON>. When there was reason for <ORGANIZATION> Manrico </ORGANIZATION> to be firm, <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>'s tones became stalwart. He also acted effectively, using spare but telling gestures. In 1976, <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> sang at the Met's opening night in this same opera. It was his first Met venture into heavier roles than the light, clear bel canto parts he had been singing. One heard strain in his voice as he repeatedly sang <PERSON> Manrico </PERSON> that season. Now, the role sounds natural and totally unstrained. Miss <PERSON> Marton </PERSON> was singing <PERSON> Leonora </PERSON> at the Met for the first time. Her voice is closer to being shrill than soft and sweet, but she has the volume, flexibility and stamina for the part. The last-act duet with <PERSON> Milnes </PERSON> was excitingly sung by both. And her `` D'amor sull ` ali rosee'' was Miss Cossotto, who made her Met debut 20 years ago, began with a hard vibrato but she dug into the part of <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> with artistry. <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, made his Met debut singing virtually the entire first scene. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, who has sung the captain of the guards in this opera with the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>, was self-possessed and sounded splendid. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> conducted. First lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> attended the opening, seated in one of the center boxes. Also in the audience were <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ambassador </LOCATION> and Mrs. <PERSON> Antony </PERSON> <PERSON> Acland </PERSON>, Italian Ambassador and Mrs. <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrignani </PERSON>, Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Renta </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Nureyev </PERSON>.

 `` Dead Ringers,'' a disturbing psychological thriller about twin gynecologists, opened in the No. 1 spot at the nation's box offices over the weekend while the rest of the field was dominated by summer holdovers. Directed by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronenberg </PERSON> and starring <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Irons </PERSON> in the dual role as brothers <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantle </PERSON>, `` Dead Ringers'' collected $ 3 million, according to figures released Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Exhibitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Two Disney films re-emerged among the box-office leaders, as `` Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' moved to fourth with receipts of $ 1.7 million and `` Cocktail'' advanced to fifth with revenues of $ 1.64 million The country's box office proceeds continued to be sluggish, with only three movies netting more than $ 2 million. Six films passed the $ 2 million mark last weekend, and even that was considered disappointing. `` Die Hard,'' the <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> action film, finished at No. 2 with $ 2.5 million worth of tickets sold. Former box-office champion `` A Fish Called <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>,'' a comedy featuring <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleese </PERSON>, fell to No. 3, with $ 2.2 million. `` A Nightmare on Elm Street 4'' came in sixth with $ 1.62 million, followed by `` Young Guns'' in seventh with $ 1.5 million. Rounding out the top 10 were `` Moon Over Parador'' in eighth with $ 1.5 million, `` Betrayed'' in ninth with $ 1.4 million and the new film `` <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>,'' starring <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, in tenth with $ 1.3 million. Two heavily promoted new movies _ `` Gorillas in the Mist'' and `` <ORGANIZATION> Patty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION>'' _ generated dramatically different business. Playing on just 15 screens, `` Gorillas'' drew $ 367,000, or $ 24,462 per screen. `` <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>,'' on the other hand, averaged only $ 1,300 per screen at 460 theaters nationwide. Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in release. 1. `` Dead Ringers,'' 20th <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION>, $ 3 million, 1,042 screens, $ 2,891 per screen, $ 3 million, one week. 2. `` Die Hard,'' 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, $ 2.5 million, 1,282 screens, $ 1,909 per screen, $ 68.2 million, 11 weeks. 3. `` A Fish Called Wanda,'' <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>, $ 2.2 million, 1,164 screens, $ 1,895 per screen, $ 48.3 million, 11 weeks. 4. `` Who Framed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>,'' Disney, $ 1.7 million, 1,321 screens, $ 1,280 per screen, $ 138.2 million, 14 weeks. 5. `` Cocktail,'' <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.64 million, 1,276 screens, $ 1,287 per screen, $ 65.4 million, nine weeks. 6. `` A Nightmare on Elm Street 4,'' New Line, $ 1.62 million, 1,207 screens, $ 1,339 per screen, $ 43.6 million, six weeks. 7. `` Young Guns,'' 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, $ 1.5 million, 1,295 screens, $ 1,168 per screen, $ 36.9 million, seven weeks. 8. `` Moon Over Parador,'' Universal, $ 1.5 million, 1,058 screens, $ 1,390 per screen, $ 8.8 million, three weeks. 9. `` Betrayed,'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.4 million, 1,066 screens, $ 1,305 per screen, $ 21.7 million, five weeks. 10. `` <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.3 million, 847 screens, $ 1,505 per screen, $ 1.3 million, one week.

<HEAD>Reagan Expected To Sign Bill On Endangered Species Protection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is expected to sign legislation to boost spending on protection of endangered species, with a special focus on efforts to pressure ivory-producing African nations to crack down on elephant poaching. `` We have no major objections to the bill,'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> completed congressional action on a renewal of the Endangered Species Act. The 15-year-old law, a world model for preserving plants, animals and fish from extinction, prohibits trade in endangered or threatened species and requires the government to take affirmative steps to save them and avoid actions that would hurt them. In separate action Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sent the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> a bill to reauthorize the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act and initiate a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program to curb the mounting losses of dolphins to yellowfin tuna fishermen in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The passage of the Endangered Species Act renewal capped four years of struggle by congressional environmentalists to strengthen the basic law and raise the amount that can be spent on the protection program. The legislation, worked out by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators, would authorize, subject to the appropriations process, the spending of $ 56 million next year, rising to $ 66 million in 1992. The current level is about $ 39 million. The bill contains a new program that would provide money to states that enter into cooperative agreements to assist in preserving endangered or threatened species. States could share $ 15 million next year, going up to $ 18 million in 1992. The legislation also would authorize <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spending of $ 25 million through 1993 in an effort to halt population declines among African elephants, whose numbers reportedly have dropped to 700,000 from 1.5 million in 1979. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would be required to review elephant-conservation programs of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s ivory-producing nations and bar imports of ivory from countries whose programs are deemed ineffective to halt elephant poaching. The bill would bar raw ivory imports from any nation without a native elephant population and would require <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ivory importers and exporters to obtain licenses from the department. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohlen </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action should `` put teeth'' into international efforts to halt the illegal hunting of elephants. `` It's not going to happen overnight, but it's a good step forward,'' he said in a telephone interview. A violation of the elephant protection provisions could bring a maximum civil penalty of $ 5,000 and a top criminal penalty of a $ 200,000 fine and a year in prison. Maximum fines for violating the basic Endangered Species Act would also be boosted, from $ 20,000 to $ 50,000. There currently are nearly 1,000 species on the endangered-threatened list, about 400 of them native to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The bill would require the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to step up efforts to monitor the condition of species proposed for addition to the list. Environmentalists say about 80 species have become extinct while awaiting formal protection. The way for passage of the legislation was cleared after a compromise was reached over a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration plan to require shrimp harvesters to use excluder devices to prevent sea turtles from drowning in their nets. The bill would delay mandatory use of the devices in offshore waters until May 1, 1989 and in inshore waters until a year later. In the interim, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> would study the viability of sea turtle populations. Under the marine mammal bill, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would be able to ban tuna imports from nations that fail to take steps to reduce the drowning deaths of dolphins in tuna nets to rates comparable to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> tuna fleet. Dolphins are at risk because schools of yellowfin tuna are frequently found swimming beneath dolphins in the eastern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Congressional committees have been told that 115,000 dolphins died in foreign nets last year, compared to less than 14,000 in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nets. The bill also would require a study of the effects on dolphins of so-called seal bombs used by commercial yellowfin tuna boats and a study of the high death rates of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> bottlenosed dolphin off the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> in 1987 and 1988.

A last-minute settlement in the feud over the $ 350 million trust left by <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION> broke down in court Monday. Mrs. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> had complained that <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, an ally of <ORGANIZATION> Edsel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, was demanding a $ 1 million-a-year salary to administer the trust, and that he had threatened to cut her income to the minimum level of $ 1.5 million.

<HEAD>Judges Suggest Eastern Layoff Decision Was Not Anti-Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' decision to lay off 4,000 workers apparently was a normal business move, not an anti-union tactic, two federal appeals judges have suggested. At a hearing Monday on a lower court's ruling that the layoffs are illegal, Circuit Judges <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> challenged arguments by union lawyers that the airline was trying to weaken organized labor at the bargaining table. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Linsey </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the layoffs were inconsistent with past Eastern practices. He said they also violated Railway Labor Act requirements to preserve the status quo during labor negotiations. `` There certainly is past practice to cut unprofitable routes,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` There is no history of dramatic downsizing,'' <PERSON> Linsey </PERSON> said, referring to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s closing of its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hub and the elimination of service to 14 cities. But <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said figures showed that Eastern had made other large cuts in its work force since 1980. Last month, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> ruled that the layoffs were subject to negotiation with its unions under the Railway Labor Act. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> granted the injunction sought by the pilots union, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> could proceed with its plan to stop service in 14 cities and close its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hub. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here allowed <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to proceed with the layoffs, as well, after the airline posted a $ 4.7 million bond to cover a month's worth of wages for the furloughed workers. During Monday's hearing, <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> challenged <PERSON> Linsey </PERSON>'s argument that the decision by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, not to invest any money in the financially troubled airline was motivated by a desire to eventually close the carrier because its work force was unionized. That decision `` also fits with certain financial realities,'' <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> also suggested that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to invest money in <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s non-union sister carrier, resulted from `` a business judgment that a dollar invested in <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> will go further.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have held preliminary talks on ways to limit the spread of ballistic missiles to Third World countries, according to an administration official. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had made it known earlier this month that they hoped such a meeting could be arranged with Soviet officials while they visited <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for broader arms control discussions.

<TEXT>
 The 197th edition of the Old Farmer's Almanac contains a forecast for a white Christmas in the East, a prediction of woe for <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> fans, and former Sen. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON>'s technique for mesmerizing Published in tiny <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, the oldest continuously published almanac in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hits newsstands today with its usual, homey brand of `` new, useful and entertaining matter'' for the 9 million readers it claims. A competing Farmer's Almanac, which is marking its 55th year, was released earlier this month. That publication is sold to banks, insurance companies and other businesses for distribution to customers as a promotion and claims a circulation of more than 5 million. Started in 1792, the 224-page Old Farmer's Almanac also contains its usual fearless extended weather forecast for 1989 for 16 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regions. Editor <PERSON> Judson </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> claims 80 percent accuracy with the secret formula and the `` most modern scientific calculation based on solar activity,'' although it failed to predict last summer's devastating drought. Looking ahead, the almanac predicts heavy snow starting around Thanksgiving from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and down the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, with a frigid December in some sections before temperatures rise and the weather dries. That means a white Christmas, but `` snow stopping in time for cork popping'' at New Year's. While <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the desert <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> should prepare for below-normal temperatures, the rest of the country will get a warmer winter than usual. For the summer, the almanac calls for cooler, wetter weather along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, normal temperatures in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the Deep South, and drier weather in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. But for the often-disappointed fans of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s beloved <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION>, next September's forecast is the most crucial: It comes with the warning, `` Sox in first, expect the worst.'' The familiar black and yellow publication, punctuated this year with sporty red highlights, again offers predictions for consumers, who can expect fake caviar, low-calorie tortilla chips, scented newspaper ads and the `` ultimate indignity'' _ garbage rationing _ in the coming 15 months. The casual reader may also be drawn to educational features, such as the `` straight facts about warts'' and ways to get rid of them ranging from `` bizarre and complicated'' to `` extremely disgusting'' and `` downright criminal.'' <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of state, offered a followup to a 1984 article on hypnotizing chickens with his own `` foolproof ways to hypnotize a lobster.'' By stroking the tail in a downward motion, `` curling it as you go,'' he said, you can impress friends by getting the lobster to do a claw stand on its head. A vigorous shake should bring the lobster back to its senses, but if that does n't work, <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON> wrote, just whisper in its ear, `` Drawn butter, drawn butter.''

<HEAD>Engineer Who Tried To Stop Challenger Launch Still Rebuilding Life</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's taken <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> 32 months to recover from Challenger and get ready to try again. It may take <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> even longer. <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>, then one of the chief engineers for rocket manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, warned his bosses on Jan. 27, 1986, that a flawed rocket booster design could fail if Challenger was launched from the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in freezing temperatures. His concerns were ridiculed by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials, then rejected by <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> managers. The space shuttle blew up the next day, exactly as <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> feared. He believes that despite a costly redesign and testing effort, the rocket engines still have potentially disastrous weak spots. `` To me, it's just another disaster waiting to happen,'' said the 50-year-old engineer. Discovery is scheduled to lift off Thursday on the first manned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space mission since Challenger. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which has reviewed the booster redesign and testing, say the new rocket engine is not perfect, but is much safer than the one that failed with Challenger. Challenger was destroyed when pressurized flame leaked from a joint between segments in one of the shuttles's pair of solid-fuel rocket boosters, touching off an explosion that killed all seven astronauts. In testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> which investigated the accident, <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> revealed that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> knew the rocket engines had leaked on past launches and were working toward a solution even while continuing shuttle flights. Afterward, <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> said, he was shunned by fellow workers and neighbors, and <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> put him on the sidelines while work started on a redesign of the rocket joint. `` When I realized what was happening, it absolutely destroyed me,'' <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> said in a recent telephone interview. `` It destroyed my career, my life, everything else. I'm just now getting back to the point where I think I'll be able to work as an engineer again.'' A doctor said <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> was suffering from traumatic stress syndrome, and the engineer took medical leave from <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>. Later, <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> named the company in a series of lawsuits that sought recovery of $ 2.07 billion for himself and the federal government. The last of the suits was dismissed earlier this month by a judge. In the past year, <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> has toured the country, speaking before engineering groups and attacking what he believes is a `` business as usual'' attitude in <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and at <LOCATION> Morton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thiokol </LOCATION>. His theme is simple: Engineers have the obligation to report shoddy work or design when they find it because people's safety is at stake. But, says <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>, the life of a whistleblower is often unpleasant and could be personally disastrous. `` They -LRB- whistleblowers -RRB- should know that if they do speak out against their organization they will pay some sort of a price,'' he said. <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> has received major awards from the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> for his efforts to stop the Challenger launch and to make changes in the shuttle rocket design. `` The very fact that some people are interested in what I stand for has been very encouraging,'' he said. But <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> said he is still looking for work, and added sadly, `` It's not the easiest thing to do to get a new job at 50 years old even under normal conditions.'' His home near the Morton Thiokol plant in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> is up for sale. <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> and his wife hope to move to <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. Wherever he goes, said <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>, he's going to avoid watching shuttle launches on television. `` I just do n't want to go through that hell again,'' he said.

 The army claims 26 opposition activists arrested last week were involved in a plan devised by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agents to overthrow Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and send him into exile. Col. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, head of the army's G-2 intelligence unit, presented a document to reporters Monday that he said security agents discovered during the arrests. He claimed the six-page document, entitled `` Mission: To Force the Departure of General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'', was authored by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and proved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in efforts to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, dismissed the allegation as `` absurd'' and said it was designed `` to divert attention from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political problems.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> adminstration has imposed economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in a bid to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign as commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the country's de facto ruler. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last February on charges of trafficking in Colombian cocaine. Pro-government newspapers originally said 18 people were arrested on Thursday and Friday for alleged involvement in clandestine activities. But the army said Monday that 26 people were detained. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> told reporters the document was `` the work of the intelligence services of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' and could be found `` inside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> psychological operations manuals.'' He did not elaborate. Copies of the document were made available to reporters. It appeared to be a telefax and was written in Spanish. Proposals outlined in the document included making contact with potential dissidents within the army and disseminating anti-Noriega propaganda, maintaining contact with the foreign press and lobbying democratic governments in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The document bore no identifying stamps, seals or signatures. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> told reporters several weapons were discovered during the arrests of the activists, but refused to provide details. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Nivaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrinan </PERSON>, director of the army's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said several of those detained had confessed to working with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials and two former <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military officers in a bid to undermine the government. He said the two officers, identified as Lt. Col. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> and Maj. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalaz </PERSON>, operated out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Some of those arrested illegally left <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on flights from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in the former Canal Zone to meet with <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> and <PERSON> Villalaz </PERSON> and plan strategy, <PERSON> Madrinan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Madrinan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> alleged the 26 detainees belonged to two anti-government groups they identified as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conformity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and the March 16th Active Movement. Three detainees present at the news conference told reporters they were involved in subversive activity against the government. One of them, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Serracin </PERSON>, is director of the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the capital. Reporters were barred from asking him questions. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> said authorities were continuing their investigation and that more arrests could be expected. Members of the Authentic Panamanian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> parties last week rejected charges that those arrested were involved in clandestine activities against the government. `` This is a method that the regime has used on various occasions before against those of us who represent the democratic aspirations of the people,'' <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters Friday.

<HEAD>U.S. Team Leaves For Crash Site Surveys In Laos</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team seeking to account for missing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen flew to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> today to survey sites where American planes crashed during the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war, an official said. The team, which departed from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, is to survey an area around <LOCATION> Sepone </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> to prepare for possible later excavations of the crash sites, said Maj. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. The team is from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, both Honolulu-based units seeking to account for 2,393 Americans missing in action from the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said the team included a Marine with special expertise in plane crashes. `` They will look at crash sites and determine what kind of aircraft -LRB- crashed -RRB-, how it crashed, and determine the potential for possible future site excavations,'' <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> told reporters. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> losses in that area near the Vietnamese border include airmen downed in missions to cut off the Ho Chi Minh Trail, used by communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to infiltrate troops to U.S.-backed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The war ended with communist victories in all three Indochinese countries in 1975. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> have conducted three previous joint crash site excavations, most recently in May. In <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, meanwhile, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team was working with <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> officials on the second day of an unprecedented investigation to determine the fates of seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airmen lost in plane crashes near the capital, <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team, which brought its own interpreters, is interviewing villagers who witnessed incidents in which the men were lost and is seeking evidence such as local government reports and human remains. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said the seven are among 70 `` discrepancy cases'' _ those in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says there is strong evidence the men survived and were taken under Vietnamese control. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says it can not prove any Americans are alive in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>, but can not ignore that possibility. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> is currently investigating 119 reports of purported sightings of Americans, <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said. The Americans drove to the Vietnamese villages Monday in jeeps they had flown in from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> the day before. The search is scheduled to last about 10 days. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said the two sides may later excavate plane crash sites found during the investigation. Previously, the only significant joint field activity was in late 1985, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers and Vietnamese state workers dug up the wreckage of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> B-52 bomber just outside <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. They found remains but none were identified as missing Americans. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, leader of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, earlier expressed hope for several joint investigation operations in the coming months. `` We are prepared to provide four teams, if <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> agrees,'' he said. Of the 2,393 Americans missing, 1,757 are in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, 547 in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, 83 in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and six in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces withdrew from <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> in 1973 after the conflict cost 58,000 American lives.

<HEAD>Rains Hampers Rescue Efforts In Flood-Affected States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More rain fell today in flooded parts of the northern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, hampering operations to rescue at least 200,000 people marooned by rising waters, an official said. Fifty air force helicopters were deployed to lift people to safer areas, but the operations were disrupted by rains, said J.F. <PERSON> Ribeiro </PERSON>, adviser to the state governor. <PERSON> Ribeiro </PERSON> said at least 138 people have died in the flooding, mainly from drownings, in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since it began Wednesday. He said the inundation had claimed at least 200 lives in the neighboring states of <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Himachal </PERSON> <PERSON> Pradesh </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, the most populated of the four states, has borne the brunt of the floods. The state's road and rail links with the rest of the country were cut off, though airports were still functioning. The three major rivers in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Ravi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Beas </PERSON> and Sutlej were all flowing above danger levels, <PERSON> Ribeiro </PERSON> said. He said six of the state's nine administrative districts had been affected. More than 1,500 villages in the six districts were inundated and waters have entered low-lying areas of <LOCATION> Ludhiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kapurthala </LOCATION> cities, he said. The floods were caused by heavy rains in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> as the annual southwest monsoon draws to a close. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, authorities ordered the closure of a bridge over the adjacent <LOCATION> Jamuna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which is also flowing above the danger mark. A government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told reporters Monday that Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> had appointed a crisis management group to tackle the emergency. Floods triggered by the summer monsoon are a frequent problem in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. In late August, monsoon-swollen rivers innundated three-fourths of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> in the worst floods in the country's histry. The government said at least 1,000 people died but newspapers put the toll at more than 2,000.

<TEXT>
 The weather in the <ORGANIZATION> Sunshine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> could be the critical factor as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s manned space program looks to new life Thursday with the launching of shuttle Discovery. `` The potential is there'' for frequent delays because of tough new weather constraints imposed after the Challenger disaster 2 -LCB- years ago, says Launch Director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON>. Never mind hurricanes. A stray cloud, a stiff wind or a shower could ground the shuttle as surely as a mechanical breakdown. `` Based on historical statistics, there's a 60 percent chance we will go'' on schedule, mission commander <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> said upon arrival at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> on Monday on a rain-and-lightning-delayed flight from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` The bird is ready and we're ready,'' said <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>. But, he added, `` We're going to keep our fingers crossed on the weather.'' The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> peninsula is subject to fast-changing, sometimes-unpredictable storms during the summer-autumn changeover, particularly around this seaside spaceport. Thursday's forecast called for scattered and broken clouds, widely scattered showers, a temperature of 85 degrees and southeasterly winds of 10-15 knots. The new restrictions that would ban liftoff include: _ Moderate rain or other precipitation in either takeoff or landing areas. _ Lightning within 10 miles of the launch pad 30 minutes before liftoff. _ A temperature below 37 or above 99 degrees Fahrenheit. _ Surface winds 24 knots, or 17 knots from the South. Launch managers say stray clouds that drift near the pad from as far away as the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, 150 miles away on the other side of the peninsula, would keep the shuttle grounded. There can be no lightning-producing clouds within 10 nautical miles of the launch site. Cold weather was found to be a key factor in the Challenger disaster, preventing a seal on a right booster rocket joint from doing its job of stopping the escape of gases which ignited the orbiter's main fuel tank. Responsibility for safe launch conditions is in the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> detachment at nearby <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> Air Force Station. It is in constant touch with meteorologists at weather facilities all along Discovery's planned flight path. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> weather watchers rely on sounding rockets that gather information in the atmosphere 250,000 feet up, weather balloons carrying instrument packages, wind towers, lightning sensors as far west as the <LOCATION> Walt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Disney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> area about 50 miles away, radar antennas that scan the ocean and satellite data. But man is critical to the system, particularly because of the volatile conditions in the area, said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madura </PERSON>, staff meteorologist for the Eastern Space and Missile Center. <LOCATION> Madura </LOCATION> has final responsibility for giving a go-for-launch signal, or aborting the liftoff, because of weather conditions. `` No constraints go from red to green unless I say so,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> fixed the family vacuum cleaner when he was 3. Now, at 14, he's investigating ways to fight cancer. A number of scientific authorities believe he is on the right track. <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>, braces and all, might raise some eyebrows when he presents his paper on colon cancer at a clinical research conference next month. But his co-researcher and next-door neighbor, cancer specialist Dr. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisman </PERSON>, said that even if the adolescent's voice cracks a little, few will doubt his competence by the end of his presentation. `` Working with him was like working with a -LRB- post-doctoral -RRB- fellow,'' <PERSON> Tisman </PERSON> said. `` His abilities are remarkable and he was full of knowledge about chemistry even though he has n't ever taken a chemistry course in school.'' <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>, a high school freshman and computer whiz, spent more than 1,300 hours researching the project, <PERSON> Tisman </PERSON> said. `` But he's still a kid, basically,'' <PERSON> Tisman </PERSON> added. `` My lab technician used to complain that <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> would leave his candy wrappers laying around.'' And like a kid, <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> is concerned about having to miss two days of school. `` But my teachers believe this is a legitimate reason to be gone,'' he said. `` And besides, this should help me get into college.'' <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> will travel with Tisman to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to present their research Oct. 7 at an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> conference. Rules dictate that if two authors submit a paper and one of them is older than 41, the younger author is the presenter. Tisman is 46. `` His being so young will surprise some people,'' <PERSON> Tisman </PERSON> said. `` But I have confidence in him.'' <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>'s father said his son's accomplishments do n't surprise him. `` When <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was 3 years old, the vacuum cleaner broke, and by <PERSON> God </PERSON>, he fixed it,'' said the retired civil engineer. The method Tisman and <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> developed will need further testing, but <PERSON> Tisman </PERSON> said it has been effective at his private clinic in <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION>. The new therapy is a twist on existing treatment of colon cancer, <PERSON> Tisman </PERSON> said. It combines two drugs, 5-Fluorodeoxyuridine, or 5-FUdR, and Leucovorin, which kill cancer cells by inhibiting replication of DNA, an essential element in all living matter, <PERSON> Tisman </PERSON> said. A similar drug, 5-Fluorouracil, or 5-FU, has been used with Leucovorin to treat certain types of cancer since researchers discovered a few years ago that Leucovorin increased 5-FU's effectiveness But Tisman and <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> said their research suggests 5-FUdR may be more effective than 5-FU when used with Leucovorin. Dr. <PERSON> Youcef </PERSON> <PERSON> Rustum </PERSON>, a noted cancer researcher and deputy director of the Grace Cancer Drug Center at <ORGANIZATION> Roswell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, called the research an `` important concept in cancer chemotherapy.'' <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>, an only child, said most of his free time is spent with his computer. When he was 11, he attended a computer camp at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> aimed at high school seniors. He has $ 23,000 worth of computer gear, centering on a Macintosh II, the fifth computer his father has bought him since he was 9. `` He just keeps outgrowing them, I guess,'' his father said.

 <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, known to millions as the wisecracking brother of the nation's 39th president, was eulogized as a couragous man who was prepared to devote his life helping others overcome alcoholism. `` <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was struck down in the prime of his life,'' country singer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said in the eulogy at a graveside ceremony Monday. `` He was just beginning a new chapter. He was planning his travels to help others take charge of their lives.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, 51, died Sunday of pancreatic cancer, the disease that killed his father and an older sister. About 500 mourners gathered at the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> to pay their last respects to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who was thrust into the national spotlight after his older brother, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>, became president in 1977. The younger <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> became well known for his down-home and often irreverent witticisms and his beer-drinking at a service station he once owned in Plains. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Sybil </PERSON>, and the couple's six children were seated in front of <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s cherry casket, which was covered by a blanket of exotic flowers and surrounded by dozens of wreaths. In the crowd were <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON>, who lived next door to <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. The former president said his relationship with his brother, strained during his years in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, improved in later years. `` We worked together for many years, side by side. While I was president, we went in opposite directions, but in the last year, we've just been friends,'' he said. `` My mother said, ` Never underestimate him,''' the former president said. `` He was the most intelligent one in the family.'' In delivering the eulogy, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had overcome many of his own personal problems and was planning to work with others overcoming alcoholism. In 1979, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> spent seven weeks in an alcohol rehabilitation program. `` He died with courage, not to say he went gently into that dark night,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. In the year since his cancer was diagnosed, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had tried a variety of experimental treatments. He lived longer than his doctors expected. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was buried a short distance from the graves of his mother `` Miss <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, and his father, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. The service was conducted by the Rev. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ariail </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Maranatha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> teaches Sunday school.

<TEXT>
 Israeli warplanes dive-bombed Shiite Moslem guerrilla bases in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> today in the 15th Israeli raid into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year, police said. At least two Israeli jet fighters took part in the air attack on bases belonging to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, the police said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is made up of <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> zealots backed by the Islamic revolution of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. The attack lasted 10 minutes, during which the planes bombed the militants' positions in pine woods near the Christian-inhabited town of <LOCATION> Jezzine </LOCATION> the police spokesman said. Smoke billowed from the stricken bases after the attacks, which began at 11:30 a.m., he said. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, an army spokesman said the targets had served as headquarters for planning and executing attacks against Israeli forces and Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said the pilots made accurate hits on their targets and returned safely. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, police said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gunners returned fire at the planes with anti-aircraft weapons but missed their targets. The Israeli army communique said the planes struck at a site near the village of <LOCATION> Al-Luwayzah </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of the Christian town of <LOCATION> Marjayoun </LOCATION>, where Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen are based. On Friday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes attacked <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla bases near the southern <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, apparently in retaliation for a Sept. 16 infiltration attempt. Police said three guerrillas were killed and five were missing and presumed killed after the attack. Sixty-five people were killed and 108 wounded in the previous Israeli raids this year. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdrew the bulk of its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in June 1985 after a three-year occupation but maintains a six-to-10-mile wide buffer zone north of the Israeli border. The area is patrolled by about 1,000 Israeli troops and 1,500 militiamen of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Jezzine </LOCATION> is the northernmost position manned by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia.

<TEXT>
 A Mexican drug trafficker tied to a murder by a strand of hair became the second of three defendants to be convicted in the 1985 torture killing of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Urquidez </PERSON>, portrayed by prosecutors as the chief lieutenant of reputed Mexican drug lord <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, was found guilty Monday by a jury that deliberated four days. The panel was to return today to deliberate further on the third defendant's guilt or innocence. The remaining defendant, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, the 38-year-old former owner of a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> seafood company, is charged with aiding and abetting <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> in his escape to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> after the killing of <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and his pilot, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>, 36, was convicted of five counts of conspiracy, kidnapping, murder and two counts of violent acts in support of racketeering. The latter charge is a new statute aimed at drug-related crimes. The battered bodies of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and his pilot were found buried at a remote ranch outside <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> in March 1985, nearly a month after <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> was kidnapped outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in the Mexican city. The only physical evidence against <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> was a single strand of hair found at <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> compound, where <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> is believed to have been killed. Circumstantial evidence came from government informants, including other drug smugglers who said they heard <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> discuss the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> killing. One witness who made a plea bargain with the government told of seeing <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> at the villa the day of the murder. He said <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> spoke with another man about `` a problem'' they had just solved. <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> could be sentenced to life in prison. Sentencing was set for Oct. 26. The federal jury convicted former Mexican policeman <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> in the murders on Thursday. <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>, an admitted drug trafficker, and his attorneys sighed when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON> read the first guilty verdict. Defense attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pancer </PERSON> portrayed <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> as a pawn in a political game played by the Mexican and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governments. He said <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> was sacrificed to close an embarassing case that had strained relations between the two countries. `` <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> is innocent,'' <PERSON> Pancer </PERSON> told reporters. `` They flat-out fooled this jury.'' Prosecutors witheld comment until after jurors return the last verdict. Prosecutors contend <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> ordered the killings as retribution for <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s role in raids on <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>'s marijuana plantations. They said that <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> helped in the executions. Evidence showed the agent and pilot were tortured with red-hot metal pipes and beaten so severely that <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s skull was crushed. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 28, was a member of a Mexican state police homicide squad in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> at the time. His sentencing was set for Oct. 24. <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>, 37, and an associate, <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON>, were convicted in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> last week on narcotics and weapons charges. <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> was sentenced to 34 years and <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> to 11 years. Nine men were indicted in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> but only three were tried here. One defendant subsequently died. Four, including <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON>, were tried in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on narcotics and murder charges. Verdicts have not yet been reached on some of those charges, including the murder charges.

<HEAD>CDC Unveils New `Hot Lab' For Studying World's Deadliest Viruses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> researchers soon will move into their new `` hot lab,'' a $ 20 million super-sealed laboratory with a 21st century feel, to study the world's deadliest viruses. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> officials unveiled it Monday, showing off the secret-code passageways, air locks, decontamination equipment, containment cabinets and space suits that will be off-limits to all outsiders once deadly pathogens are brought in starting next month. The complex will be formally dedicated Oct. 28. For years, the center has studied what scientists call Level 4 pathogens: mircroorganisms or viruses with the most dangerous classification according to deadliness, availability of vaccine or treatment and risk of transmission in the laboratory. Such agents include Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever and <LOCATION> Rift </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> fever, diseases rarely, if ever, seen in this country and much more hazardous in the lab than AIDS or rabies, said Dr. <PERSON> Olen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kew </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Molecular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> at the center. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s first facility for the study of such pathogens, built in 1967, was in a large trailer. Two larger labs followed. The new facility, officially known as the Viral and Rickettsial Diseases Laboratory but called `` the hot lab'' by those who work there, will give <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researchers more space and more modern technology than they've ever had before, said Dr. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON>, a microbiologist with the Office of Biosafety. `` After 10 years, the old Level 4 lab was beginning to show its age,'' <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> said. `` This will very much contribute to our overall mission of controlling infectious disease ... around the world,'' said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s Center for Infectious Diseases. The laboratory building, located at the federal health agency's compound near <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, spans more than 95,000 square feet and is actually two buildings in one _ a six-story facility containing 12 separate labs, and a three-story Level 4 facility with two separate state-of-the-art containment labs, connected by a central atrium The new labs also have intricate waste disposal facilities, to inactivate, then remove, any hazardous substances. Walls in the new Level 4 facility are poured concrete, 9 inches thick. Inside, the labs themselves, researchers will wear blue plastic space suits, connected to a safe air supply by red hoses which dangle from various points above them. To enter their lab, they will pass through a series of increasingly secure checkpoints _ from the card-key system which opens the outer corridor doors, to a secret-code control which opens inner doors, to heavy, submarine-style steel gasket doors opening into a special chemical shower and air lock. That, in turn, opens onto the lab. Getting in takes about five minutes; getting out takes about 20, as workers shower first in their space suits _ with a special disinfectant fluid _ then take showers themselves. `` We go out to lunch sometimes, but you do n't drink a lot of coffee in the morning,'' joked research microbiologist <PERSON> Luanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>. `` It takes too long to get in and out.''

<HEAD>Judge Approves Settlement for Owners of Kodak Instant Cameras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some 3.4 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> owners of <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s discontinued instant cameras should get up to $ 70 in cash and coupons just in time for Christmas under a new settlement. `` I think both sides agree it's an excellent settlement,'' said <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, one of four attorneys who filed the class-action lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, saying he was `` very, very pleased'' after Monday's decision. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, which was forced to stop making instant cameras and film after a patent dispute, said the settlement is worth $ 150 million, but attorneys for camera owners pegged it at more than $ 200 million. The settlement approved by <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> applies to 39 <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> instant camera models, ranging from the Fiesta, the lowest-priced model, to the Kodamatic 980L, the most expensive. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said the cash and coupons would probably be mailed in late November, in time for Christmas shopping. Depending on the cost of their instant camera, owners will receive amounts ranging from $ 52 in cash and $ 18 in coupons to $ 19.50 in cash and $ 30.50 in coupons. The coupons, accompanied by proof of purchase, then can be sent to the company for a rebate. The coupons could also be used in purchasing Kodak products such as film, cameras or batteries. `` From <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s point of view, it's good and fair,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney representing the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, company. The lawsuit was filed against the company in January 1986, asking that it compensate owners for instant cameras that were virtually useless after a ruling against <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> in its legal battle with <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> infringed on <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s instant-camera patent when it entered the market in Instant photography was invented by Dr. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Land </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, and was first marketed in 1948. It enables users to view a photographic print shortly after taking a picture. Polaroid retained a monopoly in the instant photography field until 1976, when <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> entered the market with a competing system. Polaroid immediately filed a lawsuit, charging patent infringement. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> sided with <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> let stand lower court rulings when it refused to hear <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal in October 1986.

Paid union scale of $ 97 each, they performed Monday in an episode in which welfare hotel residents chase a drug dealer from their neighborhood. <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 12, who lives with his family in an apartment now, had made such an impression on <PERSON> Kristen </PERSON> that he was given a primary role with several speaking lines. `` No, I'm confident, babe,'' he told her when asked if he wanted to rehearse. The episode is to air Oct. 6.

<TEXT>
 Uncounted numbers of teen-agers and children who this year filed their first tax returns are about to get a message from the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>: Pay your overdue taxes or your bank account may be seized. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, weary at being equated with the <ORGANIZATION> Grinch </ORGANIZATION> that stole Christmas, is going out of its way to avoid carrying out that threat. Almost six months after the April 15 deadline for filing 1987 returns, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is completing a series of mailings to more than 15 million taxpayers of all ages who filed but failed to pay all or part of their taxes. Because as many as 8 million young people were brought onto the tax rolls in 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> believes the number of taxpayers who did n't pay up includes many first-time filers. And the agency is trying to impress on them the importance of paying up. `` We assume these younger taxpayers are not too sophisticated about the tax laws and we are trying to make them aware of their obligations,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> said Monday. The young people at risk could be a 1 - or 2-year-olds with interest or dividends on investments given to them, or a 19-year-old college student with a part-time job Each could have become liable for taxes in 1987 because of the big tax overhaul enacted a year earlier. `` With several million new filers as a result of this new law, there's no question but that there are some folks who filed returns without paying,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, deputy assistant <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> commissioner for collections. `` The notices -LRB- of taxes due -RRB- are out there and we're hoping they will contact us and try to resolve this without having to resort to any type of collection action.'' Any taxpayer who files a return on time but fails to pay the taxes due is likely to receive one or more comnputer-generated notices from the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. There usually is a series of four letters, three or four weeks apart, each sounding a little tougher than the last. The fourth letter cautions that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> will take legal action to collect the tax unless it is paid within 10 days. That action, <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> notes, can include seizing the bank account of a child with interest income or the wages of one who is on a payroll. Past-due bills are subject to 10 percent interest plus a penalty that climbs to 1 percent a month after the fourth notice is sent. Under the 1986 law, any child must file a return if he or she has any combination of earnings and unearned income _ including interest and dividends _ over $ 500. The unexpected tax bite on many young people comes from another change: Any child who can be claimed as a dependent by a parent is denied a personal exemption on his or her own return.

<TEXT>
 The tax evasion trial of real estate magnate <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and his hotel queen wife, <PERSON> Leona </PERSON>, has been delayed until early next year because of a legal appeal. The decision by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> on Monday was unrelated to a defense lawyer's claim that the 79-year-old <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> suffers from `` acute memory difficulties.'' In a affidavit filed late last week, <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wing </PERSON> wrote the judge that his client's memory problems `` render him unable to assist adequately in his own defense.'' After examinations by five neurologists and neuro-psychologists, all but one of `` concluded that Mr. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> has a significant memory disability,'' Wing said. Wing, who sought an indefinite delay of the businessman's trial, said, `` forcing him to stand trial in his present condition would effectively deprive him of his constitutional rights.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who has postponed the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>' trial twice before, delayed the case until Jan. 16 because of a legal appeal by Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and a court scheduling conflict. The Helmsleys were indicted in April on state and federal charges that they allegedly disguised about $ 4 million in renovations to their <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, mansion as business expenses and took bogus tax deductions. The Helmsleys and two former aides have pleaded innocent to the 188-count state indictment and the 47-count federal indictment. State prosecutors have agreed to let the federal case go first. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 67, is appealing <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s denial of her bid to dismiss the federal indictment. She said she was granted immunity from prosecution for her grand jury testimony in an earlier state sales tax investigation. Prosecutors say court papers on the appeal could not be filed until Oct. 14. Also, one of the defense attorneys begins a previously scheduled trial on Nov. 21 before another judge. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said an unidentified doctor `` interviewed and examined'' <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> over the weekend and `` expressed some views to me'' over the telephone. The judge said he would not rule on the defense motion to sever <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> from the case until he sees the doctor's written report

 Parliament today named <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, a longtime foe of the Solidarity trade union, as the country's ninth prime minister since World War II. The choice of party propaganda chief <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> comes less than a month before planned talks between the government and Solidarity on reinstating the labor federation's legal status and reviving <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s crippled economy. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, a journalist who represented communist authorities in 1980-81 talks with Solidarity, became prime minister by a 338-5 vote, with 35 abstentions, in a nationally televised parliament vote. The new prime minister immediately asked for two weeks to form a new government composed of people with `` reformist attitudes'' and said he would seek to broaden the communist-dominated governing coalition. `` I want to create a Cabinet which will have a broader social confidence. We are being told, ` Move over. Let others participate in actual co-rule,''' he said. Before the vote, Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, that the new government would be open to dialogue and economic reform. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, 61, had been proposed for the job by <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and on Monday received the backing of the 230-member <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The party controls the government through its majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>. In a nominating speech that lasted nearly 30 minutes, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was in a promising period despite its economic difficulties and political divisions. He referred to upcoming talks with the opposition and other representatives of Polish society. `` To build the future together we all have to change ... Let us abandon narrow-mindedness,'' the Polish leader said. He said there would be no `` forbidden topics'' in the talks, but said they must have a `` rational framework'' that respects the constitutional order, a phrase used to refer to the dominant role of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said the new government would be `` bold and effective'' in dealing with the economy by introducing reforms while protecting living standards. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> expressed hope that <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s attitudes as prime minister would not be affected by his record as an opponent of the banned union movement `` It's not important where one comes from,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said from his home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> Monday evening. `` What's important is what one comes with ... We hope he will come with pluralism, with a willingness for reform, which is what the country needs.'' <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, an independent parliament deputy, predicted the nomination would not harm the talks with the opposition planned for mid-October. `` Things happening in our country now are so interesting that philosophers never even dreamt of them,'' he said. `` Things are changing fast. Maybe he -LRB- <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> -RRB- will change his opinion of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and Solidarity too.'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, who became the Politburo member in charge of propaganda in December, takes over as prime minister from <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, who resigned Sept. 19 with his entire Cabinet, accused of mishandling the economy. `` I think that <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> is a skilled man, a very good politician,'' said <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojna </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> caucus. But <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, a senior adviser to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, said what matters is whether government policies change: `` If Mr. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> brings a political program of a new open policy of dialogue with the society, then it will be very good.'' As prime minister, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> will face difficult challenges. Confidence in the government has eroded, inflation is running at 60 percent annually, consumer goods are in short supply and workers are restless after staging two punishing waves of strikes this year. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor unrest in seven years ended Sept. 3 when authorities set aside their longstanding opposition to negotiating with Solidarity. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> agreed to call an end to the strikes after the government promised to discuss reinstating the union movement. Then deputy prime minister, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> became unpopular with Solidarity activists as the official responsible for negotiating with the union movement during its legal existence in 1980-81. Although he had been a liberal within the party, he strongly defended the December 1981 military crackdown that suppressed Solidarity, which was banned the next fall. <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Baka </PERSON>, an economist elevated to the Politburo in June, had been considered a hopeful for the prime minister's post. But <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> may have been chosen because the party wanted `` someone with a political, rather than economic, dimension ... And <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> is a politician.'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> served as editor-in-chief of the party weekly Polityka from 1958 to 1982, where he gained a reputation as a progressive and alienated party hardliners. But he was close to <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, serving under him as deputy prime minister from 1981 to 1985. When <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> turned over the prime minister's job to <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> in November 1985, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> also left the government. He held a largely ceremonial parliament post until gaining a seat on the ruling Politburo last year.

 The executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> today accused Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of `` McCarthyite slander'' against the organization during his nationally televised debate Sunday night with Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The official, <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement that the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> is involved in a lawsuit seeking to remove the tax exemption of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is wrong, as is a suggestion that the group favors allowing child pornography. `` That kind of slur, that kind of McCarthyite slander, in characterizing what the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> does, is outrageous and it does not characterize what the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> is about,'' <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON> said on `` CBS This Morning.'' He referred to the 1950s anti-communist campaign of Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, R-Wis., in which many people were tarred as Communist sympathizers without proof There is a court case challenging the Catholic church's tax exemption but the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> is not involved, <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON> said. He said his organization is on record favoring criminal penalties in cases of child pornography. `` The fact is that we are devoted to only one thing, and that is the non-partisan defense of the Bill of Rights,'' <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON> said. `` Sooner or later everybody needs the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>. When your constitutional rights are threatened or violated, you'll come to the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign responded: `` The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> has a well-earned reputation as caring more about criminals' rights and prisoners' rights than they care about victims' rights.'' On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` totally twisted'' the group's positions Sunday night as he sought to portray <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal outside the American mainstream. `` In terms of our day-to-day work over many years, we have consistently acted in a non-partisan way on behalf of some of the most basic principles of the Constitution,'' <PERSON> Dorsen </PERSON> said. `` Our positions are mainstream positions.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has repeatedly attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for being a `` card-carrying member'' of the civil liberties union. In Sunday's debate, he said: `` I do n't want my 10-year-old granddaughter to go into an X-rated movie. ... I do n't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. I do n't want to see the kiddie pornography laws repealed. I do n't want to see ` Under God' come out from our currency. Now, these are all positions of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> and I do n't agree with them. <PERSON> Dorsen </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> does not want 10-year-olds to see pornographic movies, but believes that the movie rating system amounts to illegal censorship. `` We believe that's a decision that should be made by each family,'' he said. He agreed that the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> opposes tax exemptions for churches on the basis that they amount to a government subsidy of religion. He stressed that the organization's position applies to all religious groups, not just the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dorsen </PERSON> also took issue with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` kiddie pornography'' attack, saying, `` Our view is that the government can prosecute the makers of pornography -LRB- for -RRB- the improper use of children for this purpose. We do n't feel that the material itself can be censored.'' Finally, <PERSON> Dorsen </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> has never challenged the use of `` In God We Trust'' on currency, although he agreed that such use is contrary to the organization's principles. `` It's not part of the government's job to promote a religious belief, and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has said that as far back as 1947,'' he said. But <PERSON> Dorsen </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> has never tried to have the words removed from currency. <PERSON> Dorsen </PERSON> also pointed out that the organization recently defended Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, saying the government violated his Fifth Amendment rights when it prosecuted him for his role in the Iran-Contra affair. And, <PERSON> Dorsen </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> is about to file a brief in federal court in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on behalf of former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, saying he is being improperly prosecuted for illegal lobbying.

<DATELINE>ABOARD USS VANDEGRIFT IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sailing into the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> under a full moon, this <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile frigate tried to draw within 900 feet of the supertanker <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, a lumbering 294,739-ton behemoth more than 81 times its size. The purpose, explained the <PERSON> Vandegrift </PERSON>'s skipper, was to see if the little warship could snuggle close enough to the tanker so that together they would appear as one blip on radar screens in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s so-called `` Silkworm Alley. `` It's just something the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> wanted us to try,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Utegaard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, as his ship struggling to maintain 17 knots in the churning wake of the <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>'s 30-foot-wide propeller Utegaard could not know last Saturday that `` Operation Earnest Will'' mission No. 89 would mark the final time a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship would escort a Kuwaiti oil tanker through the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Today, the first U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker to sail without a close escort of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships left <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s main terminal, heading south through waters where peace has prevailed since the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> cease-fire began Aug. 20. Although traveling alone, the 81,283-ton oil products carrier <LOCATION> Surf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> would not be unprotected should trouble arise during its two-day, 550-mile passage through the gulf and <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources said. `` She's on her way, and will be under surveillance at all times,'' one source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. While the <PERSON> Vandegrift </PERSON> trailed the tanker at a distance, for the first time since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> convoy escort policy began July 21, 1987, no warship was sailing directly behind it. However, mine fears remain high following reports that Italian mine-hunters had found an explosive in the <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> gulf </LOCATION> _ the third discovered in five days. The White House announced Monday the reduction of tension since the Iran-Iraq cease-fire had led President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to end the `` tight escort'' operation. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships will continue to be stationed in the gulf, prepared to assist any ship that might need help. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now has 26 ships in the region. Right to the end, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was looking for better ways to conduct an operation in which its ships had already sailed 50,000 miles escorting convoys through the embattled oil artery. The <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, Calif.-based <PERSON> Vandegrift </PERSON> was the <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>'s lone escort for the voyage northward, and earlier had accompanied the 88th mission, a northbound convoy with the 401,382-ton <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>, famous for hitting a mine during the first `` Earnest Will'' mission. The <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>'s encounter with a 500-pound mine apparently laid by the Iranians pointed up what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers such as Utegaard say is `` still the single biggest threat in the gulf.'' Apart from the <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>, no ship under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> escort encountered any difficulty with mines, missiles, aircraft or gunboat attacks. Last Oct. 16, however, an Iranian Silkworm missile attack severely damaged the 81,283-ton tanker <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmadi </PERSON> loading terminal and the ship's American master was badly wounded. The ship, like the <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>, later returned to service. Forty-six Americans have died in the gulf since shortly before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> began escorting ships. On May 17, 1987, an Iraqi fighter jet mistakenly fired two missiles into the frigate USS Stark, killing 37 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailors. Nine Americans died in the gulf after the escorts began _ seven in helicopter crashes and two in the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plane from a carrier support group in <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The cruiser USS Vincennes shot down an Iranian jetliner in the gulf on July 3, killing all 290 people aboard, after crewmen mistook it for an attacking Iranian fighter jet. Although the ostensible purpose of `` Operation Earnest Will'' was to protect the 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers and underscore a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to freedom of navigation, officials say it was motivated greatly by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s concern about growing Soviet influence in the gulf. Some diplomats noted it was only after <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> agreed to lease three tankers to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and give them armed escort protection that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> moved firmly to reflag and escort part of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s fleet. The escort missions proved formidable enough that other foreign ships became `` tag-alongs,' lining up ahead, behind or alongside the American convoys as they traveled the dangerous waters of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> gulf </LOCATION> where Iranian raiders were most active. Some even painted their sterns with American names to dupe Iranian gunners into thinking they were part of the reflagged Kuwaiti fleet.

 Riot police swinging truncheons charged into crowds of rock-hurling leftist militants protesting the World Bank-International Monetary Fund talks. Paramedics said both police and protesters were injured. The street battle took place Monday night after about 1,500 people staged a demonstration downtown to protest what they called unfair financial policies of industrialized nations toward heavily indebted Third World countries. Finance ministers of 22 countries are attending the annual meeting along with thousands of other finance officials. The talks open officially today with a speech by West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. Violence erupted Monday night after police had broken up the demonstration. About 500 radicals blockaded streets leading to the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>, where hundreds were watching a production of <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s `` The Magic Flute'' staged especially for delegates and guests of the financial discussions Some protesters left after warnings by police but others refused to go, witnesses said. A large contingent of helmeted police then moved in, swinging their truncheons as demonstrators hurled rocks, the witnesses said. About 100 demonstrators ran to a square near <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s famed <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilhelm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> where the violence continued. Some protesters were seen being hauled into police vans during the two-hour battle. A police spokesman said he did not know how many people had been arrested or injured. About 2,700 police from across <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have been sent to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to help the city's 6,000-strong police force during the week of financial talks. In talks today, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> urged industrial nations to keep their economies expanding _ but with low inflation _ to help ease the hardships suffered by the heavily indebted poor countries. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> told the annual meeting that the rich countries must be on guard against a fresh surge in prices. `` The central requirement is to avoid the return of inflationary psychology,'' he said in a prepared text of his speech. <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> noted `` a few scattered warning signals,'' including tightening labor markets in some countries and higher prices for some commodities. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, attending the first international policy talks in his new job, also was scheduled to speak today. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank governor, <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON>, was expected to offer details of his country's proposal to help big debtor countries like <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In his speech, <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> appealed to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to reduce its government spending. `` `` Fiscal restraint,'' he said, `` is currently warranted in several countries, most notably the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ...'' `` A stronger budgetary position in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would also help make exchange markets more resilient in the face of unexpected developments,'' he said. `` And it would lower real interest rates, with beneficial effects for indebted countries.'' <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> applauded the industrial nations' decision to lighten the money problems of the poorest debtor countries, mostly in sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and called on bankers and governments to do more for the large debtors. World Bank President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> made an impassioned appeal to wealthy countries to fight world poverty. `` Poverty on today's scale prevents a billion people from having even minimally acceptable standards of living,'' he said in the prepared text of his remarks. `` To allow every fifth human being on our planet to suffer such an existence is a moral outrage,'' he said. The meeting is scheduled to last through Thursday.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is moving quickly to exploit his high points from the presidential debate and distance himself from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. At a rally Monday evening in downtown Journal Square, the Democratic nominee said that during Sunday night's debate, his Republican opponent <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` suggested that I agree with every position ever taken by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` That's nonsense and he knows it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Two months ago I signed one of the toughest child pornography laws in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. Meanwhile, his staff passed out a `` fact sheet'' which said the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> has urged repeal of all child pornography laws. `` I've always supported tax exemptions for religious institutions,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` and I certainly do not support <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> who the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> is defending.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' membership in the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> is one of the issues the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee has raised in an effort to portray the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor as a liberal out of the mainstream of current thinking. During the debate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a `` card-carrying member'' of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, described the group as a liberal organization and attacked some of its positions. `` I do n't want my 10-year-old granddaughter to go into an X-rated movie,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. I do n't want to see the kiddie pornography laws repealed. I do n't want to see ` Under God' come out from our currency. Now, these are all positions of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> and I do n't agree with them.'' <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> officials accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of distorting the organization's positions and engaging in `` McCarthyite slander. <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsen </PERSON> said the group has consistently taken `` mainstream positions'' intended to safeguard constitutional rights. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign fact sheet said the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> has represented people suing the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's administration in an effort to overturn its policies on drunk driving road blocks and a regulation giving homosexuals low priority when seeking to become foster parents. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign officials put together two new television commercials showing excerpts from the debate. One of the 30-second commercials shows <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> talking about college opportunity, health insurance and concluding, `` The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not behind us. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come.'' The second commercial is an excerpt from his closing statement. People interviewed in focus groups after the debate resppnded very favorably to his closing statement. Campaign aides said the commercials would run nationally on the major television networks. At rallies in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for failing to talk about health insurance, college opportunity, Social Security and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offers the easy way,'' said the Democratic nominee. `` He sees no challenges; he offers no solutions, and he will lead <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> nowhere as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He was campaigning today in another key industrial state _ <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> _ with appearances in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Melrose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> landed at <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Monday he got a look at an airplane he hopes one day will be his to use, Air Force One. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had flown into the same airport earlier en route to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was taking advantage of the presence of many world leaders for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> session. He was flying to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Wednesday to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. Before leaving the city the following morning, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also planned to meet with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON>. The meetings are designed to help him counter arguments by the Republicans that he lacks foreign policy experience.

 Four `` <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'' stunt drivers turned into real-life heroes when they chased a man straight to a police station after he ran down an officer directing traffic during filming of the TV show, authorities said. <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamoun </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Calabasas </LOCATION> was arrested Monday after the angry stunt drivers chased him at speeds up to 70 mph for more than a mile to the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> station. `` It's a little ironic,'' said Officer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuckles </PERSON>. `` This guy runs over a ` blue suit' and then he runs to the police station for safety.'' Officer <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuenschwander </PERSON>, 53, was struck while working off-duty in a restaurant parking lot in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, police said. He was in serious but stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> Northridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Witnesses said <PERSON> Shamoun </PERSON>, who worked near the filming site, got angry when told him he could n't drive through a parking lot bustling with movie people. <PERSON> Shamoun </PERSON> appeared to decide to back up, but then the van lurched forward, police Detective <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellante </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Neuenschwander </PERSON> fell while trying to get out of the way and the van ran over his left arm and leg. Four members of the `` <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'' crew jumped into two cars and chased the van as it fled the scene, <PERSON> Bellante </PERSON> said. `` He was getting away with running over a policeman,'' one of the crew members, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Daily </PERSON>, said later. `` That's totally wrong.'' One of the cars eventually cut in front of the van, forcing it to a stop at the curb right in front of the police station, <PERSON> Bellante </PERSON> said. All five men ran into the station where officers stopped the fracas before anyone was injured, <PERSON> Bellante </PERSON> said. `` They came crashing through the front door of the station with this donnybrook going,'' he said. `` Officers jumped over the desk and grabbed them all until they could sort out who was who and what was going on.''

 A former computer programmer on trial for 16 murders was described by a prosecutor as a homosexual who drove on <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> roads for a decade, picking up young hitchhikers and drugging, strangling and mutilating them. During his opening statement Monday, <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> pieced together the last hours of the men <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> is charged with killing. Most were allegedly hitchhikers picked up by <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> in a car stocked with drugs and beer. `` This is a road map of what the evidence will show,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, 43, has pleaded innocent to 16 counts of murder and various other counts of mayhem and sodomy. His trial was delayed 12 times since his arrest more than five years ago. Prosecutors believe they can link him to 21 other slayings and say the death toll may be as high as 60. He has been jailed since May 14, 1983, when a <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> officer stopped him because his car was weaving and found a dying Marine on the passenger seat. Authorities found what they believe was a coded `` score card'' of victims in the car, and 47 color photographs of several young men, many of them nude and apparently posed after they were slain. The evidence shows <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> would bind his drug-dazed victims, choke them with a belt around the neck and have sex with them, the prosecutor said. Many victims were mutilated before they were heaved from a fast-moving car, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s fetish for saving mementos of victims and taking post-death photographs was his undoing, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Defense attorney <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, who responded to the <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s two-hour statement with a 10-minute opening, warned jurors against being swayed by vivid descriptions of the killings. `` These are tactics designed to inflame you,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. `` This is a tactical decision made by the prosecutor. He wo n't be able to prove it. This case is based on suspicion, innuendo and prosecutorial rhetoric. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> detailed the deaths of the 16 victims, six of them Marines and all age 18 to 25. The killings occurred between December 1972 and May 1983.

The 68-year-old bishop, who has headed the diocese since 1974, planned to make the formal announcement at a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> chancery. <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>'s decision was prompted by a decline in his overall medical condition rather than any specific ailment, according to <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutty </PERSON>, director of communications for the diocese. `` The schedule is just too much for a man of his age,'' <PERSON> Mutty </PERSON> said. `` He just does not think he can keep up with the pace it has demanded.'' The announcement followed word from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> that Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> had accepted <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>'s resignation, <PERSON> Mutty </PERSON> said, adding that `` nobody had any inkling of this before this morning.''

 A jury early today convicted a man described by a prosecutor as the `` head dog'' in a gang rape and recommended that he get the maximum term of 20 years. Jurors deliberated about 20 minutes before returning with a recommendation that <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, 24, be given the maximum term for his part as the alleged ringleader. He had also faced a fine of up to $ 10,000 but there was no mention of a fine when the jury's decision was annnounced State District Judge <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> set sentencing for Oct. 17. There was little reaction from the defendant after the decision was read. He declined comment after the court session ended and as he left the <LOCATION> Duval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION> with his lawyers. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, the first of 10 defendants to stand trial in the case, was accused of being the first man to sexually assault the 19-year-old woman on the night of March 26-27. The woman said as many as 23 men raped her after she was forced to go to a ranch where illegal cockfights were being held near this town of about 5,000 people south of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. A counselor who helped the woman at a sex abuse center said she telephoned the victim, who has moved from here, to tell her about the jury's verdict. `` She's happy,'' said counselor <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` She said, ` Thank the Lord.''' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> kept the jury late because he said he wanted the panel to reach a verdict before he left for a judicial conference in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> today. Jurors were told they could go home to get some rest and return for the punishment phase of the trial, but they chose to continue. Defense attorneys urged that <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> get probation, but the Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> asked jurors to recommend the maximum sentence. The prosecutor said he believes that some of the other defendants might want to plea bargain for shorter prison terms as a result of <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>'s sentence. The next trial in the case is scheduled for next month. Final arguments began shortly before midnight before a courtroom packed with more than 150 spectators. Jurors began their deliberations at 2:15 a.m., returning the guilty verdict two hours later. `` To me, it's devastating that a young woman placed herself in a situation where something just extraordinary may have happened,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> said in his final argument to the six-man, six-woman jury. `` She went out there to that cockfight because she wanted to be with this man here,'' said defense counsel <PERSON> Nago </PERSON> <PERSON> Alaniz </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alaniz </PERSON> said the woman fabricated the kidnapping and gang-rape story to protect her reputation and keep her husband from finding out about her illicit sexual activity with <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, who said he had been in an affair with the woman since January. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> on Monday said the woman insisted on having sex with him that night inside the car and later on the hood of the car, and that she refused to leave the ranch when he tried to take her home. All 10 defendants pleaded innocent to charges ranging from kidnapping to sexual assault. But <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said in his final argument that <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> `` was the head dog. He was the one who brought the meat.'' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON> told the jury, `` You all will have to determine if we have to reside in our county with the likes of <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>.'' The week-long trial featured testimony by the victim, her husband and a 12-year-old boy present at the cockfight, who said his family has moved to another city to escape harassment since he presented himself as a witness. `` He was the only one who was man enough to come up here and tell you the truth,'' <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said of the boy while addressing the jury today. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> also faces an aggravated kidnapping trial in the case.

 Arab hospital officials today confirmed the first two Palestinian deaths from plastic bullets, and Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> defended the use of the new ammunition. The deaths followed criticism of the army's tactic of allowing troops to fire plastic bullets more freely at Arab stone throwers. A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> relief agency has protested what it said was a sharp increase in injuries since the plastic bullets went into use. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said plastic bullets were added to the soldiers' arsenal in August after rubber bullets, tear gas and clubs `` proved to be insufficient to cope'' with stone-throwing incidents linked to the 9-month-old uprising in the occupied territories. `` Those who participate in violent activities suffer more casualties in terms of wounded,'' he told a news conference at a military camp in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION>, 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` It did not increase the number of people who are killed.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> added: `` Our purpose is to increase the number -LRB- of wounded -RRB- among those who take part in violent activities but not to kill them.'' Asked about the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> protest, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said his job was to reduce violence in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` Other protests, with all due respect, are of secondary importance to me,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. The first confirmed fatalities from plastic bullets were identified by hospital officials as <PERSON> Osama </PERSON> <PERSON> Braikah </PERSON>, 17, of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> refugee camp, and <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanoun </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Both are in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Braikah </PERSON> was hit by two plastic bullets today during a demonstration by dozens of stone-throwing protesters in his camp, said Dr. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazejeh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. One bullet hit his face, <PERSON> Yazejeh </PERSON> said, `` but a plastic bullet to the heart killed him.'' <PERSON> Yazejeh </PERSON> said he received the information from physicians at <LOCATION> Nasser </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Khan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yunis </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Braikah </PERSON> was declared dead on arrival. A spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Nasser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> also confirmed the fatality was caused by a plastic bullet. The other victim, <PERSON> Zanoun </PERSON>, died Monday after being struck in the chest by a plastic bullet during clashes in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, according to doctors at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The deaths raised to 276 the number of Palestinians killed since the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8. Six Israelis have died. Violence in the occupied territories Monday left two other Palestinians dead and 67 wounded. Today, at least 10 Palestinians were wounded in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, eight with plastic bullets and two with live ammunition, hospital officials said. Army spokesmen have contended plastic bullets, which penetrate the body with less force than live ammunition, are not lethal unless fired from less than 20 yards' distance. Also today, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes attacked Shiite Moslem guerrilla bases in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The army said at least two jet fighters took part in the attack on bases belonging to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, an Iranian-backed Shiite faction. There were no immediate reports on casualties. The attacks near the Lebanese village of <LOCATION> Al-Luwayzah </LOCATION> appeared to be a warning to Shiite extremists following the assassinations last week of three moderate Lebanese leaders. An army spokesman said the target of today's air raid was guerrilla headquarters for planning and executing attacks against Israeli forces and Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> It was the 15th air strike against guerrilla targets in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdrew the bulk of its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in June 1985 after a three-year occupation but maintains a six-to-10-mile wide buffer zone north of the Israeli border.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, refining his plan to break the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> lock, plans to curtail his efforts in several states that appear out of reach while escalating the fight for critical swing states and the major battleground of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, according to campaign aides. In all, the states in which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides concede their chances of defeating Republican nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are slim carry roughly 100 of the 538 possible <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> votes, with 270 needed to win the White House. One <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the campaign would begin `` pulling back budget and pulling back staff'' and saving the resources for states that are closer to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' reach `` Decisions are being made about every state, about where it's best to schedule visits and where it would be more productive for us to be spending time and money,'' another aide said `` Clearly there are certain places where we would be better off dedicating our resources.'' Considered high among those is <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with 29 electoral votes and where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> currently holds a lead in the polls. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his running mate, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, plan an aggressive campaign there, including ads asking what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has done for his adopted home state and highlighting <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ties, said a third aide. Two of the advisers pointed to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' recent travel schedule as evidence of the refined strategy and said it was a good barometer for states considered competitive. `` The governor is committed to a 50-state campaign and so are we, but we all understand what drives a schedule and we are working on it together to make the sound strategic decisions,'' said one of them. By that measure, most of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> states appear to have been de-emphasized. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has campaigned extensively in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and will return there this week, but he has visited <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, which has 21 electoral votes, only once in the past several weeks. He has visited <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> one time each, briefly, and has not been to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made two stops in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> several weeks ago but has not returned. He has not visited <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> since the Democratic convention in July, although he is expected to do so in the next few weeks in an effort to keep the race competitive there. In contrast, he has been to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> at least twice since the convention, and aides say those states, along with <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, are considered more competitive, as is <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. Turning West, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> strategists concede they have little hope for carrying traditionally <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> in the farm belt, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s home state of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides say they will not outright concede any state but, with six weeks to go before the election, must make decisions on where best to allocate staff and money. If internal tracking shows a significant shift among voters in any of the states now being de-emphasized, the plan could again be revised, the aides said. `` We track this stuff very carefully and will be ready to respond if we see a new opportunity somewhere,'' said one aide involved in targeting decisions. `` By keeping it competitive, if we can, we keep the Republicans spending time and resources. You see where we are by looking at the schedule but that does n't mean we do n't keep targets of opportunity open.'' If paid staffers are relocated, the campaign will rely on volunteers to maintain a presence in all 50 states, that aide said. The current plan is to target two of the largest electoral prizes, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and the traditionally Democratic states in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The race in many of those states is very tight, another factor in decisions to reallocate resources, the aides said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which ranks second only to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in electoral votes, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> carry a total of 179 votes, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hopes to win most of them and offset any losses with victories in the border states. Despite the decision to de-emphasize some states, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides are convinced they can break the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> electoral lock by reclaiming the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and picking up the rest of the needed votes from other states that supported President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the last two elections. `` Whether it's in the border states or the far West, it's clear that it's very different this time,'' said one aide. `` The opportunity is clearly there.''

<HEAD>Reagan Says He Would Never Deny US Advisers in El Salvador Right
to Defend Selves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked about a firefight involving guerrillas and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said today he would never deny the advisers `` the right to defend themselves.'' In the incident two weeks ago, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advisers to the Salvadoran army found themselves in the middle of a rebel attack on an army headquarters, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. Maj. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said that the advisers `` fired in self defense'' and that none was injured. `` They were caught in the middle of a fire fight and their own lives were in jeopardy, so they fired in self defense,'' she said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked about the incident during a picture-taking session with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, replied, `` I'll never send any of our people into danger without allowing them the right to defend themselves if they are attacked.'' The Washington Post and the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> in editions today quoted a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> memorandum as saying 16 Salvadoran soldiers and five guerrillas were killed in the assault at the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 4th Brigade headquarters in <LOCATION> north </LOCATION> <LOCATION> central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Here is how the memorandum described the action, according to the published reports: `` During the attack, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel positioned themselves in a sandbagged and reinforced bunker position adjacent to the trainer quarters. From this position, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel could observe guerrillas moving about surrounding high ground and firing their weapons at, or in the general direction of, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel. `` Perceiving a direct threat to their safety, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel engaged the guerrillas with their assigned personal weapons.'' It was not known specifically whether the three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers killed anyone. They reportedly returned fire with M-16 rifles. `` There are no indications of guerrilla casualties as a result of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defensive fire,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, as writing in the memo. The encounter occurred Sept. 13, but word of it surfaced Monday because the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> referred to it in a report it is required to send to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> whenever a hostile action in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> involves an American, the spokeswoman said Monday. She said she had not seen the memo referred to in the published reports. The same Salvadoran army headquarters was the site of a fierce gun and mortar battle in late March 1987, resulting in the death of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sergeant. Army Sgt. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Fronius </PERSON>, 27, an intelligence specialist who was advising the Salvadoran army, is the only soldier reported killed while on duty in the midst of combat during the eight years of civil war in the country. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers arrived in the country in 1981. <PERSON> Fronius </PERSON> was one of two advisers assigned to the camp at the time of the 1987 attack. The other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier was away.

 A young man accused in a school shooting spree that left an 8-year-old girl dead and 10 people wounded had been in and out of a hospital psychiatric ward over the past eight months, relatives said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who was arrested following Monday's violence at <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, is a hyperactive recluse fascinated by crime stories, his father and a grandmother said The 19-year-old <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> man entered the school shortly after 11 a.m. Monday and opened fire in a classroom and the cafeteria, killing <PERSON> Shequila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawonn </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and wounding two teachers and eight pupils, said Police Chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON>. `` He seemed to be shooting people who were screaming,'' said School Superintendent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>. `` The teacher said those who were screaming or making noise, he shot them.'' The school in this city of about 20,000 people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s textile belt 74 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> remained closed today. Authorities had no motive for the shooting, said <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON>. At an arraignment this morning, city Recorder <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Windham </PERSON> denied bond on the murder charge. Retired state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Littlejohn </PERSON>, acting as a special judge, ordered <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> sent to <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> for psychiatric examation. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> had been admitted to Self Memorial Hospital's psychiatric ward three or four times in the past eight months, his father, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, and paternal grandmother, <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, said in interviews with The State newspaper. They said he had not returned more recently because the family's medical insurance ran out The hefty, 5-foot-5 man, who is known as `` <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>,'' is bright and shy, and does n't have many friends, they said. `` He was hyperactive, really more than hyperactive,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he liked going to the hospital because they gave him drugs, his father said, adding that until two months ago the young man had been taking medication for depression. The young man was not employed. He `` just did n't have the ability,'' his father said. His parents divorced last year. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> had been living with his grandmother off and on since he was 14 and permanently the last two yars. He would keep himself sequestered in his bedroom and surrounded by books, Mrs. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` He kept the blinds closed. He liked it to be dark,'' she said. Lately, he'd been reading numerous crime books, she said. His father, a welder, said he first learned of his son's arrest when he returned home from work Monday. `` It just does n't make no sense,'' he said. The wounded teachers, <PERSON> Kat </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON>, were listed in fair condition today at Self Memorial. A 7-year-old pupil was in critical condition and another was in fair condition. Six other pupils were treated for superficial gunshot wounds and released Monday, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Branyon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shequila </PERSON> died of a gunshot wound to the neck, said <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Odell </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>. `` There would have been a great deal more injury and loss of life if it had not been for these brave teachers and the way they conducted themselves,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> walked through the school's front door, went to the cafeteria and opened fire with a .22 - caliber, nine-shot revolver, wounding one teacher and three He left the cafeteria and entered a girl's restroom to reload his weapon. Ms. <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON> followed and attempted to prevent him from leaving the room, <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON> said. In the scuffle that followed, Ms. <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON> was shot in the mouth and hand. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> evaded Ms. <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON> and entered a classroom, where he opened fire again, wounding five students and killing <PERSON> Shequila </PERSON>, <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON> said. After emptying his pistol, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> dropped the weapon. Ms. <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON> told him to raise his hands and stand until a police officer arrived, the chief said. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said he knew of no connection between the gunman and the school. `` It appears to be an entirely random incident,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. Officials will try to help students and teachers recover from the nightmare, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. The district will provide teachers with counseling today, he said, and children will receive counseling when they return Wednesday.

<HEAD>High Failure Rate On Exam Could Add To Shortage, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Health industry officials fear that the high failure rate of people who took the national nursing exam in July foretells a worsening in an already serious nursing shortage. `` We're in a real bind,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Massie </PERSON>, chief operating officer of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where 29 of 73 nursing graduates hired over the summer failed the test. Nursing-school graduates can work as registered nurses until their test results arrive, but those who fail lose their positions. Nationally, 16.4 percent of individuals who took the two-day exam for the first time in July failed, said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Yocom </PERSON>, director of research services for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION>, which prepares the exam. Partly because of changes in the test and the way it is scored, that is the highest failure rate since the council started the exam in 1982, she said. Last year, only 9 percent of first-time test takers failed, and in previous years the failure rate ranged from 8 percent to 12 percent, <PERSON> Yocom </PERSON> said. The failure rate increased in all 50 states, she said. In <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, then failure rate was about 20 percent of first-time test takers, up from 10 prcemt last year, said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Calico </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION>. `` This just exacerbates the -LRB- shortage -RRB- problem,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON>, vice president for member services of the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. A survey it did in 1987 found that one in 10 registered-nurse positions in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> hospitals was unfilled. The <ORGANIZATION> UK </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> has closed three intensive-care-unit beds because it did n't have enough nurses, <PERSON> Massie </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION>, said she worries that the bad results will scare young people away from a nursing career. This year's test has been changed to cover new subjects because of the changing skills and knowledge required of entry-level nurses, <PERSON> Yocom </PERSON> said. Also, the number of correct answers needed to pass the test was increased, but by fewer than 10 out of the total of 300 questions asked, she said. The Chicago-based council wo n't reveal how many correct answers are needed to pass the test. <PERSON> Yocom </PERSON> said the council expected the failure rate to increase, but not by as much as it did, and said changes in the exam accounted for only half the increase. She theorized that increasing opportunities for women in other professions, night and weekend hours in many health-care settings, and non-competitive salaries have prompted fewer top-quality people to enter nursing. The <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> has asked the national council to offer the exam three times a year instead of the current two so nurses can get into the work force more quickly. The next scheduled exam is in February, and by the time those results come out the nurses who failed in July but pass in February will not be able to start work as registered nurses until about April.

<HEAD>Security Forces Find Huge Arsenal Of Terrorist Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Security forces found a large arsenal of weapons, including a Soviet-made rocket launcher, hidden in underground bunkers, police said today. The Royal Ulster Constabulary said `` a number of people'' were arrested for questioning about the caches, discovered on Monday and today around <LOCATION> Strabane </LOCATION>, <PERSON> County </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON>, near <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s northwest border with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> `` Security forces have found a huge arsenal of terrorist weapons,'' a police statement said. The haul included a Soviet RPG-7 rocket launcher and two warheads, more than 1,000 pounds of homemade explosives, two Soviet-made AKM assault rifles, one shotgun, a large quantity of ammunition and detonators, explosive fuses and propellant charges, police said. The arms were concealed in 40-gallon drums that had been welded together and buried in elaborately constructed bunkers under a hillside, police said. `` It is obvious that people within our community were fully aware of the presence of these caches,'' said a police spokesman, who requested anonymity. `` Where human life is being taken so frequently it is long past time that those who are aware of such activity should act more responsibly.'' The spokesman urged citizens to report any information about terrorist activities or arms so that `` lives can be saved.'' Last week, Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermon </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, said the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> `` has very considerable quantities of very powerful weaponry which they have not yet used,'' including surface-to-air missiles. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is believed to have supplied the weapons to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> for its fight to oust the British from Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the province with the mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republic. This year a series of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attacks in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have killed 27 British soldiers and 11 guerrillas. Since November, 20 civilians have died in bungled <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> operations.

<HEAD>Sugar-Based Chemicals May One Day Prevent Plaque, Scientist Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Laboratory studies suggest chemicals that tantalize the sweet tooth may actually help prevent cavities, says a chemist who hopes to develop a tooth-protecting sugar substitute. The chemicals are derived from table sugar and are called `` glucans mimics'' because they imitate glucans, a sticky substance that is the major component of plaque, which adheres to teeth to cause cavities. Laboratory studies showed that the chemicals took the place of real glucans to block the plaque-forming activity of enzymes produced by bacteria found in the human mouth, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> chemist <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said Monday during the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s national meeting. Although the chemicals have n't yet been tested in animals or people and are not yet able to permanently block the cavity-causing enzymes, similar substances might be developed for use in commercial toothpaste and mouthwashes. That would probably take about eight years `` under the best circumstances,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. If an intensely sweet plaque-preventing compound can be developed, `` you can use it as a sugar substitute,'' he said. An <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> news release called <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s research `` a major step toward preventing cavity-causing dental plaque,'' but other scientists were more cautious `` It's basic research, and we ca n't tell how long before something may come to fruition,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciardi </PERSON>, a cavity research program administrator at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. `` This is all test-tube work,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON>, periodontics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dentistry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Something that works in the lab is n't necessarily going to work on an animal, be it a human or laboratory animal,'' The method now used to stop plaque from causing cavities is to remove the material by brushing and flossing teeth and using mouth rinses to help break down plaque to ease removal, <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> said Bacteria in the mouth use their own enzymes and sugar in food to make glucans. More food particles and bacteria then stick to the glucans to form plaque. Sugars in the food are converted to acid, which dissolves tooth enamel and damages material beneath the enamel to create cavities. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said his studies focused on finding or making glucans mimics, which are artificial forms of glucans. In the test-tube experiments, glucans mimics hooked onto the decay-causing bacteria, preventing real glucans from doing so, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. That prevented the bacteria from making chemicals that give plaque its structure, he said. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and his colleagues said they have found or developed different chemicals that mimic glucans. They include synthetic chemicals derived from table sugar, hydrogen peroxide and vitamin B6. Glucans-mimicking chemicals also are `` a lot more expensive than flouride, which is fairly effective in reducing cavities,'' he said. If scientists develop such chemicals that prevent plaque in humans, they may be economical only for people who suffer a condition in which flouride harms rather than protects their teeth, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> added. The chemistry group said Americans now spend about $ 16 billion a year for the diagnosis and treatment of cavities.

 Army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, fired four colonels today in a shakeup aimed at purging supporters of former President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, whose appointment as prime minister last Thursday pushed the country closer to formal partition, also reportedly banned helicopter flights to and from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in suburban <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily newspaper Ad-Diyar said the embassy was told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters may only land or take off from the army base in <LOCATION> Adma </LOCATION>, six miles north of the embassy compound. The report could not be confirmed immediately. Police, meanwhile, said three bombs exploded in Syrian-policed Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Monday, wounding one civilian and destroying several shops and cars. There was no claim of responsibility for the blasts, the sixth and seventh bombings in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> prime minister. The military shakeup, apparently aimed at consolidating <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s power within the army, brought his most trusted aides to top military posts The shakeup preceded the first meeting of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Cabinet, which <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed before his six-year term ended at midnight Thursday <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s government has been rejected by the Moslem majority, which recognizes ony the Cabinet of acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> today issued a directive dismissing Col. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassis </PERSON>, head of the army's intelligence branch, and appointed Col. <PERSON> Amer </PERSON> <PERSON> Shehab </PERSON> to replace him. The general also dismissed the commander of the presidential guards, Col. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassis </PERSON>. He was replaced by Col. <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Zein </PERSON>. Maj. <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashkar </PERSON> was appointed head of the army's security apparatus, replacing Col. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahwan </PERSON>. Col. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaidan </PERSON>, the only Moslem among the four men dismissed today, was fired from his post as head of the army's strategic planning branch <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> did not name his successor. Maronite Christians have dominated power since <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, holding the presidency, the army command, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> governorship and the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> But under an unwritten covenant, prime ministers have been Sunni Moslems and parliament speakers have been Shiite Moslems. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a Christian, took over after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> failed repeatedly to muster the needed quorum of 51 deputies to convene and elect a successor to <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. The Moslem officers named to serve in <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s six-man military <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> refused to take up their posts, leaving the general with only two ministers in addition to himself.

<HEAD>Methodist Minister In Soweto Detained By Police</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police detained a Methodist minister today in an early morning raid, claiming he violated a ban on calls for an election boycott, his wife and church colleagues said. The Rev. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbanane </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> was taken into custody as the Methodist and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches released the text of pastoral letters urging their followers to consider refusing to vote in the Oct. 26 nationwide municipal elections. <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbabane </PERSON> said her 55-year-old husband was taken from his home in the black township at 12:45 a.m. by officers who alleged he had preached against participation in the October elections. Mrs. <PERSON> Mbabane </PERSON> said her husband had not advocated an election boycott but had conveyed the <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal to its congregations to consider carefully whether they should vote. <LOCATION> Mbabane </LOCATION> is a regional vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The chairman of his district, the Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Storey </PERSON>, said in a statement: `` The authorites must have taken leave of their senses to remove someone of Mr. <PERSON> Mbabane </PERSON>'s stature and integrity from <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> at this tense time.'' The pastoral letter from Methodist leaders said abstention from voting would be the only way for some voters to convey their rejection of apartheid. `` Only candidates who are openly and sincerely committed to the complete abolition of apartheid are worthy of Christian support,'' the letter said. A similar letter issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> said the elections could further entrench apartheid. The elections will mark the first time South Africans of all races go to the polls the same day. Most anti-apartheid activists oppose participation in segregated local elections as long as the black majority is excluded from full participation in national elections. Numerous activist clergymen, including Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, have defied a state-of-emergency regulation forbidding calls for an election boycott. State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, some forms of protest, and a range of statements the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations has not been comprehensive. Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> boasted today that he's successfully pasted a liberal label on Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and declared that `` I'm going to keep on using it'' in their tight campaign race for the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also told several thousand students at a <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> rally on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> campus that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is inexperienced in foreign affairs. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't need a president who has to enroll in Foreign Policy 101 to understand the kind of world we live in,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked, `` How did I do?'' in his nationally televised debate with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Sunday, and the reply was a roar of approval from the crowd. About three dozen protesters waving pro-Dukakis signs and chanting `` Where Was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' were kept several hundred feet away and out of earshot from the platform where the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee spoke. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was successful in portraying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> during the debate as a liberal who stands far to the left of most Americans. `` We smoked him out,'' he said. `` For most of the campaign the man I call the stealth candidate has tried to hide where he stands,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The vice president said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did n't like it when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used `` the big L word,'' referring to the word liberal. `` I'm going to keep on using it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He's just itching to spend money and he wants to set the clock back to those days of misery and malaise, and I'm not going to let him do it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Expanding on that theme, the vice president criticized the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor Monday for his membership in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> during campaign stops in the South. Aides said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would drive the point home today on a tour that also took him to a Republican convention in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and a rally at <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION>. Ky.. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned Wednesday to take an eight-hour bus trip through <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> `` My values are your values and they are not the values of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a rally and barbecue on Monday at a farm in <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. He spoke as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, at a campaign appearance in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said he did not agree with all positions taken by the civil liberties' organization `` and he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- knows it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stressed his support for tough laws against child pornography, his support for tax exemptions for churches and other charitable organizations, and his opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s support of former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a key figure in the Iran-Contra scandal. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides voiced delight with what they viewed as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' squirming on the issue `` My advice to him is, make my day, come south,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, predicting the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> issue would loom even larger in the days to come in the South and other conservative rural areas. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he thinks his Sunday night showdown with the Democratic presidential nominee was probably a draw _ contradicting an array of senior aides who crowned him the clear victor. `` I kind of thought it was even,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters. However, he also said he thought the debate `` turned out pretty well.'' At a joint appearance in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, with <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candiate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> voiced strong praise for his running mate and urged supporters to `` stay tuned'' for next week's vice presidential debate in which he predicted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would do well <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> declared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the winner of the debate, which he called `` the nice man versus the ice man'' and said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would have been `` better off to take advice from his friends at the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> and exercised his right to remain silent.'' Over and over, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his lieutenants drove home the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> issue. In particular, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> speech accused the organization of opposing penalties for distributing child pornography and of advocating the legalization of drugs `` including crack and heroin.'' `` I do n't think that is the American way,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` It is not my way. It is the way of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>.'' In the same speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that, `` To wrap up that Democratic nomination, he -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- had to stay where he's been in his entire political life _ and that is on the left side of things. And now he's trying to move back and pre-empt the mainstream in the middle.'' `` I will not let him do that. I'm going to make him be what he is, not what he wants to be,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, a retired army officer who broke with strongman <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> and became the country's leading dissident, today was named chairman of a newly formed opposition alliance. The alliance urged workers to continue a general strike until they achieved their goal of democracy. The strike began Sept. 18 when <PERSON> Gen </PERSON>. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power in a military coup. In another development, the government said today that 348 people had been killed in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> since the coup. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> estimated earlier that as many as 400 people were killed by the government in the days following the coup. Government spokesman <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> told a press briefing that 219 others had been wounded and 1,107 arrested by authorities. Widespread rioting broke out when <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power, and the general immediately ordered troops into the streets to quell the protests. The government spokesman also said rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have launched major attacks against army outposts in northeastern <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, killing 44 government soldiers and wounding 92. The fighting, said to be continuing in some areas, involved both government air strikes and fierce infantry clashes with bayonets. The spokesman for the opposition alliance said another former military officer, <PERSON> Tin </PERSON> <PERSON> Oo </PERSON>, was named vice chairman of the League for Democracy while <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, daughter of a revered <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> independence hero, was chosen general secretary. The three figures formed the league Saturday and immediately called on all citizens to join in a peaceful struggle against the new military regime. The alliance marks the first formal opposition attempt to unify under one leadership the millions of students, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, workers and professionals who have taken to the streets over the past two months to demand an end to 26 years of repressive one-party rule. The new opposition league demands than an interim government be created to lead <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> out of chaos. `` We still believe that an interim government is the only way to solve the present crisis in the country ... to revive stalled government, to reactivate the broken-down economy and to hold genuine, free and fair general elections,'' <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> said today. The alliance also named nine members of a 12-member executive committee. The three remaining positions are to be filled later by representatives of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s numerous ethnic minorities, who are also fighting the government. The alliance later will elect a 37-member governing body, which will include one representative from each of the seven states where ethnic minorities predominate _ <LOCATION> Arakan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kachin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kayah </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> and Mon. The 70-year-old <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> earlier this year circulated a series of letters to former leader <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, criticizing the government's economic performance and its brutal suppression of student demonstrations last March <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, who broke with Ne Win in 1963 over economic policy, was jailed for several years in the 1960s and again briefly this summer when hardliner <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> assumed power after Ne Win resigned. Tin Oo, 61, was removed by <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> as defense and army chief in 1976 and was later jailed in connection with an alleged anti-government plot. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, 42, is the daughter of the late <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, the much revered hero of <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> independence from <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. She had been living in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> but returned to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> for a visit earlier this year and stayed to campaign for democracy. Analysts say the three, who had trouble cooperating in the past, were pressed to unite by the bloody crackdown on dissent following <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s coup. Since the coup, demonstrations have ceased in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and some students have fled to the rugged frontier with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to seek refuge with ethnic minority insurgents. On Monday, top officials appealed to parents and teachers to stop the students from linking up with the rebels.

 Canadian <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> left the Olympics today `` in a complete state of shock,'' accused of cheating with drugs in the world's fastest 100-meter dash and stripped of his gold medal. The prize went to American <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. Many athletes accepted the accusation that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> used a muscle-building but dangerous and illegal anabolic steroid called stanozolol as confirmation of what they said they know has been going on in track and field. `` Everybody uses drugs,'' said sprinter <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Dove-Edwin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION>. `` Give me a break ... they have everything. Human blood hormone, all kinds of drugs. Steroids is nothing anymore. It is just an itty-bitty drug. You can get it anywhere.'' Red-eyed and visibly distraught, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> in suburban <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, refused to believe the accusation. `` If you could cut him into a million pieces and test him over again, my brother is not on drugs,'' she said. Two tests of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s urine sample proved positive and his denials of drug use were rejected today. Neither a spiked sarsparilla in his track bag, as his coach suggested, nor a switched sample at the lab could have accounted for the levels of steroids found in the tests, officials said. In a middle-of-the-night meeting with Olympic and Canadian officials, family members, coach and manager, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 26, forfeited his most prized possession, the medal he'd had in his hands for only three days. The world's fastest human also was automatically suspended from international competition for two years and banned from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s national team for life `` He appeared to be in a complete state of shock and not comprehending the situation,'' said <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s chief of mission, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Letheren </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> was not able to discuss or articulate anything at that moment ... He was just not able to speak and it was a very difficult moment for all of us.'' A few hours later, he fled to the airport and boarded a plane to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Once there, he made his way through a crush of reporters without comment as some spectators applauded. He took a limousine to <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for a flight to his <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> home. `` This is a blow for the Olympic Games and the Olympic movement,'' said International Olympic Committee President <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Samaranch </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said the scandal was a `` personal tragedy for <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> and his family. It's also a moment of great sorrow for all Canadians.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Worrall </PERSON>, a Canadian member of the <ORGANIZATION> IOC </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> `` has been killed'' as an athlete. He said the sprinter's once-favored status as a hero to many sports fans in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, his native <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, and around the world now will be tarnished. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s name will go down in Olympic history with other athletes who lost their gold medals, such as decathlete <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON> in 1912 because he played semi-pro baseball and swimmer <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMont </PERSON> in 1972 because he took an asthma medicine. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> did not gloat over his rival's fall. `` I feel sorry for <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> and for the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> people,'' he said today. `` <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> is a great competitor and I hope he is able to straighten out his life and return to competition.'' He said he did not want `` to fuel this controversy'' by commenting further. After Saturday's race, though, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> had said he could n't understand how <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> could run as fast as he did after looking tired in qualifying heats <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> has previously alleged widespread drug use in track and field. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugal </PERSON>, a Canadian member of the <ORGANIZATION> IOC </ORGANIZATION> medical commission, called stanozolol `` one of the most dangerous anabolic steroids. It has the effect of leading to a number of disturbances of the liver, including cancer.''

 A federal judge ruled that an American Indian accused of hostage-taking must act as his own attorney, a decision the man's lawyer called a `` disgrace.'' <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s trial opened Monday but his lawyer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>, was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at a trial expected to last until mid-October. `` The court is ready to proceed and will proceed with this trial,'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> declined to be represented in court by two attorneys other than <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> has chosen to defend himself,'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> announced. `` No, your honor, I have had that decision forced on me against my constitutional rights,'' <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> replied. Jury selection in the trial continued today. By midmorning, <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> had questioned 43 jurors and excused 15, including two who said they were `` unalterably in favor'' of <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and the trial's other defendant, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> Both potential jurors said they had some American Indian ancestry. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, 20, are charged with taking up to 20 hostages and possessing illegal firearms in a 10-hour siege at The Robesonian newspaper office Feb. 1 in <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION>. The hostages were released unharmed when Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> agreed to appoint a state task force to investigate the defendants' allegations of drug trafficking and racial discrimination among county law enforcement officials No evidence of drug trafficking has been found. The trial opened with <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> at one table with his three lawyers and their two staff members, while <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> sat alone at another table. Before jury selection could start, a <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> law professor who is counseling <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakell </PERSON>, argued that the trial should be delayed until <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>, a prominent attorney known for his defense of leftist causes, could be in the courtroom. <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> denied the request. Then the federal judge ruled that an associate of <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>'s who was present, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, would be <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s trial attorney, despite Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s argument that she was representing <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> only before the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> refused to participate in the trial and walked out of the courtroom just before the lunch recess. In court after the break, <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> if he would accept either Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> or <PERSON> Nakell </PERSON> as his trial attorney. `` Mr. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, do you want to fire Mr. <PERSON> Nakell </PERSON> or keep him?'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> replied, `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> is my attorney, and I feel like I'm being forced to make this decision, and my constitutional rights are being violated.'' <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> criticized the federal judge, saying it was `` a disgrace'' for a federal judge to deny a defendant the counsel of his choice and calling the decision `` a wicked and misleading charade.''

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to join <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in creating a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which would use a disputed Siberian radar base as its eye on the heavens. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested earlier this month that the Soviet radar base at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, be turned over to an international agency for the peaceful exploration of space. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the radar base violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and must be demolished. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said in his speech today to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should join the Soviets in the space agency and donate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> radar units in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the latest Soviet diplomatic initiative was sincere, and that he wanted to make the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> a `` unique global center for ensuring universal and regional security, and the security of each country.'' The Western allies, which regard the Soviet proposal as a new organizational plan that would replace the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Charter, are reluctant to tinker with the existing structure of the world body. Last year, the Soviets were unable to win a majority of votes in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> when they introduced the plan as a resolution. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also said the U.S.-Soviet treaty to scrap all intermediate-range nuclear missiles should be supplemented by an agreement limiting the spread of military missile technology that `` could be worked out only under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.'' On conventional arms, the Soviet diplomat suggested the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> register all conventional arms sales and transfers. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> called for an expanded role for the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, suggesting periodic meetings of its foreign ministers and that it meet in areas of regional tensions. In the last 18 months, increased U.S.-Soviet cooperation has allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to act unanimously on major issues including the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> peace plan in Resolution 598, and in denouncing the use of chemical weapons in the gulf war. Turning to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said `` the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords are not just an isolated local instance of a regional conflict settlement. ... They are a new promising beginning in world politics, attesting to a qualitative change in poltiical thinking.'' Under those U.N.-mediated accords, Soviet troops are to be out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15 in a withdrawal that began May 15. <PERSON> Shevardnaze </PERSON> also called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nations to join the Soviets in abolishing some planned or ongoing military programs and channel the funds toward setting up an international system of environmental security. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also acknowledged President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech Monday in which the president noted U.S.-Soviet cooperation had contributed to breakthroughs in regional security. `` Here I can only agree with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remrks yesterday about the beneficial impact of Soviet-American political dialogue on that process,'' he said. On Monday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> delivered a mostly conciliatory, upbeat farewell speech before the world body he had in the past chastised for its alleged anti-Western attitudes. The president condemned the use of outlawed chemical weapons in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war and called for a new global ban on such warfare. He indirectly criticized <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of poison gas against its Kurdish minority and against Iranians. Kurdish rebels have long been fighting for a separate homeland in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and sided with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the war. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called on all nations to convene a conference that would consider ways to enforce the 1925 protocol barring chemical weapons in international conflicts. He also urged nations to cooperate in negotiating a verifiable global ban on chemical weapons at the Conference on Disarmament in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for negotiating a cease-fire in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war and for opening talks to formalize a peace treaty. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators were making steady progress on an accord to halve the superpowers' long-range, or strategic, nuclear arsenals. While completion of the pact this year was `` highly doubtful,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I can tell you a year from now is a possibility, more than a possibility.''

 <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> sprinter who elated Canadians by winning the 100-meter dash at the Olympics, again drew an outpouring of emotion from his adopted land after he was stripped of his gold medal for using drugs. `` It puts a dent in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, a 10th grader in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>. Canadians watched the Jamaican-born <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> shoot to a 9.79-second world record in the 100-meter race Saturday and win <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> its first gold medal in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. But today, a disappointed nation awaited the return of the burly sprinter after a urine sample was found to contain traces of anabolic steroids. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who was disqualified from the Olympic Games on Monday and stripped of the gold medal, was to return to <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> this afternoon. Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, who Saturday thanked <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> for the `` thrill of a lifetime'' in a nationally-televised telephone call to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, said his disqualification was `` a moment of great sorrow for all Canadians.'' Calling the incident `` a national embarrassment,'' Sports Minister <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Charest </PERSON> said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> will be banned from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s national team for life `` A few days ago, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> had the opportunity of having a great day of national pride,'' <PERSON> Charest </PERSON> told reporters.

He has n't got the guile to do that,'' said <PERSON> Fergus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilmartin </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Coquitlam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` I feel terribly sad for him.'' Some Canadian athletes expressed sympathy for <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokowski </PERSON>, a teammate at the 1984 Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said: `` <PERSON> Ben </PERSON>'s a pretty simple guy. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> does not do drugs. He did not knowingly do this.'' But Canadian speedskater <PERSON> Gaetan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> judged the sprinter harshly, saying he has `` no respect'' for an athlete who takes drugs. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> won two gold medals at the 1984 Winter Games in <LOCATION> Sarajevo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A grand jury has decided that <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, whose case brought allegations of a racist coverup, fabricated her story that she was gang raped by white men, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The special state grand jury found overwhelming evidence that the black, 16-year-old Wappinger Falls girl lied and helped create the condition in which she was found, possibly because she feared she would be beaten at home, the newspaper said. The evidence was assembled over seven months by a grand jury that was unable to obtain testimony from <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, who was found Nov. 28 smeared with feces, dazed, and with racial slurs written on her body. Her story attracted national attention. Prominent people who spoke sympathetically of her plight included heavyweight boxing champion <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> and actor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, who put up a $ 25,000 reward. Civil rights organizations cited the case as an example of racism and unfairness in the criminal justice system, while Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> refused to cooperate with investigators and the grand jury. An adviser to the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> family, the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> report today, calling it `` nothing but a whole succession of reckless speculations that are not backed up with one iota of fact.'' The Times said that more than 100 witnesses and exhibits, including confidential medical and police reports and secretly taped telephone conversations, were considered by the grand jury, which was empaneled in <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION> on Feb. 29. The newspaper said the grand jury was expected within weeks to issue a final report saying it has found no evidence of any abduction, racial or sexual attack or any other crime against Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> has moved with her family to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where she is attending high school. Their telephone number is unpublished, and neither the Times nor The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> could reach the family for comment. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON>, defied a subpoena in June and was sentenced to 30 days in jail, but avoided the sentence by taking refuge in churches and finally leaving the state. The grand jury also subpoenaed Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> but has abandoned hope of ever hearing her story firsthand and rescinded its vote to subpoena her, the <ORGANIZATION> Poughkeepsie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s other two advisers, lawyers <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>, could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s phone went unanswered, while a message left at <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>' residence was not immediately returned. The advisers have alleged a coverup by white officials who refuse to prosecute whites for raping a young black. The Times said the grand jury specifically will clear <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagones </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> assistant prosecutor, as well as other law enforcement officials whom <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> advisers have accused of participating in the alleged attack. The grand jury concluded that contrary to the teen-ager's claim that she was abducted Nov. 24, she had chosen not to return home and hid for the next four days in a nearby apartment from which her family had recently been evicted, the Times said. It said she, possibly with the help of an accomplice, smeared herself with dog feces, wrote racial slurs on her body, tore and scorched her clothes and crawled into a garbage bag and pretended to be in a traumatized daze, the newspaper said. For weeks, she misled doctors, social workers, police, reporters and concerned community people with medical complaints and false and fragmentary accounts of her fabricated episode of horror and then refused to cooperate to cover up her actions, the Times reported based on the grand jury findings. The grand jury speculated that she may have feared her mother's boyfriend for her late nights out and that drugs and her relationships with shady characters may have played a role, the Times said Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s boyfriend, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, had a history of violence, the newspaper said, including serving seven years in jail for killing his wife in 1970. The grand jury said there was evidence he had beaten Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, and that Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> had also beaten her daughter.

<HEAD>Thompson Seeks More Control Over Chicago School Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> is asking the legislature for changes in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> school reform legislation that would, among other things, give him more power over a board that is to oversee the reform process. The governor says his proposed changes in the legislation would further the bill's goal of shifting power to the local school level. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> signed the legislation Monday in an amendatory veto, a procedure under <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law in which a bill is sent back to the legislature for consideration of the governor's written changes or amendments. `` The legislation radically reforms the administrative structure in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in terms of budgeting and planning,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said in a statement. `` I believe that the changes suggested today will make this bill stronger and that a majority of people throughout the city and state agree with me.'' Some legislative supporters of the bill said they could accept <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s suggestions. But <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> raised objections to changes that would affect some teachers' seniority rights, and some black lawmakers took issue with the proposed expansion of the governor's power. Perhaps the most significant change sought by <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> would increase his authority over the seven-member <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oversight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, a body created to ensure that the reform measures are put into place. The original bill called for four authority members to be appointed by the mayor of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and three by the governor. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s version would give the governor and the mayor three appointments each, with the seventh member to be chosen jointly. Among <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s other proposals for change: _ Allow the oversight authority to withhold funds if school officials do n't implement reforms properly _ Give principals more authority over `` remediation programs'' for teachers whose work is judged to be substandard _ Require local school councils to return to the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> any unspent funds at the end of a budget year, rather than carrying the money over into the next budget year _ Remove a requirement that teachers with seniority whose positions are eliminated get first preference for vacancies in other vacant teaching posts When lawmakers convene for their veto session in November, they may accept <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s changes by a majority vote or override him by a three-fifths vote and enact the bill as originally drafted. If they fail to do either, the bill is dead.

 Prosecution witnesses testified today that <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> president said it would cost about $ 10,000 for his efforts in helping secure early release of a convicted killer. A federal court jury of 10 whites and six blacks, including alternate jurors, began hearing testimony today in the extortion trial of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, a Democratic state representative and head of the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, the inmate's father, testified that he took out two loans totaling $ 4,600 and combined it with cash to pay Reed $ 10,000. He said he did so after meeting with <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> about the imprisoned <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON>, who is serving a 40-year sentence for murder in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. `` I explained my son's situation and asked if he could help me. He said he'd helped a lot of them and we'll see,'' <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON>, a partner in the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> business where <PERSON> Woodson </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON> worked, testified that <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> told him he believed he would be able to help the inmate. `` He mentioned that in order to get some help, it would probably cost some money. The figure I remember is $ 10,000,'' said <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, the senior black member of the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, is charged with accepting $ 10,000 in cash and between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 in restaurant equipment from the <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON> family. <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> operates two restaurants in <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubina </PERSON> ruled Monday he would allow into evidence a tape of a conversation between <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, restaurant equipment salesman. In opening arguments Monday, defense attorney <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxley </PERSON> described <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON>'s uncle, as a `` crook to beat all crooks and a con man to beat all con men.'' <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON>, who was convicted in 1980 to a 10-year sentence on a felony theft charge, testified Monday he recorded the conversation with <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> on Aug. 28, 1986, when <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> came to his business. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Special Agent <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, testified that the 27-minute tape was authentic. The tape was not played in court Monday. <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON> wanted back the money allegedly given <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> after the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> and Paroles revoked an order to move up his nephew's consideration for parole, prosecutors have said. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Broward </PERSON> <PERSON> Segrest </PERSON> told the jury that the five-count indictment of <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> described the payments <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON> made to <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> for his `` political influence'' in obtaining the early prison release of <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s attorneys challenged allowing the tape recording into evidence because they said it first went to a state parole board member before it reached the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesser </PERSON> told the judge he gave the tape directly to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. The trial is expected to last three days. `` If the truth prevails, I'll be a free man when I leave here,'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 60, told reporters when he arrived at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in Mobile on Monday. The trial was moved to Mobile from <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> because of publicity surrounding <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s indictment. He also is scheduled to go to trial Nov. 7 in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> on related state bribery charges.

<HEAD>Next Census Facing Hiring Questions, Rising Costs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 1990 Census, with a price tag some estimate as high as $ 3 billion, may have problems hiring enough workers to do the massive national head count, Census Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> census and population subcommittee that he generally is optimistic about plans for the 1990 count. But he expressed concern over hiring 300,000 part-time workers, as well as over the general attitude of the populace toward surveys and censuses. On nights when he ca n't sleep, <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said, `` I wonder if Census can get enough good people to work well enough and long enough in 1990.'' The problems will vary from area to area, and regions with a strong economy and many two-worker families will have few people available to take temporary or part-time jobs at pay ranging from $ 5.50 an hour, he explained. `` One of the bureau's major management challenges ... is acquiring and retaining a sufficient number of competent temporary employees,'' agreed <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodaro </PERSON> of the congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, also appearing before the subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. In 1980 there were times when the bureau could fill only 70 percent of its openings in many areas, <PERSON> Dodaro </PERSON> said, particularly in large cities such as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Thus far, <PERSON> Dodaro </PERSON> noted, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> has been on schedule and under budget in its planning and dress rehearsals for the 1990 count, despite occasional technical problems. <PERSON> Dodaro </PERSON> warned, though, that with inflation the overall cost of the 1990 count could top $ 3 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> has estimated the census will cost about $ 2.6 billion, well over twice the $ 1.1 billion it cost to count the nation in 1980. But <PERSON> Dodaro </PERSON> said he expects the final costs to outrun the planning estimates. In addition to hiring, <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> expressed concern about Americans' attitude toward being counted `` The climate has deteriorated in this nation for taking censuses and surveys. How much it has deteriorated, we do n't know,'' <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said He cited as problems `` junk mail, junk phone calls and sometimes questionable door-to-door businesses.'' For most of the nation, the Census will come in the mail, although Census takers will visit many homes in rural areas where good mailing lists are not available. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering legislation requiring the bureau to adjust its final figures to compensate for people who may be missed in the national head count. The bureau has resisted this in the past, contending that it could not produce accurate estimates of people who are missed and warning that changing the count would damage public confidence in the numbers. Rep. <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., asked how the bureau would respond if the bill passes `` If ordered to do something we would do the best we could under the circumstances. It might not be as good as some would like,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bounpane </PERSON>, who is directing planning for the 1990 count. Asked about a bill to require the bureau to count military personnel overseas for purposes of congressional reapportionment, <PERSON> Bounpane </PERSON> said that poses some problems. Counting those people and asking their home state can be done, he explained, but it is n't always easy to assign military people to a hometown within a state. Thus, a state population total could add up to more than the sum of all the local populations in the state, and that can cause difficulty in drawing congressional district lines within a state, <PERSON> Bounpane </PERSON> said. Counting illegal aliens in the Census has also become a political question, but <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> explained that the bureau must count them. The Constitution and the 1790 Census law require the agency to count everyone residing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he explained, not just citizens.

<TEXT>
 A couple who claim their newborn was swapped for a baby with a heart defect are looking in the wrong place with a lawsuit claiming a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> girl is theirs, a lawyer said. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> claim in a $ 100 million federal lawsuit filed here that their healthy newborn was swapped at <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> birth records show only one other white girl was born at the hospital about the time Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> gave birth in 1978. Based on public records, the Twiggs believe the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> girl, who has not been publicly identified, could be their child. The girl the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON>, now of <LOCATION> Langhorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, took from the hospital was named <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>, and she died Aug. 23 of complications after heart surgery at the <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Heart </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The suit says that while <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> was being prepared for a blood transfusion last May, a doctor at <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> determined that neither of the Twiggs could be her parent. But <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Swope </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> child's father, said he believes the Twiggs are wrong. The girl's father `` sees her mother's look in her face,'' <PERSON> Swope </PERSON> said. The girl's mother died of cancer in 1981. <PERSON> Swope </PERSON> said Monday he will probably advise his client to provide a sample of the girl's blood for genetic testing as a `` courtesy'' to the Twiggs. The blood test, a procedure called HLA testing that compares proteins on white blood cells, is frequently used in paternity disputes and can prove that adults are not the biological parents of a child. It also can offer an extremely high probability that adults are the biological parents of a child. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellin </PERSON>, who represents the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON>, has said that if the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> girl's father refuses requests for testing, he will seek a court order. The Twiggs say they are n't sure if they'll seek custody if the girl proves to be their daughter.

<TEXT>
 The capital's 17,000 taxi drivers began a three-day strike Tuesday to protest anti-pollution measures that restrict cab circulation in the city center. Taxis are included in traffic restrictions banning half the city's 800,000 cars from a five-square-mile zone around the center between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on weekdays, according to odd and even license plate numbers. It was the first strike by taxi drivers since the resrictions were reimposed Sept. 1 after a two-month summer break. `` The anti-pollution measures create tremendous problems for us as we make half our money in the city center. This walkout is just the beginning of more strike action,'' said <PERSON> Kostas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lainis </PERSON>, president of the taxi drivers' union. Taxis were first banned from the center in January when anti-pollution measures were stepped up in an effort to reduce a brown smog cloud that hangs over <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> on warm, still days. Cars, diesel-powered taxis and the city's ageing buses are blamed for spewing most pollutants into the atmosphere.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team flew to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> on Tuesday to search plane crash sites from the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war for clues about missing American soldiers, an official said.

Losses in that area near the Vietnamese border include airmen downed in missions to cut off the Ho Chi Minh Trail, used by communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to infiltrate troops to U.S.-backed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> have conducted three previous joint crash site excavations, most recently in May. The American team in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which brought its own interpreters, are interviewing villagers who witnessed the incidents in which the men were lost and are seeking evidence such as local government reports and human remains. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said the seven are among 70 cases in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says there is strong evidence the men survived and were taken under Vietnamese control. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says it can not prove any Americans are alive in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> but can not ignore that possibility. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> is investigating 119 reports of purported sightings of Americans, <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said. The Americans drove to the Vietnamese villages Monday in jeeps flown in from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> the day before. The search is planned for about 10 days. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said the two sides may later excavate plane crash sites found during the investigation. Previously, the only significant joint field activity was in late 1985, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers and Vietnamese state workers dug up the wreckage of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> B-52 bomber just outside <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. They found remains but none identified as missing Americans. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, leader of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, earlier expressed hope of several joint investigation operations in the coming months. `` We are prepared to provide four teams, if <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> agrees,'' he said. Of the missing, 1,757 are in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, 547 in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, 83 in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and six in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces withdrew from <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> in 1973, after the conflict cost 58,000 American lives.

 Treaties with six countries calling for cooperation in narcotics prosecutions and other criminal matters were approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday after Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> tried and failed to shelve agreements with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. The committee voted 17-2 to recommend the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approve the legal cooperation treaties with those two nations. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, protested that they should not be ratified until the president can certify that no Mexican or <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> officials are involved with narcotics trafficking. Cooperation treaties with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> were approved on a voice vote and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor for action. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> contended that the governments of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> include senior officials who have assisted the drug trade. He said ratification of the treaties would send a signal that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not serious in waging war against narcotics. `` You do n't fight drugs by being partners with the drug traffickers,'' he said. But Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the treaties, negotiated by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, will provide both a potentially important law enforcement tool and a gauge by which to judge whether the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> are living up to their commitments `` If we have this treaty in place we will have a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> relationship that will be almost strictly law enforcement oriented,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. `` There will be an opportunity for creative requests that will let us see if there is cooperation.'' The Mutual Legal Assistance treaties are designed to provide a framework by which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can request the cooperation of the countries involved to obtain evidence to use in criminal prosecutions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Each of the six countries could make similar requests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>EPA Restricts Use Of Tin-Based Marine Paints</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has ordered drastic curtailments of highly toxic tin-based marine paints, banning unsupervised use by pleasure boat owners, the agency said Tuesday. The regulations carry out a new law requiring a five-fold reduction in the release rate of the active ingredient in the paints, tributyl tin or <ORGANIZATION> TBT </ORGANIZATION> compounds, from most hulls. The law bans use of the paints on non-aluminum hulls of vessels of less than 25 meters or 82 feet in deck length, and requires a long-term daily average release rate of 4 micrograms per square centimeter -LRB- about 0.1 thousandths of an ounce per square foot -RRB- or less on other hulls. Existing paints can release <ORGANIZATION> TBT </ORGANIZATION> at about 20 micrograms per square centimeter. The paints may be sold from inventories until Dec. 16 and be used until next June 16. Sold since the 1960s, the nine <ORGANIZATION> TBT </ORGANIZATION> compounds make the paint last much longer than other compounds needed to prevent the growth of barnacles and other organisms on hulls. But their extreme toxicity has led to oyster shell deformities in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that mussels and clams may be killed at concentrations as low as 20 parts per trillion _ a concentration reported for at least 30 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sites, primarily areas with heavy boating activity. As it proposed to do before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stepped in, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said it is restricting sale of the paints to applicators certified under state pesticide programs. Use will be limited to those applicators or people working under the direct personal supervision of certified applicators. Formulators must revise labels to incorporate provisions of the new regulations and instructions for proper disposal. The law gives <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> authority to modify the release rate after it completes its studies, and the agency warned that its action in adopting the congressionally mandated rate in its regulations was not final and could be changed. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said it may have enough data next year to determine acceptable limits to human health of <ORGANIZATION> TBT </ORGANIZATION> ingested in drinking water and fish tissues. Data on additional ecological effects, worker exposure and environmental fate of the compounds are due from manufacturers over the next four years. About 1 million pounds of <ORGANIZATION> TBT </ORGANIZATION> compounds have been used in some 624,000 gallons of paint sold each year, of which about 4 percent has gone to paint docks, buoys and other gear. Copper-based paints, which require painting every year or two instead of the seven-year interval possible with <ORGANIZATION> TBT </ORGANIZATION>, are the chief alternative.

 Former Teamsters President <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was released from prison early today after serving less than 34 months of a 10-year sentence given him for conspiring to bribe a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator. Government officials said they would expect <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> to continue his involvement with the government's war on organized crime as a condition of his release. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoners </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 73, was released at 1 a.m., through prisoners ordinarily are released later in the day. `` He did n't want to be exposed to press coverage and cameras,'' said his lawyer, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 73, suffers from acute emphysema and an enlarged heart. <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON> said he is `` disabled from any work'' and needs an artificial supply of oxygen 24 hours a day. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who has been treated for emphysema and an enlarged heart while serving his term at the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> medical center, would be paroled in recognition of testimony against organized crime figures that `` was at great risk to his personal safety.'' <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON> said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> traveled from <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> to his farm home in <LOCATION> Leeton </LOCATION> in west-central <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. `` He's basically trying to be at home and relax and wake up without bars on the windows and people telling him what to do,'' <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON> said. `` Basically, he's trying to acclimate himself to normal life.'' `` This release is contigent upon his continued cooperation with law enforcement authorities,'' parole commission chairman <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Baer </PERSON> said in a statement Friday. <PERSON> Baer </PERSON> added that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> could be returned to prison if he did not cooperate. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Millin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> attorney who represents <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, has said his client `` will tell the truth if he's asked, as he has done in the past.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was convicted in 1982 of conspiring to bribe a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator for his help in defeating legislation to deregulate trucking. In an 1985 effort to get his prison sentence reduced, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> testified for federal prosecutors that reputed <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> crime boss <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Civella </PERSON> paid him $ 1,500 a month from late 1974 to mid-1981. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he had agreed to help <PERSON> Civella </PERSON>'s organization secure a multimillion-dollar loan from the Teamsters Central States Pension Fund The parole commission's announcement Friday came the day a federal judge had threatened to release <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> if his parole was not re-evaluated. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Collinson </PERSON> had ruled that the parole commission was unconstitutionally trying to block <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' release because of the statements he made about his own links to organized crime, statements that were made after <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was granted immunity from prosecution. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> began serving the sentence Dec. 3, 1985.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Appropriation Bill Despite Objections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today signed a $ 10.5 billion appropriation bill for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and related agencies, but warned that it represents `` congressional overspending'' and runs the risk of across-the-board budget cuts under the deficit-reduction act. The measure appropriates $ 680 million more than the president requested. He said it bings the nation $ 198 million closer to triggering cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law. The measure was the fifth appropriation bill that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has received and signed of the 13 bills <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> annually considers. `` I urge the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to act swiftly to send me the remainder of the fiscal year 1989 appropriations bills _ on time and on budget,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Although he said that `` on balance the act merited my approval,'' the president complained that it once again extended the moratorium on granting oil and gas leases for certain areas of the outer continental shelf. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> increased the damaging effect of the moratorium by extending it to apply to grants of permits for drilling and exploration activities under leases already granted,'' he said. `` For the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to prohibit the issuance of such permits to those who already had obtained leases is unfair.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said that portions of the bill, requiring approval of congressional committees for such things as changes in <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regional boundaries, are unconstitutional.

 A national survey found `` major gains in stature'' for Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the presidential debate, although that poll and three others rated the confrontation a tie overall. None of the surveys found much change in voter preferences as a result of Sunday's debate between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and most found relatively narrow movement in underlying opinions of the candidates. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did better than expected at standing up under pressure and at appearing `` more presidential,'' a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll found, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lost ground in his rating on being able to handle the federal deficit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, improved his ratings in the poll on holding down taxes, controlling crime and maintaining the national defense, and more viewers rated him as likable than had expected to before the debate. The outcome was rated even overall: Thirty-five percent of the 637 voters polled by the newspaper said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the debate, 34 percent picked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 29 percent called it a tie. Similarly, in a Gallup poll for <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> 42 percent said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did the better job and 41 percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did better; in a <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll 44 percent said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won, 36 percent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>; and in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll 42 percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won, 39 percent <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. All the splits were within sampling error. The polls were conducted Sunday night by calling back voters who had been interviewed before the debate and said they intended to watch it. `` It's a wash,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugick </PERSON>, political pollster for the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` What we found is that the debate simply reinforced the image that voters had of these men prior to the debate.'' As in pre-debate polls, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was rated higher on national defense _ 63-31 in the Gallup poll of 337 voters _ while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> scored better on compassion, 51-33. The two were rated even on being able to create needed changes and on having the ideas to foster good economic conditions. Said <PERSON> Hugick </PERSON>: `` These guys are just even on a lot of things that seem to be critical to who's going to win.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s poll, of 639 debate watchers, indicated a possible `` sliver of movement'' toward <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said poll analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. When polled before the debate, the 639 favored <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the election by 48-46; when called back after the debate, they favored <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 52-45. But the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll of 415 debate viewers found the possibility of incremental movement the other way. That group favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 49-44 before the debate and by 52-43 after it. In any case, `` Over 90 percent of each man's supporters stayed with him through the debate,'' said <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. `` And that is the way these things go. Even if it's a knockout, the effect on the horse race is usually marginal.'' On the movement in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' stature, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll found that before the debate respondents were split on who would stand up better under pressure, with 36 percent picking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to 35 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. After the debate, 48 percent said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has stood up better, to 24 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. And voters by 49 percent to 22 percent had expected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be `` more presidential.'' After the debate, the division was narrower: Forty-five percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been more presidential, 29 percent said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The Los Angeles Times' analysis called those results `` major gains in stature'' for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Also, before the debate the newspaper poll found that 36 percent thought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could do better at handling the deficit; after the debate, that fell to 23 percent. Overall, though, the race was a tie: Forty-six percent favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for president, 46 percent <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The horse race results applied just to debate watchers and not to the entire electorate. Also, the polls had relatively small sample sizes, and one-night surveys can be difficult to analyze because they measure visceral reaction to a single event. The margin of sampling error was five points in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> polls, six in Gallup's.

 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> thanked the Japanese people on Tuesday for their outpouring of concern over his fragile health, but doctors expressed no optimism about his condition. Palace officials said physicians have failed to contain Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s internal bleeding, and the government said it has summoned the ailing 87-year-old monarch's grandson home from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>, head of general affairs for the Imperial Palace, quoted chief palace physician <PERSON> Akira </PERSON> <PERSON> Takagi </PERSON> as saying: `` The emperor's condition is stable but it's not improving either. It's an extremely difficult situation. <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said doctors found `` slight traces'' of blood in the emperor's bowel discharge Monday night, an indication of internal hemorrhaging. Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Aya </PERSON>, the 22-year-old younger son of Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, would return to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> shortly from his studies at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Japanese officials have refused to confirm or deny media reports that the world's longest-reigning monarch is dying of cancer. Cabinet members have remained within calling distance and scheduled visits by the prime ministers of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> have been put on hold. More than 30,000 well-wishers called on the Imperial Palace in a chilling rain Tuesday to sign registries wishing for the emperor's recovery, the palace reported Nearly 600, ,000 people had signed their names to registries at the palace and at 11 locations around the country. Elderly Japanese, some wiping away tears, knelt in front of the 285-acre imperial residence in central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to pray for the monarch, who was considered a deity until the end of World War II. Informed of the public response to his illness, the emperor commented today: `` I thank everyone for their concern. Please express my gratitude,'' according to a palace official. `` All we can say is that the emperor has come through one week in stable condition,'' the agency quoted <PERSON> Akira </PERSON> <PERSON> Takagi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s chief physician, as saying <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> received another blood transfusion Tuesday. His slight fever of 98.2 was down from 99 Monday evening but still above his normal level of about 95.9. Although the emperor's body temperature and other vital readings appeared to have stabilized, doctors said they were using antibiotics to control fever and inflammation. News reports said the emperor was also suffering from jaundice and anemia. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has had no food in eight days and aside from two small ice cubes, has been unable to swallow water and is being fed intravenously.

 The scientific adviser to the archbishop of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> said today he was told laboratory tests show the Shroud of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> was made in the 14th century and could not be the burial cloth of Christ. Professor <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> said he has not yet seen the official report from the three laboratories that conducted the carbon-14 dating tests, but that all the leaks to the press dated it to the 14th century and `` somebody let me understand that the rumors were right.'' `` All the leaks were too exact, too concentrated to be a pure invention,'' he said in a telephone interview from the archdiocese in <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>. The shroud, 14 feet, 3 inches long and 3 feet, 7 inches wide, bears the faint, blood-stained image of a whipped and crucified man. Some have maintained the linen is the burial cloth of Christ, while others have dismissed it as a clever forgery. <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> refused to identify who had told him about the shroud but expressed anger the person did not apologize for the leaks to the press. `` It is quite evident somebody sold out to the press,'' said <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> said it was not the church that demanded secrecy and denied they were holding back the results. `` They -LRB- the labs -RRB- asked for the blind test. They said they would make no effort to determine which sample came from the shroud. The raw data was to be sent back to the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> where the key to the code would identify the samples from the shroud. Then they would write up the scientific result,'' he said. `` It is now clear somebody, I do n't know who or how many, made a deliberate effort to determine which sample was the shroud and released it to the press,'' said <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> said the British Museum, as coordinator of the study, had access to the results. It reportedly sent the official results Friday to <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> by special courier. <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> said the official results will be released `` quickly'' after the owner, <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, is informed. However, he said he could not say exactly when the tests would be made public. The laboratories chosen to conduct the carbon-14 tests were <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zurich </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> does not claim the shroud as a holy relic, but instead considered the shroud a `` cherished object'' and treated it with the respect due a holy relic because of the possibility it could be the burial cloth of Christ, <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> also bristled at suggestions in the press that if the shroud was dated to the 14th century it had to be a forgery or a fake. `` It could be a genuine work of Christian art,'' <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> said. `` Just because it is not the burial cloth of Christ does not necessarily mean it is a forgery or a fake, which implies an intent to mislead,'' he said. <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> said tests results dating the shroud to the 14th century would not entirely resolve the centuries-old riddle about the shroud. One of the lasting mysteries is how the shroud was made. <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> pointed to the other scientific studies, such as the 1978 Shroud of Turin Project, which could not determine exactly how the image on the shroud was created. During that study, dozens of American scientists subjected the cloth to chemical and computer analysis and took 30,000 photographs of it. The short recorded history of the shroud has always fueled the debate on its authenticity. French crusader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Clari </PERSON> mentioned seeing the shroud in 1203 in <LOCATION> Constantinople </LOCATION> at the imperial palace, but the first actual records trace it only to <LOCATION> Lirey </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1354. The shroud was bequeathed to the pope by ex-king <PERSON> Umberto </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savoy </ORGANIZATION>, upon his death in 1983.

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> promised college students today that a new Republican administration will give them `` a drug-free and AIDS-free America.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, heading for important campaign appearances in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, appealed to 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> McNeese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students as `` children of the 80s'' for support in the Nov. 8 elections. `` Let me tell you something, children of the 80s, the values of family, future and freedom will never change,'' said the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator, 41, the first baby boomer on a national party ticket. He promised if the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket headed by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is elected, `` we will do all that we must ... to give you a drug-free and AIDS-free America.'' He also promised every effort to provide better health care for Americans as each generation takes care of elderly citizens who are living longer than ever. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I are the leaders of tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` We will lead this country forward into the decade of the 1990s. We will make the future better than the past.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stood at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s side Monday at a <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, rally in his first joint appearance with the vice president since the Republican National Convention in mid-August. He beamed as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had `` not only confidence but pride'' in his embattled running mate. From <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> headed for to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Paso </PERSON> on his first campaign foray into <ORGANIZATION> Lone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, whose senator, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate, will meet <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in a nationally televised debate early next month. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with its 29 electoral votes, is a key battleground in the general election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment in picking <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was questioned by Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in Sunday's debate, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a point during Monday's rally of publicly praising his youthful running mate. The vice president predicted that the public would `` see some more action'' when it tuned in to watch <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s Oct. 5 debate with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator running with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He's going to do just fine,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, at one point giving <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s arm a fatherly pat. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was lavish in his praise for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s debate performance as he addressed the rally of several thousand people at <LOCATION> Casey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jones </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, a railroad theme park. And, he had an answer for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' comments that `` the notion of President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a very, very troubling notion tonight.'' For most people, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` the notion of President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a very, very troubling notion today.'' Despite the scripted rallies, the day was not without its drama. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s plane, a 727 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jet, had to abort its landing just before it was to touch down in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> because the pilot said another aircraft was in the process of landing on a perpendicular runway in front of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s plane. The airfield has no air traffic control operation. The Quayle jet landed uneventfully on its second try, just before <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two arrived carrying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> later, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> toured the <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> Michoud assembly facility, which makes the external fuel tank for the space shuttle, and then spoke to a convention of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>. At the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> plant, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> noted that the countdown had begun for this week's launch of the space shuttle Discovery. He said the shuttle `` must and will remain vital ... and as confidence in the space program is once again restored, through your hard work, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will move on to other steps such as the space station.'' After his <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> swing, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday to begin preparing for the debate with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 41, has said he views the event as an opportunity to give the American public a `` direct and unedited'' look at his qualifications and put to rest doubts they may have because of media coverage of his candidacy and controversies over his military service, academic record and personal life. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has already begun receiving briefings on various issues for the debate, aides said. Over the weekend, he received briefings on economic issues from Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, ranking member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and on labor issues from Labor Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also had a foreign policy session recently with former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>.

 They've never seen <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> but do a fair imitation of moon-walking. For Indian fans of Western rock music, the Beatles are a cult, <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> is still alive, and <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> is scintillating. Almost no major Western rockers have toured <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, but that has n't prevented thousands of Indians from being hooked on their music. The long wait for a top Western pop concert ends Friday when a rock-star-studded entourage including <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, Sting and <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> hits <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> as part of a worldwide <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> tour. `` This is the biggest show to reach <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Anil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>, an organizer of the concert. `` It's the first time music's mega-stars are playing in the region. It will be staged in <LOCATION> Jawaharlal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nehru </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>, with 70,000 tickets on sale. `` I visualize it as more than a sellout,'' said <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>. `` I have gotten inquiries for tickets from as far away as <LOCATION> Trivandrum </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Trivandrum </LOCATION>, on the southern tip of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, is 1,115 miles from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. It is the first large Western music concert in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> since the groups <PERSON> Boney </PERSON> <PERSON> M </PERSON> and <PERSON> Osibisa </PERSON> performed in the early 1980s. But cassettes of Western artists sell by the hundreds every day in the shops of major <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> cities. Letters pour into the Western music section of the government-owned radio station, which runs at least three weekly request programs from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> and other big cities. `` I hear music from every house when I return home at night,'' says <PERSON> Rocque </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>, a drummer and the leader of a band which plays in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> hotels and restaurants. `` It's mostly beat music played on loud stereos. But there's almost no Hindi music to be heard _ maybe because Hindi music nowadays is Western music for 11 bars at a time. Under international copyright laws, any duplication of at least 12 bars of existing music is an infringement. Hindi music is the term used to describe songs in films in the Hindi language. In earlier years, the films were mostly lyrical romances, and their soulful songs helped make a movie popular. But more recent films are more action-oriented, pulsing with a disco Hindi-language soundtrack whose rhythms are usually taken from Western hit tunes. <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>, from the Indian state of <LOCATION> Goa </LOCATION>, a former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony, leads a band which provides a rare opportunity to hear Western music live in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. In live Indian performances, the music imitates the original, but the vocals often have the unmistakable accent of an Indian speaking or singing in English. <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> concedes his trio, which usually consists of a lead guitarist doubling as the vocalist, a bass guitarist and himself on the drums, can not provide the best quality of music. `` Our equipment is n't that good,'' he said. `` It's also difficult for most people to afford the prices our hotels and clubs charge,'' he said. `` Ultimately, most fans have to be satisfied with their stereos. Live music is expensive and even then it's not too good.'' The cassettes sell for about $ 2.15, and pirated versions go for about two-thirds the price. Records are difficult to come by, and compact discs have not yet made an impact in the country. The recent top sellers, according to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> shop owner <PERSON> Ashok </PERSON> <PERSON> Chehal </PERSON>, are <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.

 Attorneys for syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> today argued that errors on a police form make it impossible to prove <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> used an unregistered handgun to wound a teenager intruder. Sgt. <PERSON> Rise </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who works in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> police department's gun control unit, testified that the form _ filled out several days after the June 14 incident to show that <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> had not registered the weapon used in the shooting _ did not specify whether the paper referred to the columnist or his son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Under questioning from <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> also testified that <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s birthdate is listed on the form as Sept. 11, 1925. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s actual birthdate is Aug. 11, 1925. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the columnist's address is listed correctly on the form, but also testified that <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s son, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, had used his father's address when he registered other weapons. A photograph of the person named on the form is another method by which police can identify the individual named on the document, but prosecutor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> did not ask <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> to say whether the columnist's or his son's photograph is attached to the document. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> refused to tell reporters after her testimony which <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s picture was attached to the form. Arguing that the registration form, the police department's formal method for telling prosecutors an unregistered weapon has been used in a crime, fails to link <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> to an unregistered weapon, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, for an immediate judgement of innocence <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> denied that motion. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, an outspoken opponent of handgun use and possession, on June 14 shot a teenager who took a dip in the columnist's pool without permission. If convicted on the charges of unlawful possession of a gun and ammunition, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> would face a maximum penalty of two years in jail and a $ 2,000 fine. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> on Monday selected a panel of 14 jurors, including two alternates, from a pool of 60 prospective jurors. The jurors are eight men and six women. Eleven are black, three are white. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, 63, is black. During the proceedings, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> sat impassively at the defense table, occasionally glancing at family members seated in the courtroom. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said the trial could last as long as a week, but <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> estimated that the matter could be sent to a jury by Wednesday. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> has steadfastly maintained that his son was repeatedly rebuffed by city officials in his efforts to register the weapon used in the shooting. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> had argued that the charges against the columnist should be dismissed on these grounds, but <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> rejected that motion, ruling that the case centered on whether <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> was authorized to use the weapon, not whether it had been properly registered. However, <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> ruled Monday that <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> can enter as evidence his son's account of efforts to register the .22 - caliber weapon, and detailed information about death threats the columnist says prompted him to accept the weapon from his son in early

 A retired <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who helped capture kidnapped newspaper heiress <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> said a new film based on her autobiography inaccurately portrays many events of the saga. `` <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>,'' directed by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrader </PERSON>, details how Ms. <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> was abducted in 1974 by the <ORGANIZATION> Symbionese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, was kept blindfolded in a closet for 57 days and participated in a bank robbery and other crimes. <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>, who claimed she had been brainwashed, spent three years in custody before her sentence was commuted. She is now a housewife. `` I felt the movie was an apology for <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, 68, now retired from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> bureau. `` I've talked to a lot of people who've committed crimes. Everybody has an excuse, but I still believe people have to be responsible for their conscious acts.'' In a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> home, <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said he questioned how Ms. <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> could know how long she was kept blindfolded. He compared her ordeal to prisoners of war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>: `` People were held there for over five years. They were beaten and deprived, and they did n't break and go over to the <LOCATION> Viet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cong </LOCATION>.'' He criticized a film sequence showing uniformed <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> police officers arresting Ms. <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>. He said it was actually plainclothes <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and a police detective who captured her.

 The heavy metal band Iron Cross resorted to some inventive measures to finance their first album, `` Church and State,'' to be released in November. First the band tried to woo investors in a widely publicized plea last year. But backers were apparently more interested in precious metal than heavy metal, and the five raised only $ 1,500 of the $ 15,000 they needed. `` So we had a raffle at the bowling alley,'' band leader leader <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, an assistant manager of a North Side bowling alley, said Monday. `` We took money out of our own pockets. I got married and took half the money we got as gifts to finance the album.'' The five members of the band _ guitarist <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, singer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiegand </PERSON>, bass player <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON>, guitarist <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Syzszko </PERSON> and drummer <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> _ cut the record at <ORGANIZATION> Seagrape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recording </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where their producer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON> is vice president. `` These guys have really shown they're small businessmen as well as good musicians,'' <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Canadians Shamed By Johnson's Loss Of Medal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>

 Canadians were shamed, angry and saddened Tuesday that national hero <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was stripped of his Olympic gold medal for using drugs to enhance his performance. `` I feel terribly sad for him,'' said <PERSON> Fergus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilmartin </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Coquitlam </LOCATION>, British <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. `` I do n't believe he did it on purpose. He has n't got the guile to do that.'' A disappointed nation awaited the return of the sprinter after a urine sample was found to contain traces of anabolic steroids. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s sole gold medal went to American <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who finished second in the 100-meter dash. `` It puts a dent in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, a 10th grade student in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, said Tuesday. Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, who had thanked the Jamaican-born runner for the `` thrill of a lifetime'' after his record-breaking 9.79-second performance Saturday, called the drug scandal `` a moment of great sorrow for all Canadians.'' Sports Minister <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Charest </PERSON>, who called the incident `` a national embarrassment,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> will be banned from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s national team for life <PERSON> Charest </PERSON> said his government accepted the validity of the tests and the suspension would be effective pending an appeal from <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s family was left confused and outraged by the turn of events. `` My brother is not guilty,'' a distaught <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> told reporters in her yard in the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Rexdale </LOCATION>. `` If you could cut him into a million pieces and test him over again _ my brother is not on drugs.'' Outside the townhouse, police were called in to control the crowd and the traffic. Throughout Monday evening, local children attempted to raise a chorus of `` Ben! <PERSON> Ben </PERSON>! <PERSON> Ben </PERSON>!'' only to give up when the crowd would not respond. `` We've just seen the destruction of a role model,'' said former downhill skier <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Read </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, now <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s representative on the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s athletics commission. It was the second shock to national sports fans in recent months. In August, fans were outraged when hockey legend <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gretzky </PERSON>, another national hero, was traded from the <ORGANIZATION> Edmonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oilers </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION>. Some Canadian athletes expressed sympathy for <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokowski </PERSON>, a teammate at the 1984 Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said: `` <PERSON> Ben </PERSON>'s a pretty simple guy. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> does not do drugs. He did not knowingly do this.'' Canadian speedskater <PERSON> Gaetan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> judged the sprinter harshly, saying he has `` no respect'' for an athlete who takes drugs. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> won two gold medals at the 1984 Winter Games in <LOCATION> Sarajevo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Charest </PERSON> acknowledged that it was suggested to him several months ago that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> might be using steroids. `` From time to time people would come to me in a private way _ and this happened one or two times ... that maybe <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is using steroids or other drugs,'' he said. He said the allegations came from no one officially connected with the Olympic team and that he had heard similar, unfounded allegations about other atheletes in the past. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was last tested in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in February at a <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> laboratory. <PERSON> Charest </PERSON> said he did n't press <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> to have a drug test because he thought the sprinter was aware that medal winners at the Olympics would be tested for drugs immediately following competition. `` Everybody knew in advance that Mr. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, if he wins a medal, was going to be tested,'' said <PERSON> Charest </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Reagan Asks Allies to Share in Defense Costs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a farewell meeting with West European and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> figures, said today that free nations must work harder to share the cost of defense. In a meeting with officials of 18 European and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> allies, including <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the president raised anew the question of alliance burden-sharing _ the persistent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plea that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s allies shoulder a larger share of the costs of defending <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In reply, allied leaders underscored the heavy contributions their governments were making to developing countries, and said this should be considered a significant contribution to the joint objectives of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` They spoke in the same general terms as the president, recognizing that everyone must continue to do their share,'' said Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>. She said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who leaves office in about four months, told the allied leaders that `` prosperity and security are inextricably linked.'' Winding up two days of meetings with a wide array of world figures, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also restated American condolences over the death of Pakistani President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ul <PERSON> Haq </PERSON>. But he told reporters that he did not know the circumstances behind <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s death in an airplane crash. `` All I've heard are speculations and so forth,'' the president said during a picture-taking session. `` I have not gotten an official report yet from any of our people.'' On Monday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told leaders of <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> states that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to stop escorting individual ships represents `` just a slight difference'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s waterway policing operation. Posing for pictures with <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Almed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, the emir of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` We're not lessening our protection there at all.'' On a busy day in which the president made his swan-song visit to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also heard an upbeat assessment of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace prospects and voiced new hope that American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> might be set free. But the meetings were dominated by talk of the administration's decision to abandon the policy of escorting U.S-flagged ships traveling the dangerous <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> oil shipping lanes `` We did n't stop. This is just a slight difference,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` It was a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> decision made because of a change in the situation in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the threat to commercial shipping in the area has waned since Aug. 20, when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> began observing a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> acknowledged during a news briefing that the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> leader had told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> he was concerned that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` keep open international shipping channels.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the move from individual ship escorts to a more general <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military surveillance and protection operation represents `` no significant reduction in our force levels and no reduction in our commitment to help defend the freedom of navigation.'' `` There has been no overnight decision to drastically reduce the forces within a set time frame,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. `` The position remains, the forces will go down as the threat goes down.'' During a separate picture-taking session with foreign ministers <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Meguid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seemed to raise new hope for the release of American hostages, although presidential aides insisted there were no new developments to warrant optimism. `` We're encouraged,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said when asked about chances the nine Americans might be released. `` ... But I'm superstitious about calling a no-hitter before the game is over.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters, `` What he said was, ` I do n't want to talk about hostages because it might be bad luck.''' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> got assurances from <PERSON> Meguid </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> was trying to find a way to acknowledge <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. That would meet a primary <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> condition for dealing with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization, which all Arab governments recognize as the sole representative of Palestinians. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told <PERSON> Meguid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal was to move beyond the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty to an overall settlement that takes into account the `` legitimate rights'' of Palestinian Arabs. According to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources who declined to be further identified, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said his government would not deal with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> so long as they are involved in terrorism and violence and speak of trying to force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> back to the partition lines set by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1947.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a tax-free savings account for middle-income Americans today and also said he now thinks he did better in Sunday night's debate than he thought at first. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> as his campaign, pleased with his debate performance, clipped excerpts for TV ads. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in remarks prepared for delivery in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said his proposed account, under which $ 1,000 a year could be invested tax free, would help Americans `` become better able to afford a home, pay for college or start a business'' and would also contribute to national economic strength. Under the plan, the money would have to be invested for at least five years, and only people with adjusted gross income of less than $ 60,000 would be eligible. Taxpayers with adjusted income between $ 50,000 and $ 60,000 would get only a partial deduction. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign estimated the program would cost the treasury $ 70 million in 1989, with the amount increasing to $ 550 million by 1993. On the flight to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also upgraded his assessment of his performance in the debate Sunday night, saying, `` I feel better today about the way the debate went than the night of the debate.'' `` As I think I told you, I felt it was about even, and I now think maybe we did a little better than that in terms of what we needed to do. But I ca n't prove it.'' Earlier today, at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the debate, `` We smoked him out'' and showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to be too liberal for American voters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was campaigning today in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, a crucial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> battleground where 24 <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> votes are at stake. With their general election showdown six weeks away, the two presidential candidates used post-debate, campaign appearances on Monday to clarify statements from their first face-to-face encounter. At a rally Monday in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sought to distance himself from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, charging that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was wrong when he `` suggested that I agree with every position ever taken'' by the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee, however, refused to let the issue rest. `` My values are your values and they are not the values of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a rally and barbecue in <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Aides to the vice president said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would hammer away at the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> issue in the next few days as he attempts to portray the Democratic nominee as a liberal out of the American mainstream. Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was making his first foray into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with stops in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s counterpart, Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, was traveling to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION> On the day after the debate, four nationwide surveys found little change in voter preference and underlying opinions of the two candidates. The polls also showed that most Americans believe <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ended in a tie. A <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> survey, however, found that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made `` major gains in stature'' by appearing more presidential and standing up under the pressure. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign produced two campaign ads showing excerpts from the debate, including the Democratic nominee's summation that, `` The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not behind us. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, rated the debate showdown a draw. `` I kind of thought it was even,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee hours after many of his senior aides termed his performance a success. On Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his staff tackled the issue of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's membership in the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> _ a clear indication of the Democrat's liberal ways, according to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. During Sunday's debate, the vice president referred to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a `` card-carrying member'' of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> and attacked some of the organization's positions. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s efforts to link him to every <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> stand is `` nonsense and he knows it.'' `` Two months ago I signed one of the toughest child pornography laws in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I've always supported tax exemptions for religious institutions, and I certainly do not support <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> who the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> is defending.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his aides tried to prevent the vice president's debate comment that he had n't `` sorted out'' possible criminal penalties against women who obtain abortions from becoming a full-fledged controversy. Campaign manager <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave the issue more thought overnight and decided women are `` additional victims'' and should not be punished for undergoing abortions. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still believes in the possibility of `` punishment as far as the abortionist is concerned,'' if the courts overturn current laws, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters at a rally in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, there was `` no change'' in his stance. At the rally, a joint appearance for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee responded to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' debate comment that `` the notion of President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a very, very troubling notion tonight.'' For many, `` the notion of President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a very, very troubling notion today,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Interior Department Bill, But Calls It Budget-Buster</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed a $ 10.5 billion <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appropriations bill Tuesday, but warned that it runs the risk of triggering across-the-board budget cuts by exceeding the spending level he proposed. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said the bill unfairly restricts offshore oil leasing, but said that `` on balance the act merited my approval.'' It was the fifth appropriations bill he has signed, leaving six to come out of 13 that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> annually considers. `` I urge the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to act swiftly to send me the remainder of the fiscal year 1989 appropriations bill _ on time and on budget,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the opening of the new <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> measure exceeds his request by $ 680 million and brings the federal budget closer to sequestration under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction act. `` This congressional overspending can not continue if the nation is to avoid the uniform, across-the-board cuts that a sequestration inflicts equally on lower priority programs and on the high priority programs upon which many Americans depend,'' he said. Regarding the congressional moratorium on granting oil and gas leases for certain areas of the outer continental shelf, the president said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> increased the damaging effects of the moratorium by extending it to apply to grants of permits for drilling and exploration activities under leases already granted.'' `` For the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to prohibit the issuance of such permits to those who already had obtained leases is unfair,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president also said many provisions of the bill `` reflect a growing and disturbing trend on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to include unconstitutional committee approval or veto requirements in appropriations bills.'' He said the measure would require, for instance, the approval of congressional committees to change <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regional boundaries, to close <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regional offices or to reduce personnel in the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` In granting authority or making appropriations by law, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may not reserve to its committees approval or veto power over the exercise of that authority or the expenditure of those appropriations,'' the president said. Since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` has indicated such a special interest'' in these matters, he said, the administration will consult the lawmakers about them.

 A six-story apartment house collapsed today and slid down a steep mountainside in a wealthy district of this northern industrial city. Officials said at least two people were killed and others were trapped in the debris. At least two people survived the collapse, but both were injured. The number of people trapped was not known. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakashima </PERSON>, an investigator with the state judicial police, said the 3-year-old cement building collapsed shortly before 9 a.m. `` One of the neighbors told us that six months ago they told the architect that the building was loosening and and it was leaning,'' he said. Asked if the severe rains brought by <PERSON> Hurricane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> 11 days ago could have caused the collapse, he said: `` It had to have something to do with it.'' The bodies of a man and a boy were removed from the collapsed building, <PERSON> Nakashima </PERSON> said. The building, which had one apartment to a floor, collapsed like a pancake into a pile about one story high, and part of it slid about 30 feet down the mountain. Mattresses, clothing and furniture were strewn over the area. Perched high in the wealthy district of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garcia </LOCATION>, it was one of the highest buildings in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 27, was sleeping in his second floor apartment when the building collapsed. `` I woke up and the roof was on top of me,'' he said. He said his maid apparently was trapped inside the builidng. His face and pink T-shirt were covered with blood and his chin covered with white gauze bandage. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Junco </PERSON> said his 19-month-old granddaughter, <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Junco </PERSON>, and a maid were inside his son's third floor apartment at the time of the collapse. They have not been found, he said. A block down the street, the girl's weeping mother was attended by neighbors. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Loredo </PERSON>, an ambulance driver, said he took two bodies from the scene and transported a survivor, a man about 25 years old, to <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. The man appeared to have broken ribs, he said. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> caused heavy flooding in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>. At least 140 people, most of them passengers on buses, were swept away when water rushed through the normally dry bed of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catarina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s third largest city, with 2 million residents, and the capital of the state of <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Former Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> says both Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did well in Sunday night's debate, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s success came `` probably because I taught him how to do it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, who debated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during the 1984 campaign, also said her unsuccessful campaign would continue to be significant until a woman is elected to the White House. `` I have a place in history,'' she said Monday night before a speech at <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` And I'll have that place in history until a woman runs and wins. Then I'll fade into the woodwork.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congresswoman, was the running mate chosen by Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, making her the only woman ever nominated for president or vice president by a major political party. The 1984 Democratic ticket suffered one of the worst defeats ever in a presidential race.

<HEAD>Battle Of Symbols Waged In Korea's Demilitarized Zone</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With the fighting fast and furious on the Olympic fields, the rice paddies of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> seem eerily calm. On this no-man's land in limbo between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, just an hour's ride from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, the battle being waged is one of symbols. The only clear signs of the momentous sports gathering 30 miles away is an Olympic flag taunting <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the signature of Olympic swimming star <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Biondi </PERSON> in the visitors' book at Camp Bonifas, the forward <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> command at the Demilitarized Zone. More than halfway through the Olympics, fears of an attack by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> against the Games have receded. In fact, the communist <PERSON> North </PERSON>, which had sought to co-host the games with its archrival, appears to be studiously ignoring the international sports meet. `` They have n't even attacked the Games in their propaganda,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffard </PERSON>, who serves with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> command. <PERSON> Griffard </PERSON> is one of 375 people stationed at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bonifas </LOCATION>, adjacent to the site of Quonset huts where regular meetings are held with the North to discuss violations of the 1953 armistice agreement that ended the three-year Korean War. Since the Olympics began, most of the commentary from the North's loudspeakers focuses on the disappointment of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> students that the Games were not being held jointly in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, he said. Radical South Korean students, seeking unification with the North, staged violent protests against the Olympics in the months leading up to the Games, but their demonstrations have declined since the competitions began last week. The men of Camp Bonifas, about half of whom are <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>, have also noticed that the North is cranking up its loudspeaker music a little more for the constant stream of tourists visiting the DMZ. The blasts of music _ a mixture of oriental and Western tunes _ are sometimes accompanied by praise for ruler <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> and exhortations to South Koreans to defect. But the South's propaganda machine is just as persistent as the North's. The South Koreans are encouraging visitors and reporters to take the opportunity to tour <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, making this the hottest attraction after the Games. As many as 18 tour buses a day cross the narrow wood-planked Freedom Bridge spanning the mine-strewn <LOCATION> Imjin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and leading to the DMZ. Tours offered to reporters and photographers covering the Olympics are booked days in advance. The visit begins with a 25-minute slide presentation, accompanied by a profusion of facts and figures about the <ORGANIZATION> DMZ </ORGANIZATION> rattled off by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officer: Symbols abound. The Americans call the mostly uninhabited <PERSON> Gijung </PERSON> <PERSON> Dong </PERSON> `` propaganda village.'' The pagoda-like building which serves as headquarters for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> armistice officers is known as <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Less than 100 yards away, North Korean soldiers snap photos of the visiting reporters and peer at them through binoculars. `` Do n't make any gestures to them,'' the media group is warned Visitors must be dressed properly _ no jeans, shorts or sneakers: `` We do n't want them to think we're decadent,'' says Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Feliu </PERSON>, accompanying the group. The troops who patrol the zone must be over 6 feet tall and over 180 pounds in weight. The North Koreans tend to be shorter. `` The purpose is intimidation, pure intimidation,'' says <PERSON> Feliu </PERSON>. In the battle of North-South oneupmanship, as on the Olympic fields, every inch counts. So when the North raised its flag pole to 330 feet, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> followed suit, although the North has since upped it to 528 feet, and the South has yet to match it. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s headquarters building in the Joint Security Area, where the armistice talks are held, is about a yard higher and longer than the adjacent <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, says Cpl. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkinson </PERSON>, another military explainer. `` But it's much narrower than ours,'' <PERSON> Adkinson </PERSON> adds with satisfaction. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and South Korean troops at the <ORGANIZATION> DMZ </ORGANIZATION> are ever at the ready. Nothing special for the Olympics, says <PERSON> Adkinson </PERSON>. So on an autumn day in <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, the men feel as bored as ever. The only highlight of their day is the Olympic competition being beamed to them from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, one hour and a world away.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> predicts the two House committees that have been asked to investigate his disclosure of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> efforts to provoke the Nicaraguan government will drop the complaints. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, speaking to a small group of reporters on Monday, said he expects the Intelligence and ethics committees to agree with his contention that legislators have the right to comment on executive branch covert activities. `` They'll dismiss it,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> complaint to the committees. `` Surely it has no merit. It has no merit at all.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, also repeated his assertion that he did not reveal any classified information. `` I ca n't conceive of any committee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> taking the position that the speaker is inhibited from expressing his convictions on something that is in the public domain,'' he said. `` I have not only the right but the responsibility to express my views.'' He added: `` I would just like to be credited with at least telling the truth.'' But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> again declined to say specifically where he got his information on the covert <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> activity that he disclosed a week ago. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s disclosure of what he termed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempts to provoke overreaction by the Sandinista government prompted formal calls from Republicans for an investigation. Asked whether he had been briefed on the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by the No. 2 official in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said `` I do n't have any recollection of his briefing me,'' and referred further questions to <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> today declined to say what he had told <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on the subject, saying his conversations with the speaker were private. A <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> spokesman said yesterday that his boss hado member. `` I'm not going to discuss my private conversations with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` The fact that a matter is classified, secret, does n't mean it's sacrosanct and immune from criticism,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. He cited as examples the mining of Nicaraguan harbors by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 and the agency's efforts to overthrow <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> in the 1970s, both of which eventually leaked out. It is against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules to disclose classified information conveyed to the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Suspected violations of the rule must be investigated by the ethics committee, known formally as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. The committee met for two hours on Friday and adjourned without deciding how to proceed on the investigation request, filed by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., and Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> The panel's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., said he was conferring with <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Rep. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, about how to proceed The controversy began Sept. 20 when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters there had been `` clear testimony'' from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> about agency efforts to stir up civil unrest in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in hopes of provoking a <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> overreaction that would dash peace talks. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said then that the information had been provided by the spy agency under congressional questioning. Since the disclosure provoked an outcry from Republicans and intelligence officials, the Democratic leadership has been scrambling to shift the focus to the question of whether the administration action was proper at a time when it was voicing public support for the peace talks.

 Some may swoon, but others demand, `` Can he type?'' <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is making an impression on women but it's not always the one Republican strategists may have had in mind. When <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> catapulted to prominence as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, it was hard to ignore two facts: Other Republicans were far more experienced, and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, blond and fresh-faced, possessed striking good looks. `` I ca n't believe a guy that handsome would n't be attractive in some respect'' to women, said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., at the GOP convention in August `` Anyone that good-looking must stand for really good things,'' said a supposedly surveyed woman in a recent Doonesbury comic strip. `` I think most women want a really hot guy to be in charge of the country,'' agreed her friend. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> was n't kidding. But the mock Doonesbury poll should have been `` adjusted for sarcasm,'' according to the strip. Experts disagree on whether <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will help attract women to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket headed by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He's been credited with narrowing the gender gap, but he's also been compared to a `` Ken'' doll _ `` Barbie'' doll's friend _ and labeled a hindrance rather than a help for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. When actor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> escorted <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to the podium at the convention, `` I saw grown women faint and moan,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>. `` There are a lot of women where -LRB- physical appearance -RRB- still is important. ... I do n't think <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has the charisma of <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>. But that still has some impact.'' <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a Democratic consultant and Ms. Magazine columnist, sniffed at the thought. `` Candidates that would pass a Hollywood screen test do not do noticeably better than candidates that would flunk it. Looking at the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> will bear this out,'' she said. On the other hand, former actor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has had some political success. Recent polls showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had erased a 20-point gender gap and was winning as much support from women as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic nominee. Democrats say <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had nothing to do with this development. But <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been the only variable in the race since the conventions; thus `` you could hardly make the case that he's not a factor.'' At rallies across the country, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has encountered a mixed reception. Some placards carry messages such as `` But Can He Type?'' and `` Women Do n't Vote For Men Prettier Than They Are.'' But many women eagerly press forward to hear and touch him. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> predicted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would attract women who would have voted for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket anyway. `` He may cause some excitement at parties and gatherings, but he does n't cause vote-switching among undecided or independent women voters,'' she said. `` Right now he is the biggest single danger to eorge <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s election. He is a land mine that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planted in his own territory.'' Republicans claim <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has more than sex appeal to offer women voters, and hold up his marriage as exhibit <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, is a lawyer taking off more than a decade to raise the couple's three children. `` A lot of women in that age group of his wife, professional women staying home to raise the children, can relate to that family,'' said <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON>. `` They feel that he understands working wives, women as professionals.'' <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is `` the epitome of the modern woman,'' said Stone. `` That says a lot about him, that he has a partner that strong.'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said, `` If I were a partisan Republican desperately looking for something good to think or say about <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would be the best example I could think of.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> herself blamed the pretty-face controversy on the news media and recently declared, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would n't have selected someone who could not stand in his stead for president.'' But Democrats beg to differ. `` He just goes to prove that the word airhead is not sexist,'' said Democratic media consultant <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Squier </PERSON>. `` It's like <PERSON> Dorian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> for vice president. There's this pretty face out there campaigning, but someplace up in an attic somewhere is a portrait of this guy which is painted by his record.'' Some women have reacted with outrage to the notion that they would vote for a candidate because he's cute. And despite heated denials that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was chosen for that reason, some Democrats see the possibility of a backlash against him. `` Women will look at this thing as an appalling, cynical, sexist decision,'' said <PERSON> Squier </PERSON>. `` In the end, his negative rating will be higher among women than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s.'' `` What is off-putting is that everything in his life has been so easy for him,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. If <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> were less handsome, she said, `` at least it would have been one thing in life he had to overcome.'' Well, maybe there is something <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has had to overcome: his good looks. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciccone </PERSON>, an issues strategist for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, says the senator `` fights the pretty face thing almost like a woman does. There's a predisposition to think he does n't have a brain. He's really very intelligent and that's going to come out in the course of the campaign.''

<HEAD>Japan To Kill Hundreds Of Whales</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> plans to kill about 300 whales this winter in a research project aimed at proving there are enough of the mammals to resume commercial hunting, government officials said Tuesday. A similar plan last year was sharply criticized by international environmental groups, which accused <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of conducting the experiment to circumvent an international ban on commerical whaling. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> recently submitted the whaling plan to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for review, but decided not to publicize its contents until the evaluation was complete. They said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> planned to catch `` very close'' to 300 minke whales in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> this winter. The species is estimated by the commission to number more than 430,000 worldwide. The Japanese government says research whaling is necessary to assess whale stocks, and such factors as age, sex and health. Japanese officials say they hope the research will prove there are adequate numbers of some whale species, such as the minke, to allow a resumption of limited commercial whaling. Last year, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> told the commission it would kill 875 minke and sperm whales for research purposes, but strong opposition from international environmental groups and other commission members reduced the catch to 273 minke whales, according to officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The officials said this year's research methods will be similar to those practiced last year, when ships sailed along a fixed route and killed only one or two whales in each group sighted. In 1982, the commission passed an international ban on commercial whaling to allow scientists to study whale populations without hunting pressure. The ban went into effect in 1986 and is to be re-evaluated in 1990 on the basis of the research results. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> officially ended its commercial whaling in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> at the end of the 1986-87 season, when it caught 1,941 of the mammals. The commission's charter allows member nations to conduct research whaling without approval from the 42-member body. Environmentalists have charged that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ where whale meat has long been an important protein source _ is using the research provision to maintain its whaling industry. Japanese officials say other commission members have not been serious about conducting research during the moratorium and plan merely to renew the ban in 1990. `` In the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>, only <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is conducting research,'' one official said, speaking anonymously. `` The people who are criticizing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are not presenting any data of their own.''

 Journalists are flocking here at record rates to cover the launch of the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manned spaceflight since the Challenger disaster shook certainty about the space program's safety. At least 5,000 journalists had asked for credentials by Tuesday to cover the Discovery mission, scheduled for liftoff Thursday morning. `` Everybody thought shuttle flights were routine. Challenger proved it's a risky business,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotz </PERSON>, former editor of <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> magazine and a member of the presidential commission that investigated the Challenger explosion 32 months ago. All four national television networks will cover the launch live this time. Only <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> had live coverage when the Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff, claiming the seven astronauts' lives. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannifin </PERSON>, a Time magazine correspondent who has covered every manned space mission, recalled one colleague's decision several years ago to stop covering launches routinely. `` To his embarrassment now, he said the shuttle was just like a 747 taking off. `` But we're not sitting here on a body watch,'' <PERSON> Hannifin </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> return to manned spaceflight is the biggest story of this decade and it's our mission to inform our readers.'' `` It's frightening because we do n't know if everything will be OK,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, reporter for <ORGANIZATION> France-Soir </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. `` But it is also exhilarating.'' She was among the large foreign press contingent, including representatives from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and more than a dozen other nations that have been accredited. Two Soviet journalists asked for credentials, then canceled. `` Public interest in the space program has continued to grow,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the busy press center. `` There's a zoo out there,'' he added. Young and other <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials were also dealing with news representatives upset about unprecedented plans to restrict the number of journalists covering the launch at the press center, about four miles from the launchpad. The restrictions follow <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> recommendations that cited safety concerns. Discovery accreditation requests are the most ever received for a space mission. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in the past, about 70 percent of those accredited have shown up. The previous record for journalists was 2,700 at the first shuttle launch and about the same number at the Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 moon missions. There were 1,467 for Challenger. `` This is a significant piece of American history,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, a CBS News special events producer coordinating the network's 100-person operation here. `` This is not a packaged story like the national conventions, where the outcome is known.'' CBS coverage will include Wednesday and Thursday `` Evening News'' broadcasts from the cape with anchor <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> and live coverage of the launch. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, with anchor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, with <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, also will carry live coverage of the launch and anchor their news shows from the space center. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> will have anchor <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> leading its live coverage. The networks were working out of new, larger buildings constructed since the Challenger launch. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> accredits virtually anyone who is a legitimate journalist. College journalists are accredited, although the space administration draws the line at high school reporters. Only 1,800 of the journalists will be permitted at the press center, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has set up a second press area 7.5 miles from the launchpad for the remainder. The restrictions resulted from an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> study spurred by the Challenger accident and the subsequent explosion of a Titan rocket launched from Kennedy Space Center. The study calls the press center hazardous because of the possibility of debris from an explosion falling near the launch site. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the 1,800 figure would permit all news media under deadline pressure adequate coverage. But some veteran space reporters were angered by the restriction. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., who flew on a shuttle mission, also protested `` We do not feel <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is in the position to tell us how many people we need to cover a story. On principle, we will never buy that,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolcum </PERSON>, a senior editor for Aviation Week.

<TEXT>
 Some Burmese fleeing to frontier areas claimed Tuesday they saw troops execute anti-government protesters, and a newly formed opposition group accused the military government of torture. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> say there are increasing reports of executions of lower-level, anti-government leaders but they have yet to be confirmed. The opposition League for Democracy league issued the torture charge in a statement Tuesday, which said: `` It -LRB- the league -RRB- condemns and demands immediate ending of irresponsible and illegal acts of arrests, torture and killings in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and other towns.'' The statement provided no other details. The coalition also named retired army officer <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> as its chairman, former defense minister <PERSON> Tin </PERSON> <PERSON> Oo </PERSON> as vice chairman and <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, daughter of slain independence leader <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, as general secretary and spokeswoman. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> immediately called for an interim government to replace the military government of Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, which took power in a Sept. 18 coup and cracked down on nationwide street demonstrations. The government announced Tuesday that 348 persons had been killed nationwide, 219 others wounded and 1,107 arrested since Sept. 18. But the government has not mentioned actual executions of detainees. The government previously acknowledged more than 250 deaths but has not mentioned executions. Western diplomats believe troops killed up to 400 civilians in the first few days after the coup. In Ghay Baw Bo near the <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> border, some Burmese said the executions took place as people protesting 26 years of authoritarian rule fled to areas of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> controlled by <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> guerrillas. Soe Hlaing, a 36-year-old lawyer from <LOCATION> Pegu </LOCATION>, said he saw nine people executed by soldiers on a bridge in the town of <LOCATION> Tharrawdy </LOCATION> during his flight. `` Each was shot with a gun. One bullet to the heart,'' Soe Hlaing said. A student from the <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> said he witnessed the `` sysematic killing'' of 10 people in <LOCATION> Mudon </LOCATION>, south of the coastal city of <LOCATION> Moulmein </LOCATION>. He spoke on condition of anonymity. Most of the alleged killings occurred after <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> sent troops into the streets of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and other cities to put down massive anti-government demonstrations. The League for Democracy, formed Saturday, united <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s traditionally fragmented opposition to revitalize the anti-government movement after the military crackdown A league official announced the leadership appointments.

Although the government claims some workers are back on the job, business remains crippled.

 Hog producers and importers have voted overwhelmingly to continue mandatory assessments to promote pork and help boost the image of the swine industry, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON> said 33,534 or 77 percent of the 43,532 valid ballots cast were in favor of the checkoff plan. Only a simple majority was needed for approval. The department conducted the referendum Sept. 7-8 at county offices. <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON> said that since a majority supported the program, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which administers the program, will continue to collect the assessments of one quarter of 1 percent of the market value of all hogs and pigs sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and an equivalent amount on `` all imported porcine animals, pork and pork products.'' The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> issued its order setting up the program on Sept. 5, 1986, and assessments began on Nov. 1, 1986. But the 1985 law authorizing the program specified a referendum on the checkoff within 24 months to 30 months. Voting by state, as reported by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, is shown here, with the vote for the checkoff program in the first column and the vote against it in the second:

 A comatose police academy cadet, one of 16 overcome last week by strenuous training, underwent a liver transplant today, but officials said an investigation showed no evidence that he or others had been abused at the academy. At a news conference, the officials said the training was routine for the first day at the academy, including repeated heavy exercise. Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>, the chief state epidemiologist, had said earlier that his preliminary examination last week found `` it's very clear the exercise was stressful. But he said today that further investigation found `` at this time that the cause of the illness was a relatively insufficient intake of water relative to the amount of exercise they were doing.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` There was strenuous physical activities, as there always was on that first day ... -LRB- but -RRB- we have found no one that was denied water upon request.'' Asked if his conclusion was that it was the fault of individual cadets that they took ill, <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> said, `` Some of them were unware of the fact that they were doing damage to themselves.'' Earlier, some cadets had said they had been given only a small amount of water the day the cadets had taken ill. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION>, who has been in a weeklong coma, entered surgery Monday night for a liver transplant at <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s Presbyterian Hospital <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberts </PERSON>, hospital nursing administrator, would say only that <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s condition was critical this morning. <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Everest </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojtkowski </PERSON>, who is acting as a spokeswoman for the <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> family, said said the surgery was completed at 5:30 a.m. today and the family was told that <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> came through the operation `` very well.'' <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> was the most seriously ailing cadet after last week's series of illnesses swept the <ORGANIZATION> Edward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION> just south of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> Several former cadets have suffered similar fatigue-related medical problems at the academy over the past four years, according to former cadets and an <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> physician. Dr. <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Lentz </PERSON> said she treated between three and eight police recruits from <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION> in 1984 after they were overcome on the first day of training at the academy. Among the 16 cadets who were hospitalized beginning Sept. 19, the first day of classes, ailments ranged from dark urine to exhaustion and dehydration. Although several stricken cadets refused to be interviewed Monday without clearance from superiors, one former trainee said the training routine was severe. `` I've been through basic training in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and it was twice as bad as that,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON>, who quit the academy after one day. `` The doctors told me that if I had gone back for a second day, I could have suffered permanent kidney damage.'' After <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> collapsed while running Sept. 19, instructors allowed the recruits to drink two small cups of water, <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON> said. `` Before that, they had lined us up at the bubbler twice during the day and only let us take one cup of water each.'' Six recruits remained hospitalized Monday. Several local officials, including <LOCATION> Wojkowski </LOCATION> and <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, asked the state attorney general's office to review the training program. <PERSON> Wojkowski </PERSON> met Monday with <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> and state police Capt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of the Agawam academy. `` I was completely dissatisfied with their responses,'' <PERSON> Wojkowcki </PERSON> said. `` I suspect that the incidents are not isolated.'' <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> was in top shape and had worked out more than six months preparing for the academy, said his brother, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` He really wanted to be a policeman,'' the brother said. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state office of public safety, said <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s condition may have resulted in part from a `` self-induced, severe diet.'' But <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> said his brother spent the days before reporting to the academy with his family and ate normally.

<HEAD>Carter Center Helps Distribute Pill That Prevents River Blindness</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A pill that prevents heartworms in <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s bird dogs also halts a parasite that blinds thousands of Third World residents, and the former president is helping to make sure that it reaches them The Task Force for Child Survival, a public health foundation based at the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, is overseeing a worldwide system to get the drug Mectizan to the 85 million people at risk for the tropical disease. Mectizan is the commercial name for invermectin, used by veterinarians to treat heartworms in dogs and other parasites in cattle and swine. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> discussed his organization's role in the program in a recent telephone interview from his home in Plains. `` I've got two bird dogs and one of my constant problems is that my dogs get heartworms,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` When a mosquito bites a dog, a little microorganism goes through the body and winds up in the dog's heart and causes heartworms. `` Mectizan is very effective against heartworm not only with dogs but with other animals. And it also proves to be effective against river blindness because river blindness is caused by the sting of a little fly that grows in very rapidly flowing streams,'' said the former president. River blindness, formally known as onchnocerciasis, is caused by a parasitic worm spread by the fly. It has infected 27.5 million people in more than 30 countries, mostly in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>; 350,000 have been blinded. One dose of Mectizan kills the adult worm's millions of tiny offspring and prevents the adult from reproducing for a year. It is the worm's offspring, called microfilaria, that cause the symptoms of the disease, including skin lesions, severe itching and the blinding eye lesions. The medicine halts the progress of the disease but does not reverse damage already caused by microfilaria. A person bitten by the fly who takes Mectizan once a year for the eight-to-12-year life cycle of the adult worm will be free of the disease unless he is reinfected by another fly bite. Mectizan, derived from acids produced by a bacterium found in Japanese soil, is manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The <LOCATION> Rahway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, pharmaceutical company began developing the drug for humans in 1980. Another heartworm medicine for dogs, diethylcarbamazine, has been found effective in fighting a parasitic disease called loiasis, prevalent in western and central <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The disease is caused by the loa loa, or African eyeworm, and it is spread by biting flies that feed on human blood. The disease can cause heart and kidney damage. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has been fighting river blindness for years. WHO and <PERSON> Merck </PERSON> spent seven years on research trials before Mectizan was approved for human use by French drug officials last year, clearing the way for worldwide distribution. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Merck </PERSON> has volunteered to make the drug available worldwide and free of charge. The company said last year that building a distribution network was its only remaining roadblock. That's where <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s organization comes in. <PERSON> Merck </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION> said they wanted an independent committee of experts to review the organizations set up to distribute the drug, to monitor any adverse reactions and to keep records on the permanent distribution program. The Mectizan Expert Committee is chaired by Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foege </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and a former director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, who was instrumental in organizing the worldwide smallpox eradication program. Next month the committee will begin reviewing the first applications for the program, clearing the way for <PERSON> Merck </PERSON> to start shipping the medicine to high-risk areas.

<HEAD>Failure Rate Has Hospitals Scrambling For Replacements</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The failure rate on the national nursing exam given in July went up across the country, and in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> that exacerbated a nursing shortage in hospitals, nursing homes and other health-care facilities. Nursing-school graduates can work as registered nurses until their test results arrive but those who fail lost their positions, and that has left the industry scrambling to find replacements. `` It's terrible timing,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION>, who worries that the bad results also will scare young people away from a nursing career. Nationally, 16.4 percent of people who took the two-day exam for the first time in July failed, said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Yocom </PERSON>, director of research services for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION>, which prepares the exam. That is the highest failure rate since the council started the exam in 1982. Last year, just 9 percent of first-time test takers failed, and in previous years the failure rate ranged from 8 percent to 12 percent, <PERSON> Yocom </PERSON> said. The failure rate increased in all 50 states, she said. The failure rate in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> was about 20 percent, up from 10 percent in July 1987 and 8 percent to 12 percent in previous years, said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Calico </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON>, vice president for member services of the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said a survey the association did in 1987 found that one in 10 registered-nurse positions in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> hospitals was unfilled. `` We're in a real bind,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Massie </PERSON>, chief operating officer of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> Medical Center. The <ORGANIZATION> UK </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> already had closed three intensive-care-unit beds because it did n't have enough nurses, <PERSON> Massie </PERSON> said. Changes in the test partly help explain the higher failure rate. This year's test covered new subjects to reflect the changing skills and knowledge required of entry-level nurses, <PERSON> Yocom </PERSON> said. Also, the number of correct answers needed to pass was increased, but by fewer than 10 out of the total of 300 questions asked, she said. The council wo n't reveal how many correct answers are needed to pass the test. <PERSON> Yocom </PERSON> said the council expected the failure rate to increase but not by as much as it did. She said changes in the exam accounted for only half the increase. She theorized that increasing opportunities for women in other professions, night and weekend hours in many health-care settings, and non-competitive salaries have prompted fewer top-quality people to enter nursing. The <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> has asked the national council to offer the exam three times a year instead of twice so nurses can get into the work force more quickly. The next scheduled exam is in February, and by the time those results come out, nurses who failed in July but pass in February would not be able to start work until about April.

 Hotel rooms are overflowing, motor homes are jamming the roadways and business people are laughing all the way to the bank as they hope to welcome up to 1 million visitors for Discovery's launch on Thursday. `` We're looking at megabucks,'' exulted <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Catrambone </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Titusville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> bows were on virtually everyone's dress or lapel, in keeping with the Space Coast's `` Green for Shuttle Go'' tourist slogan. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> is appropriate, too, because of the many greenbacks expected to be rung up on cash registers all over <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` My business had increased 10 times over the last few months,'' said <PERSON> Mada </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, owner of a souvenir shop in <LOCATION> Cocoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Police, county and local officials anticipate one of the biggest launch crowds since the Apollo moon missions and the first shuttle launch in 1981. Some visitor estimates are upwards of 1 million. While business owners and tourism executives beat the drums welcoming visitors, others are bracing for a traffic nightmare and rushing to set up medical aid stations, portable toilets and temporary food stands. `` Can you imagine about a million people wanting to go to the bathroom at about the same time?'' joked <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> McMullen </PERSON>, director of the county's <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which prefers the tag `` Space Coast,'' has only 8,300 hotel-motel rooms and some 4,000 campsites, and they were all reported full on Tuesday. Among those not having to sweat and jostle for viewing spaces along the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> banks, at Jetty Point Park or on the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> causeway will be more than 2,000 special <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> guests who will be ushered to a site on the Space Center grounds. These include at least 50 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a Saudi Arabian prince, actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Travolta </PERSON>, actress <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>, a couple of Cabinet members and former astronauts. The VIPs `` have shown an interest in <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, and they may `` convey the experience to other people,'' said space agency spokesman <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Varnes </PERSON>. Adding to the throng of big-spending tourists is a record crowd of journalists, many of whom came early and plan to stay late. More than 5,000 requests for credentials were received by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, said space agency spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, and of that about 70 percent were expected to be here. `` The media are spending money everywhere,'' said <PERSON> McMullen </PERSON>. It's just like old times for some veteran bartenders, said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolsch </PERSON>, operator of Rainbows bar and restaurant in <LOCATION> Cocoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, which is doing a heavy business in a concoction named `` Shuttle Shooters.'' The red, white and blue combination of grenadine, cocoa creme and a mint-flavored blue liqueur is so popular that he's thinking of putting on extra help just to keep up with the demand. `` It's really a big challenge and damn hard work dealing with the big numbers,'' said <PERSON> Catrambone </PERSON>. `` But we'll take it in stride, just like we always do.'' He expects some quarter-million visitors in the immediate area around <LOCATION> Titusville </LOCATION>, a town of about 43,000. Police Chief <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> expects 100,000 of them to line the banks of the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which is directly across from the launchpad, about 12 miles away. On Tuesday, cars, motor homes and recreational vehicles were already pulling in to stake out claims for good viewing spots. In all the hoopla, many residents along the Space Coast were not forgetting the horror of the last launch. At a special Mass last week, some 250 elementary schoolchildren prayed for a safe mission for Discovery and its five astronauts. Several of the youngsters remembered seeing the Challenger explosion through their school windows on Jan. 28, 1986. But most were optimistic, reflecting the generally prevailing mood. `` They've had time to fix all those things that were wrong. I'm excited,'' said 9-year-old <PERSON> Jenna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>

 A couple that cared for 11 foster children and lost their house in a fire hope to move this weekend into a new house built with donations from people touched by the family's plight. `` I want to thank everybody who gave,'' said <PERSON> Verba </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON>, who with her husband <PERSON> William </PERSON> have cared for more than 100 foster children over nearly four decades. `` We've had some wonderful response from people all over the country.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON>, the 65-year-old pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Mecis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of God, and her husband, a retired coal miner in his 70s, were caring for 11 foster children when the fire destroyed their home July 28. All the children escaped harm but the family lost everything else. Mrs. <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> said she did not have time to even retrieve her purse. They were forced to move in with a relative of hers. Neighbors organized immediately to build the <ORGANIZATION> Mayos </ORGANIZATION> another, bigger house on the lot behind the old one. The new structure is worth $ 40,000 but built with only $ 15,000 because so much of the labor and material was donated. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, one of the volunteers who helped direct the building of the new house, said Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> Mayos </ORGANIZATION> hope to move in Friday or Saturday. However, he said the appliances that were donated to the home were `` just junk'' and that efforts were being made to get nicer appliances and furnishings. `` They've got very little furniture other than almost junk,'' he said. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said he was going to <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> to seek appliances and furniture donations and that a church in <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was expected to assist with furnishings, but he had no specifics. `` She has taken care of lots of people over the years, including a lot of elderly ... people. And when the kids she kept get too old for welfare, she sends them on to college if they will go,'' said <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, who broke an arm in a fall while putting up sheet rock in the house. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who directed the project with <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, called Mrs. <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> a unique person. `` She gives those kids more than just a place to stay. She really loves those kids and they love her,'' he said. `` When their house burned down, I just felt like the Lord put the burden on me to help my neighbor. But I have n't done it; the Lord has made this thing work.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> has been a foster parent for the state for 38 years. She said she and her husband still hear from most of her one-time wards. `` They still write or call or drop us a card or come by every now and then,'' she said. `` They still call me Momma and him Daddy. They're our children.''

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> upgraded his assessment of his debate with Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying Tuesday `` maybe we did a little better'' than just a draw. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had tried to play down his forensic skills as he went into the debate, told reporters on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two: `` I feel better today about the way the debate went than I did the night of the debate. `` As I think I told you, I felt it was about even and I now think maybe we did a little better than that in terms of what we needed to do. But I ca n't prove it.'' Asked why his assessment was so much more modest than that of other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Well those are what we call the spin merchants.'' When a reporter expressed surprise that he was willing to use that term, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` I've learned to. We've got different levels of hand wringing in our campaign. `` The lowest levels were relieved that I did n't massively foul it up. It's what we call the relief factor. ... `` And I tell you as that worry factor subsided and it was replaced by what we call the relief factor, you can understand the rising up of exuberance. `` And so there were some proclamations of a ` knockout,' ` clear win,' but some of it was the adrenalin rising in that level of hand-wringers.'' Asked why he would keep hand-wringers on his staff, he replied: `` Because they need to keep me on the ball. I need their advice. I welcome their criticism and advice, unlike others. I know I'm not perfect. This will come as a surprise to you.''

<TEXT>
 Ailing former Teamsters President <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was released from prison Tuesday after serving nearly three years for conspiring to bribe a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator and returned home to his <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> farm. His parole was granted with the condition that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who has testified for the government at two organized crime trials, continue to cooperate with law enforcement authorities. Prosecutors already have said they want his testimony. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 73, who suffers from emphysema and an enlarged heart, left the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoners </ORGANIZATION> at 1 a.m., before the regular hours for processing prisoners, said center officials. He had been imprisoned there since December 1985. `` He did n't want to face a barrage of reporters,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Millin </PERSON>. Millin and a friend of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> drove the former Teamsters leader to his farm in <LOCATION> Leeton </LOCATION>, in west-central <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, the lawyer said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was not available for interviews after his release, and a spokesman said he was not likely to submit to interviews for some time. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON>, another of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' attorney, said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was trying to adjust to life out of prison. `` He's basically trying to be at home and relax and wake up without bars on the windows and people telling him what to do,'' <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> would be paroled in recognition of testimony that `` was at great risk to his personal safety. `` This release is contingent upon his continued cooperation with law enforcement authorities,'' parole commission chairman <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Baer </PERSON> said in a statement Friday. <PERSON> Baer </PERSON> added that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> could be returned to prison if he did not cooperate. <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has requested <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' testimony but he did not know when <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> would be expected to comply. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was convicted in 1982 of conspiring to bribe then-Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, D-Nev., to obtain his help in defeating legislation to deregulate the trucking Cannon was never charged, and the law passed. In an effort to get his 10-year prison sentence reduced, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> testified for federal prosecutors in 1985 that reputed <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> crime boss <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Civella </PERSON> paid him $ 1,500 a month from late 1974 to mid-1981. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he had agreed to help <PERSON> Civella </PERSON>'s organization secure a multimillion-dollar loan from the Teamsters Central States Pension Fund. In 1987, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> testified by videotape in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> racketeering case, saying <PERSON> Civella </PERSON> had ordered him to run for international president of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>.

 A young man who killed two people and wounded a third in a shooting spree at a government building last winter was sentenced Tuesday to the maximum of two consecutive life terms plus 35 \ years in prison <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindh </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, was sentenced by <ORGANIZATION> Dane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pekowsky </PERSON>. A two-week trial ended Saturday when a jury ruled <PERSON> Lindh </PERSON> was sane Jan. 15 when he shot at people at random in the City-County Building with a .22 - caliber rifle, before he was shot by `` There is no remorse reflected in this record, no guilt ... no conscience'' <PERSON> Pekowsky </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lindh </PERSON> was convicted last week of first-degree murder in the deaths of Coroner <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> and county corporation counsel secretary <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>. He also was convicted of attempted first-degree murder in the shooting of another person. <PERSON> Lindh </PERSON> was expressionless throughout the proceeding and simply replied `` no'' when the judge asked if he had anything to say before sentencing. <PERSON> Lindh </PERSON>'s adoptive parents, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindh </PERSON>, and an unidentified young woman sat in the front row hugging and periodically crying. The courtroom also was filled with relatives and friends of <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, many in tears. `` The ramifications of what happened on the 15th of January will be felt a long time,'' <PERSON> Pekowsky </PERSON> said. `` It deserves the most severe sentence I can deal out.'' The judge imposed mandatory life terms plus five years for the murders. The additional five years was added because <PERSON> Lindh </PERSON> used a firearm. The judge also sentenced the defendant to 25 years on the attempted murder charge and 90 days for carrying a firearm into a public building. The judge ordered that the sentences be served consecutively. After the hearing, <PERSON> Lindh </PERSON>'s attorney, state public defender <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, said he will appeal the conviction. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> contended <PERSON> Lindh </PERSON>'s rights were violated when he was questioned twice in his hospital room hours after the shooting. The judge ruled the statements admissable. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> also contended he should have been allowed to cross-examine a key prosecution witness, who said <PERSON> Lindh </PERSON> was not mentally ill, about a separate case in which the witness may face charges before the state <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said he wanted to find out if the witness may have fashioned his testimony to benefit himself in the event charges are filed in the other case. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> also questioned <PERSON> Lindh </PERSON>'s safety in prison.

<TEXT>
 Police increased patrols at the high school and will have all off-duty and reserve officers at the school's homecoming football game Friday to prevent a flare up in recent racial tensions, officials said. `` We're taking extra precautions,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Byington </PERSON>. A small group of white and black students in recent weeks have been pushing and shoving each other and shouting racial slurs on the <ORGANIZATION> Clinton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> campus, <PERSON> Byington </PERSON> said. Similar tensions have arisen in past years in the 71 percent white district, said <PERSON> Byington </PERSON> and School Superintendent <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Belue </PERSON>. The disturbances peaked Friday night, when a white <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> High student was beaten by `` three or four'' black <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> High </PERSON> students at a convenience store, <PERSON> Byington </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Belue </PERSON> said administrators and parents have acted to quell the unrest. On Sunday and Monday, parents met with school and police officials to talk about ways to stop tension. Officials say they're unsure what sparked the tension. `` Sometimes it starts over a disagreement,'' <PERSON> Belue </PERSON> said, adding an incident several years ago started in this town west of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with students fighting over a parking place. `` Some of these things are n't necessarily race-related when they start. `` But when that difference comes up and a white student is on one side and a black student on the other, it's identified as a racial thing,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Israeli warplanes attacked pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem guerrilla bases in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Tuesday, police reported, in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 15th air attack on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. Police said they were unable to compile a casualty report from the 10-minute raid by two jet fighters on bases of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, in pine woods near the Christian town of <LOCATION> Jezzine </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gunners opened up with anti-aircraft guns as the jets staged their dive-bombing sorties at 11:30 a.m. on targets about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. There were no hits, police said. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the Israeli command said the target of the strike was a guerrilla base in a Shiite area near the village of <LOCATION> al-Luwayzah </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of the Christian town of <LOCATION> Marjayoun </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Marjayoun </LOCATION> is the provincial capital of a border `` security zone'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carved out in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985 to serve as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla forays. Smoke billowed from the stricken bases just outside the zone as <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gunmen sealed off the woods west of <LOCATION> Jezzine </LOCATION>, preventing police patrols from taking stock of the losses, said a police spokesman who can not be named under standing rules. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is made up of <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> zealots backed by the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. They have long been waging guerrilla attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone. <LOCATION> Jezzine </LOCATION> is the northern-most position manned by the Israeli-sponsored south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> army militia, which patrols the six-to-10-mile zone. The last previous Israeli air raid was on Friday, when jets raided <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> bases near the southern port city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, killing three guerrillas and wounding five. That brought to 68 people killed and 108 wounded the overall toll from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 14 air strikes since Jan. 3.

<HEAD>Olympics Increase in Ratings But Still Lag Below Guarantee</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s seven nights of Summer Olympics coverage made the top seven prime-time shows in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> television ratings last week despite that coverage is receiving lower-than-anticipated ratings. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had guaranteed advertisers an average 21.2 rating. Last week's coverage ranged from 20.1 to 16.8. A 13.9 was recorded for the half-hour before the presidential debate on Sunday. The 90-minute pre-emption `` seriously affected the overall rating,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehme </PERSON>. Otherwise, the Olympics ratings pretty much rose as the week went on and showed an increase over the disappointing first three nights. If the Olympics rating does n't live up to the guarantee to advertisers, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has to provide them with free commercial time on other programs to make up the difference. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week, nevertheless, with its highest weekly rating in a year, a 19.3 that was also the highest network weekly rating since a win for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> during the Winter Olympics. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was second with a 10.7 and CBS third with a 9.8. The Olympics were good news and bad news for `` NBC Nightly News.'' It probably would have been in first place for the first time since 1987 thanks to the Olympics boost. But it only tied with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> for second place _ because of pre-emptions on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> for live coverage of the Olympics. The `` CBS Evening News'' won the week with 10.1 rating and 20 share. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> `` World News Tonight'' tied NBC with a 9.8. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had a 20 share and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> a 21 share, a result of different time periods that gave <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> a bigger portion of a smaller audience. Each rating point equals 904,000 households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. The week ending Sept. 25 was the first of the official new television season. However, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> are maintaining the season does n't really begin until late October, when all three networks have premiered most of their new fall shows. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS are airing reruns and movies to counter <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s two weeks of Olympics programming. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s Thursday night coverage was the top-rated show of the week, followed by Saturday, Friday, Sunday, Wednesday, Tuesday and Monday. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> followed with its rerun TV movie `` A Stranger Waits,'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> made the top 10 with Tuesday night comedies, `` Head of the Class'' and `` Growing Pains.'' The lowest-rated shows of the week were: `` Cadets,'' `` Live! <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> Presents,'' `` The Best of SCTV,'' `` 48 Hours,'' `` Beauty & amp; the <LOCATION> Beast </LOCATION>,'' `` <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shandling </PERSON> Alone in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>,'' `` Bodywatching,'' `` West 57th,'' `` First Impressions'' and `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place.''

<HEAD>Commitment To 50-State Campaign Appears Not Quite Solid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With six weeks to go to election day, aides to Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are scaling back expectations across parts of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> but express continuing hopes for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and a handful of border states. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> states are still viewed as prime battlegrounds, as well, and practically the entire <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Industrial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> are up for grabs in the view of campaign officials. But one aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the campaign would soon `` begin pulling back budget and pulling back staff'' from some states where chances of victory are dim, and saving them for the more competitive regions. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his aides have pledged frequently to run a 50-state campaign this fall. `` Watch the schedule'' for clues about which states are regarded as more winnable, said one adviser, also speaking on condition he not be identified by name. In his campaigning since the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has appeared sparingly in the Deep South, with the exception of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, home state to running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' recent trip to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> were indications of a continued commitment to several border states in what shapes up as a close election, officials said. Publicly, senior advisers say they will not concede any state to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We are not going to fall into the Republican trap of cutting off parts of the country,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' field director <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who said that the Democrats have assembled a 50-state field organization for the first time in several elections. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, addressing a meeting of Southern governors Tuesday at <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, said, `` We're being realistic, but we're also campaigning here and will continue to do so becuase we think we can be successful in the South.'' Officials hotly dispute that they have reduced efforts in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, with 21 electoral votes, and say they have recently dispatched new aides to the state. They say that talk of scaling back is a Republican-inspired ploy to undermine their chances. But in contrast to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where the campaign is committed to running television advertisements specially created for the state, no similar decision has been made for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. And in contrast to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' periodic visits to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate has been to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> only once since the Democratic convention in July, and is not scheduled to return until Oct. 11. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his advisers have repeatedly pledged their commitment to a 50-state campaign, and at a meeting of campaign officials in July, senior adviser <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> said he promised the directors of the 50 statewide oranizizations that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would commit the necessary resources in each of them. In states such as <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> in the South and traditional Republican strongholds in the West such as <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, campaign officials concede privately they have little chance for success. Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s home state of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> is regarded as an extremely difficult state, as is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, according to officials. In all, the states involved carry roughly 100 Electoral Votes, out of 270 needed for victory in the race for the White House. The states have voted Republican in most recent elections, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials have said all year they would give the Republicans a solid launching pad for their campaign. `` We are not at a point yet in our views to completely write off any states and it is not our plan to do that,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, field director for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` But clearly as this thing tightens up in terms of last-minute media buy decisions and last minute scheduling decisions you've got to make some decisions on how you put together an electoral college majority.'' Another aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it is important to keep states competitive in order to keep the Republicans spending time and resources. `` You see where we are by looking at the schedule but that does n't mean we do n't keep targets of opportunity, either,'' the aide said.

Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday approved an amendment reducing the number of businesses that would have to offer job-protected leave to workers with medical problems or parental responsibilities. But the ultimate fate of the Family and Medical Leave Act remained in doubt as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debated the merits of mandating rather than encouraging employers to offer the benefit. Also hanging was an amendment to toughen penalties for offenses involving child pornography and obscenity. The bill sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., would require employers of 50 or more people to offer at least 10 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to seriously ill employees or those with newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill children Sen. <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, R-Miss., said employers should be encouraged rather than required to respond sensitively to family needs, and said he would propose a tax incentive amendment with that aim <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s initial bill would have exempted only companies of under 20 and required that at least 13 weeks of medical leave be available. Under the revised version, <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said, only 5 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies would have to comply with the leave requirement. Reducing the amount of medical leave from 13 to 10 weeks also reduced the cost, he said, from $ 190 million to $ 160 million _ $ 2.67 per employee per year. `` All this legislation says is that for 10 weeks every two years if you're confronted with a crisis, you do n't lose your job,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said. `` I do n't consider that to be an unreasonable idea. I think it's human decency. I think it's common sense.'' Conservatives called parental leave a worthy, important benefit but said it should n't be imposed on employers. <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> branded the requirement `` a very drastic departure from current practice, and it is not really necessary in trying to deal with the needs of a diverse and changing workforce ... We should all be concerned about the impact it may have on other benefits that may be available.'' `` This will continue to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> less competitive,'' contended Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, R-Idaho. `` Nothing is costless in this society. There's no free lunch.'' <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> said there was no need for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take up time on the leave issue at the end of a session, with other important bills awaiting action. `` I do n't believe the people of this country are in any kind of emergency situation,'' he said. `` We did n't get elected to go home,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> shot back. `` I know these issues are n't easy. We were n't elected to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to make everybody happy. If 51 of my colleagues do n't like this idea, we'll go home.''

<TEXT>
 Laboratory tests show the Shroud of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> was made in the 14th century and could not be the burial cloth of Christ, the scientific adviser to the archbishop of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> said he learned on Tuesday. Professor <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> said he has not yet seen the official report from the three laboratories that conducted the carbon-14 dating tests, but that all the leaks to the press dated it to the 14th century and `` somebody let me understand that the rumors were right.'' `` It is quite evident somebody sold out to the press,'' said <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> in an interview from his home in <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>. He refused to identify who had told him about the results of the tests at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zurich </ORGANIZATION>. The shroud _ 14 feet, 3 inches long and 3 feet, 7 inches wide _ bears the faint, blood-stained image of a whipped and crucified man. Some have maintained the herringbone patterned linen is the burial cloth of Christ, while others have dismissed it as a clever forgery. `` We are certainly disappointed in knowing that the shroud has a medieval date, but this is because it is a cherished object. It's like having a portrait in your attic that turns out not to be a picture of your grandfather But you do n't love him less,'' <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> was quoted as saying to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic news agency, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The shroud was removed April 21 from the silver chest where it is kept wrapped in red silk on an altar in the cathedral in <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>. A strip _ four-tenths of an inch by 2.8 inches _ was cut from the cloth and then divided into three smaller pieces for the laboratories, each of which got one piece, in addition to another piece of cloth of a known age. <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> said the British Museum, which coordinated the study with the three laboratories, reportedly sent the test results to <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> by special courier on Friday. He said he believed <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>'s archbishop, Cardinal <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballestrero </PERSON>, would see the study when he returned to his office Wednesday after a three-day absence The scientist said it was not the church that demanded secrecy and denied holding back the results, which he said will be made public `` quickly'' after Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> is informed. However, he said he could not give a date. `` We are very angry. We are being accused of trying to hide the results, accused of taking part in a conspiracy to hide the truth, of being afraid of the truth,'' <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> said. `` Now everybody is sure we knew the results when we did n't know in any credible way,'' he said, adding that it was the three laboratories and not the church that had asked for secrecy. `` They asked for the blind test. They said they would make no effort to determine which sample came from the shroud. The raw data was to be sent back to the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> where the key to the code would identify the samples from the shroud. Then they would write up the scientific result,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> does not claim the shroud as a holy relic but has treated it with respect because of the possibility it could have been <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s burial cloth, <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> said. He said the church always knew it could not prove that the shroud was the actual burial cloth of Christ, but he bristled at suggestions that a medieval date for the shroud means it is a fake. `` It could be a genuine work of Christian art,'' he said. `` Just because it is not the burial cloth of Christ does not necessarily mean it is a forgery or a fake, which implies an intent to mislead.'' He said the test results would not entirely resolve the centuries-old mystery surrounding the cloth, including how it was made. <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> pointed to the other scientific studies, such as the 1978 Shroud of Turin Project, which could not determine exactly how the image on the shroud was created. French crusader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Clari </PERSON> mentioned seeing the cloth in 1203 in <LOCATION> Constantinople </LOCATION> at the imperial palace, but the first actual records trace it only to <LOCATION> Lirey </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1354. The shroud was bequeathed to the pope by former King <PERSON> Umberto </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savoy </ORGANIZATION>, upon his death in 1983.

 The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> has banned all on-campus fraternity-sorority parties because a woman said she was raped after a similar event off campus, officials said. <PERSON> Stover </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, was charged Friday with rape in the alleged attack after a party off-campus Thursday night, said <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the woman left the party with someone shortly after midnight. She said she was driven to a field three to five minutes away, then beaten and raped. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who has since withdrawn from school, was free on $ 50,000 bond, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Trott </PERSON>, assistant dean of students in charge of fraternities, said the Thursday night `` swaps,'' which bring together an entire fraternity and an entire sorority, would no longer be sanctioned by the university. <PERSON> Trott </PERSON> said the swaps began as a low-key way for freshmen to meet but had evolved into full-scale parties, often involving alcohol and loud music. `` I've been concerned about this for years,'' <PERSON> Trott </PERSON> said. `` This kind of incident capped it off.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON>, assistant dean of students in charge of fraternities, said he would investigate the incident, which followed a party involving <ORGANIZATION> Sigma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epsilon </ORGANIZATION> fraternity and <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Omega </PERSON> sorority. <ORGANIZATION> Interfraternity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Sigma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epsilon </ORGANIZATION> was already on social probation because of a rush infraction and was prohibited from having on-campus parties. <PERSON> Trott </PERSON> said that although the party was off campus, it still reflected on the fraternity-sorority system.

 A veteran firefighter appointed the city's first liaison to the gay and lesbian community said Tuesday he hopes to use his post to promote tolerance and change homophobic attitudes. Fire Inspector <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said he also wants to provide support for other homosexuals in the department and help alleviate tension between the department and the gay community. `` I'll be there to listen,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. `` I'm an openly gay man and I have been out, so to speak, within the department for 15 months. `` Primarily, I hope to address, in one small measure, the issue of violence within the gay community. ... Homophobia, violence, gay bashing and all that. That's what I hope to change,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 41. City officials said they hope the job, believed to be the first of its kind in the country, will improve relations with the gay community, which reached a low point two years ago when three young people reported they were violently attacked by off-duty firefighters shouting anti-gay slurs. `` We have an image within the community of being very macho, sometimes parochial men. It's not wholly true,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who has worked for the department for nine years. `` A lot of these guys, they have brothers and cousins that are gay, they just do n't discuss it.''

 Lt. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>, the first and only director of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` Star Wars'' research program, has decided to retire from the military next February, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The 55-year-old <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>, a three-star <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> general who assumed command of the fledgling <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in April 1984, will be replaced by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman. <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON>'s nomination must be confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON> will retire Feb. 1 after 33 years of active military service, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The general has not announced any future plans. According to documents released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, including a memo from <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, the Star Wars chief decided on his own early this summer to request retirement. <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON> said he had concluded the next president should be allowed to dictate new policies for Star Wars development to a new leadership team. `` I am proud of the people of SDI, who have not indulged themselves with the negative ` it ca n't be done' approach to problems,'' <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON> wrote. `` However, a new administration will undoubtedly have different ideas or approaches to SDI. Therefore, I reluctantly have concluded that the program will best be served by allowing new leadership to represent new policy and direction. As you requested, I will serve until a successful transition is well under way.'' The Star Wars program is an effort to develop lasers and other exotic weapons that could be deployed in space and on the ground to automatically shoot down <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear missiles. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> repeatedly has refused in recent years to fund the program at the pace sought by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but nonetheless has allowed the research to continue. <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>, a former astronaut who never got to fly in space, is credited with putting together a formal organization to oversee the research work _ which is conducted in laboratories around the world _ while serving as an effective `` cheer leader'' to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the business community. Even in his retirement memo to <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON> could n't resist praising the program, saying his Star Wars job had been the best of his career and had `` allowed me to appreciate the daring scope of the president's vision and the genius available to the country to solve this and other daunting challenges. `` I have great confidence that this initiative will go forward and will succeed. I will continue to dedicate myself to SDI to my last day of active duty _ and after.'' <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Williston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, is a Vietnam War combat pilot who trained as an astronaut for the Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program before it was canceled in 1969. In 1981, the general returned to the world of space, serving as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for the shuttle program. He oversaw the first 10 shuttle launches before returning to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and assuming command of the Star Wars effort. <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON>, 54, is a native of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> who is one of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s top procurement officials.

<HEAD>Senate Report: Pentagon Has Trouble Managing Huge Inventory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite reforms, the Pentagon is still doing a poor job of managing its inventory of millions of stockpiled items ranging from aircraft spare parts to food and clothing, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> report said Tuesday. The Pentagon should reduce the huge and growing volume of items it has in its inventory, according to the study by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The report was the latest in a series of studies by the Democratic-controlled panel of how the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> manages its huge stockpile. The studies have been critical of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and have recommended management changes. The studies affect so-called `` secondary items,'' which include spares, repair parts, supplies, food and clothing. That stockpile is in contrast to `` principal items'' like tanks, ships, and airplanes. There has been a large increase in the secondary item stockpile, resulting from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s defense build-up. The secondary stockpile, which now contains about 4.6 million different types of items, is worth $ 94 billion, compared to its $ 43 billion value in 1980. `` The enormous, unprecedented, and unsustainable growth in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s secondary inventory has simply overwhelmed the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s depots, warehouses, and accounting and control systems,'' the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s `` supply system has been unable to cope with the new demands made on it. The management of current inventories has not kept pace with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to spend money on new goods,'' it said. For example, two years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> asked <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to return 24 Stinger hand-held missiles for test firing. The Missile Command sought 24 specific missiles, but service officials in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were able to find only nine by March 1987. Finally, after searching the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s entire European inventory of missiles, service officials were finally able to locate the other 13. Army officials conceded that their policy `` for recording inventory information on small missiles was ambiguous and contained multiple and contradictory control requirements,'' the study said. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials, asked for comment, did not immediately respond. However, they agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> last spring when the congressional watchdog agency raised similar criticisms of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s inventory management. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials conceded they needed to do better. The committee recommended a number of changes, including a halt in the purchase of items not immediately needed and better administrative and internal <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> controls over the vast and widely segmented inventories. One example cited as wasteful spending was the purchase by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> of metal bars used to mount flashing red lights atop emergency and police vehicles used by the services. Because of an increase in demand, the <ORGANIZATION> DLA </ORGANIZATION> bought 4,297 of the bars in February 1986 but shortly after the purchase, the demand dropped. That means that the <ORGANIZATION> DLA </ORGANIZATION> now has enough of the bars to last for the next six years, and stocks of the bars are now clogging the aisles of a SLA warehouse. The panel also said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> needs to improve security at sites where weapons and other potentially dangerous items are stored, a complaint raised in previous hearings. For example, the panel said, its investigators found that Stinger missiles were stored at various sites in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in lightweight metal sheds with the word `` Stinger'' stenciled on the shed's side.

<TEXT>
 A couple who sought a better life in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> following financial setbacks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are back home, saying they are broke, embittered and have been deceived by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cheryle </PERSON> <PERSON> Branch </PERSON>, who returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week after 10 months in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, were staying Tuesday in a small motel in Erie. They had previously lived in nearby Summit Township. `` By Monday, we will be broke so we are going to move into the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Courthouse to live,'' said Branch, 42, referring to the federal courthouse in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>. The Branches said they moved to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because `` we were so mad at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, but not at the people.'' `` We're really mad now,'' he said. The couple claimed that after Soviet officials gave them a furnished apartment and jobs at <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, officials at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> there offered them the same benefits plus help resolving their financial troubles if they returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. However, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said the Branches were offered only the same loan available to any stranded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen to finance passage home. `` They made promises there, and now they are backing out,'' Branch claimed. Branch said that after they arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the Soviets asked them to visit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy because <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials were worried about them. He said they refused because `` we vowed we would never step inside another federal building. They were n't worried about us there, why would they be worried about us here?'' The Soviets asked them in February to assure the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy that they were not being held against their will. Branch claims that during a subsequent meeting, <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrelly-Byrnes </PERSON>, the embassy's second secretary and vice consul, said, `` Do you need money? We have jobs for you. We have a place for you to live and medical care.'' At an August meeting, the embassy officials said they could not help the Branches solve their problems unless they returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Branch </PERSON> said. `` We thought if they were willing to work with us, to make amends, why should we hold a grudge?'' he said. No one greeted them in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as promised, <PERSON> Branch </PERSON> said. `` I think we have been deceived. We have been stripped of everything,'' said Mrs. Branch, 40. `` It is hard to believe that in a democratic society two people could be in such a predicament.'' The couple want to be reimbursed for the $ 3,000 airfare and the motel room. `` The government is heavily indebted to us and why should n't we feel like this?'' said Mrs. Branch. `` It is supposed to be a great democracy.'' `` We would n't be here looking for a job if they had n't promised us,'' <PERSON> Branch </PERSON> said. He said they might return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but are `` tired of moving back and forth across the ocean at somebody's whim.'' The troubles that made the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> look good included the couple's inability to collect $ 10,000 in back wages from <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> despite a federal court judgment in their favor. Land they owned in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was declared part of a flood plain by the federal government and is worthless, Mrs. Branch said.

 A flight attendant testifying at the murder and air piracy trial of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s accomplice killed a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver aboard a hijacked <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner. The attendant, <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hesp </PERSON>, said hijacker <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON> killed diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> after the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jet was commandeered June 14, 1985. The testimony contradicted that of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON>, the plane's pilot, who told the court he believed <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was the hijacker who killed <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> Ms. <PERSON> Hesp </PERSON> also testified that <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON> claimed a friend of his had carried out the bombing mission that killed 241 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1983. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, has admitted hijacking the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner on the Athens-to-Rome flight and holding 39 Americans hostage for 17 days. But said the other hijacker killed <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, Md. Ms. <PERSON> Hesp </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON>, who is at large, `` seemed to be giving the orders'' during the hijacking. The 47-year-old Ms. <PERSON> Hesp </PERSON> said `` Said'' was the name <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON> used during the hijacking. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, she said, called himself `` <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hesp </PERSON> did not name her home or nationality, under guidelines set by the court to protect witnesses in the trial, some of whom have said they feared reprisals. Her speech had a British accent. Outside the courtroom at Preungesheim prison, security remained tight as it has been since the trial began July 5. There were about two dozen policemen near the entrance, and at least three carried machine guns. Asked by the court judge if she knew who killed the 23-year-old <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Hesp </PERSON> paused, then said: `` Yes. But I did not see the shot, so it is only my opinion. It would be my opinion that it would be Said who shot.'' She added: `` They were both terrifying, of course, but of the two men it is my feeling that <PERSON> Said </PERSON> was the more vicious.'' `` I remember when we first took off from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and they punched our heads down and they were running up and down screaming,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hesp </PERSON> said. `` I remember I was always more afraid when I saw the white shoes, because I knew they belonged to Said.'' Other witnesses, including flight engineer <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>, have testified <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON> was the more violent of the two hijackers, but that both seemed to have equal authority. When asked to comment, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who sat quietly through much of the testimony with his elbow propped on the table and chin in his left palm, told the court in Arabic through his translator he had nothing to say. Throughout the trial, the court has given <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> the opportunity to comment without having to take the witness stand.

Across the courtroom, facing <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, the parents of the slain <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver, took notes and listened quietly.

<HEAD>GAO Says Export Promotion Programs In `State Of Disorder'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> charged Tuesday that export promotion programs run by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> are doing more to confuse <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses seeking to market their products abroad than to help them. <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, a Democrat who heads the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> government operations subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs, said a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study requested by the subcommittee concluded that the department's management of trade shows and trade missions abroad is in `` a state of disorder.'' `` Instead of helping <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses to get into the export business, it seems that the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is doing more to confuse and frustrate anyone who thinks about selling abroad,'' <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> said. `` This situation must be remedied without delay.'' A draft copy of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report, released by the subcommittee, said about 55 percent of the major trade events scheduled abroad by the department's <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 were canceled. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the frequent cancellation of advertised trade shows or missions `` has limited the credibility of the program in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business community and in some overseas locations.'' <PERSON> Desiree </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> ITA </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency has reviewed the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report and is preparing a written response. Major responsibility for export promotion programs abroad lies with the <ORGANIZATION> ITA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which has 155 commercial officers in 66 countries. The agency, which also has offices in 48 states, had a $ 68.9 million budget in fiscal 1987, with $ 39.2 million for foreign operations. Two other ITA divisions share the responsibility for export promotion programs, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said, and a lack of coordination among the three units has resulted in poor planning and execution of trade events and a lack of accountability. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> also criticized the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for failing in three attempts since 1978 to develop a computerized trade information data base that would provide up-to-date international marketing and trade information to government and business officials. A `` very limited'' version of the data base is supposed to be operational by tne end of the year, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. Full implementation is expected to cost $ 39.9 million through 1993, not including the $ 13.4 million spent on the two previous attempts to computerize the trade data.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, in a move bound to reassure <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that East-West troop reduction talks would not be expanded to cover nuclear weapons. But it still was not clear when the negotiations might begin despite President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statement that they would open soon and discussions this week at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The negotiations between the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact are intended to reduce non-nuclear forces, tanks and other mobile weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevenement </PERSON>, during talks Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, are expected to reject any Soviet attempt to use the forum to promote nuclear weapons reductions. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> agreed to the negotiations only with reluctance. The French are determined to protect their independent nuclear force from cutbacks under joint U.S.-Soviet pressure. In fact, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is planning to deploy a new tactical missile system. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, at a news conference here, said flatly: `` The talks will not be expanded to include nuclear weapons. They are confined to conventional weaons.'' The start of negotiations has been delayed by a dispute over human rights. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sought assurances from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that there would be a simultaneous improvement in human rights conditions in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The issue was discussed at meetings that Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said afterward that the Spviets had promised to release 27 political prisoners and to reform their emigration regulations. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a speech Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said the East-West talks would open soon. Both Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, in separate meetings Tuesday with reporters, said the chances were good the talks would be held this year. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> said, however, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` certainly did not erase all of the differences.'' She said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials reviewed the situation this week with West European allies attending the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> session. `` I think there's a sense here that the last issues have been defined,'' she said. `` But there is nothing that has been done here to specifically _ on a case-by-case basis _ to change the situation.''

 A teacher who was wounded while trying to stop a gunman during a fatal shooting spree in an elementary school, and then held the man for police, `` thinks about others before herself,'' colleagues said. An 8-year-old was killed and two teachers and eight students were wounded in Monday's attack at <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` He seemed to be shooting people who were screaming,'' said School Superintendent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>. `` The teacher said those who were screaming or making noise, he shot them.''

Solicitor <PERSON> Townes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said his office will consider pursuing the death penalty. A 7-year-old who was shot in the neck was returned to surgery Tuesday because of complications and was in critical condition. <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> walked through the school's front door Monday morning, went to the cafeteria and opened fire with a .22 - caliber, nine-shot revolver, wounding one teacher and three He left the cafeteria and entered a girl's restroom to reload. Physical education teacher <PERSON> Kat </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON> followed and tried to prevent him from leaving the room, <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON> said, but when they scuffled Ms. <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON> was shot in the hand and mouth. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> got by Ms. <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON> and opened fire in a classroom, wounding five students and killing <PERSON> Shequila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawonn </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON> said.

Ms. <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON> told him to raise his hands and made him stay in place until a police officer arrived, the chief said.

When she heard a physical education teacher had helped stop the gunman, `` I knew immediately it had to be her.

<HEAD>American Book Exhibit Opens In Moscow</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Dozens of Soviet readers got a tantalizing look Tuesday at American books that most of them still can not buy. The exhibit of several thousand volumes is the latest foreign joint venture to offer Western products for the foreign currency that few are permitted to hold. Soviets can order the books by mail from publishers. Soviets browsed among books such as an atlas with more detailed and accurate maps of their own country than those published by Soviet map makers; a handbook on future <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> missions; fiction by once-banned native authors and a book by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Despite the currency limitations and the exhibit's obscure location _ behind two gates and in a corner of an international exhibition hall _ the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> organizers were grateful. `` It ai n't Gorky Street,'' a popular <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> shopping area, acknowledged <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> of the firm <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Liebowitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Latham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But Gorky Street is next on <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s agenda. He hopes a store that accepts Soviet rubles will open within a year. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> defended the current, hard-to-find site because `` having the -LRB- Soviet -RRB- public come in is counterproductive'' as long as they lack the right money to spend. Only the few Soviets with hard currency legally obtained through such means as a trip abroad, and retained in a Soviet bank account, will be able to order books from the exhibit, said <PERSON> Dmitry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamleev </PERSON>, deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION>, Printing and Book Trade. The yearlong exhibit will cater to Soviet libraries and Soviet businesses with hard currency such as dollars. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publishers chose to send largely scientific and technical works sought by Soviet institutional customers. American fiction was nearly non-existent. The handful of volumes included <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>'s `` Roots,'' and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>'s `` The Right Stuff'' and `` Bonfire of the Vanities.'' The books can be ordered for the regular <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> price plus 10 percent, but most customers will have to wait as long as four months for delivery, according to the Soviet government's distributor, the International Books agency <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Belostotsky </PERSON>, deputy director of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION>, gave assurances that any book ordered through his agency will reach its buyer, despite a Soviet history of prohibiting individual importation of most foreign publications. Other joint ventures in the Soviet Unio with goods available only for foreign currency include Baskin-Robbins ice cream and British beer.

 The heavy traffic in the heart of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, can be unforgiving, even for the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and his wife. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s departure from The <LOCATION> Waldorf-Astoria </LOCATION> hotel was delayed for about 20-30 minutes Tuesday when his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, was held up in traffic returning from another part of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s long motorcade was wrapped around the hotel at the corner of 50th Street and <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. While frustrated <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> motorists leaned on their horns, the president's party held fast while they awaited the first lady. That did n't put a damper on things, however, for the thousands of New Yorkers who poured out onto the streets in the early afternoon sun to witness the presidential party's motorcade as it wended its way through streets totally cleared for its passage to a heliport in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seemed to go out of her way to assure reporters that the delay was unavoidable. `` I got stuck in traffic,'' she said as she joined the president in boarding <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One at <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for the return trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

Asked whether the president had gotten angry over the delay, she smiled broadly, looked in his direction, and said, `` No.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> conducted two days of talks with a host of foreign leaders and addressed the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' General Assembly.

 It's hard finding a good baby sitter these days, especially when the baby in question is a chimp.

It's easier for him to get to know you than the other way around He seems to know exactly what you say to him.'' <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>'s not your average chimp, of course. He wears clothes and shoes, eats at the table, watches TV and plays with toys. He also showers, dresses himself and brushes his teeth. He has developed his own brand of sign language for communicating. <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION>'s responsibilities include preparing <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>'s food and seeing that he follows basic house rules. `` Being with <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> is more confining than caring for a child,'' she said. `` You ca n't send him out in the yard to play by himself.

<HEAD>Agency Says Aquaculture Production Is Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Aquaculture production in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which includes fish farming, has grown by 20 percent a year since 1980, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Production includes food and non-food fish, shellfish and aquatic plants, the department's economic research unit said. `` Domestic production of food fish and shellfish amounted to an estimated 700million pounds in 1987 and was worth almost $ 550 million at the farm gate, compared with 203 million pounds and $ 191 million in 1980,'' the agency said. `` Last year, non-food aquacultural production included, among other items, $ 71.5 million of baitfish and $ 23 million of tropical fish.'' The report by the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency was the first in six years. When aquaculture began to move up as an agricultural enterprise, reports were issued in 1980, 1981 and 1982. They were dropped after that as an economy measure. `` During the 1980s, Americans have substantially increased the quantity of fish and shellfish in their diets despite the fact that seafood prices have risen considerably faster than those for some major competing sources of dietary protein,'' the report said. Per capita consumption of all fishery products rose 18 percent to 20.2 pounds in 1987 from an estimated 17.1 pounds in 1980. The largest sources of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishery products are domestic wild harvests and imports, the report said. Commercial fishermen landed a record 11 billion pounds of fish and shellfish last year, with a wholesale value of $ 3.6 billion, an increase of 1.8 billion pounds and $ 500 million from 1986. Imports were valued at a record $ 8.8 billion in 1987, led by $ 1.7 billion worth of fresh and frozen shrimp. Lobster and tuna were next at $ 600 million and $ 500 million, respectively.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday he will introduce legislation to create a 14-member panel to study the savings and loan crisis and make recommendations to the next president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> early next year. The bill, to be sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, is similar to legislation that passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. The effort to create study commissions comes as debate is intensifying over the need for a taxpayer bailout of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators say $ 31 billion is required to rescue the industry However, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' auditing wing, and others say $ 50 billion or more _ with at least some of it coming from taxpayers _ will be needed. In July, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> rejected another measure to create a study commission, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> had objected, saying that Republicans would be too heavily represented on <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>' commission The 14-member <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> commission would have six members appointed by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, four by <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders and two by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The next president would appoint the remaining two.

 Former House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, an unabashed liberal, awkwardly came to the aid of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Tuesday following weeks of Republican efforts to paint the Democratic presidential nominee as a liberal. Republican candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and others have repeatedly called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a liberal `` out of the mainstream'' of American politics. `` I'm an old-fashioned liberal,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said in drawing a contrast between himself and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He's a progressive, he's a technician, he's a leader.'' At a news conference, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> also chided <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for forgetting his roots in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and `` slurring'' <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in recent remarks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was born in suburban <PERSON> Milton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. In the presidential debate Sunday night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called one <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration program `` phony'' and added sarcastically, `` or one of those other marvelous <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> adjectives.'' `` I certainly am resentful of the slurring manner he talked about <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> _ as though we were n't Americans and did n't love our flag and our country,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. When asked for a response, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said, `` I think Tip should have stuck to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> ads.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Methodist minister was taken from his home early Tuesday and detained by police who claimed he violated a ban on calls for an election boycott, the clergyman's wife reported Church colleagues confirmed that the Rev. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbabane </PERSON>'s detention as the Methodist and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches released the text of pastoral letters urging their followers to consider refusing to vote in nationwide municipal elections on Oct. 26 Also on Tuesday, a bomb exploded outside a police station in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, damaging a door and breaking windows but causing no injuries, police said. Most of the more than 50 bombings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> this year have been blamed on the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. The government says the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> intends to step up its bombing and sabotage campaign in the weeks leading to the elections. <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbabane </PERSON> said officers who took her 55-year-old husband from his home at about 12:45 a.m. Tuesday in the black township of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> alleged that the minister had preached against participation in next month's elections. She said her husband had not advocated an election boycott but had conveyed the <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal to its congregations to consider carefully whether they should vote. Methodist leaders sent out a pastoral letter saying abstention from voting would be the only way for some voters to convey their rejection of apartheid. The letter said, `` Only candidates who are openly and sincerely committed to the complete abolition of apartheid are worthy of Christian support.'' The Southern African <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> issued a similar letter. <LOCATION> Mbabane </LOCATION> is a regional vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The chairman of his district, the Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Storey </PERSON>, said in a statement: `` The authorites must have taken leave of their senses to remove someone of Mr. <PERSON> Mbabane </PERSON>'s stature and integrity from <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> at this tense time.'' Oct. 26 will be the first time South Africans of all races go to the polls the same day. Anti-apartheid activists generally oppose taking part in segregated local elections while the black majority is excluded from full participation in national elections. A state-of-emergency regulation bans calls for an election boycott, but Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and many other activist clergymen defied the ban. Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Air Force Docking Thiokol On MX Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, dissatisfied with the pace of safety improvements after a disastrous fire at a <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plant, has begun docking the company a portion of contract payments for work on the MX missile, the service and company said Tuesday. The company was notified on Aug. 30 that 15 percent of each month's payment would be withheld, said Capt. <PERSON> Kathi </PERSON> <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Air Force Systems Command. On Sept. 6, the first penalty was applied, and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is now withholding $ 767,208 from the firm, the spokeswoman said. `` We took this action because of <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s lack of compliance with contract requirements in that the company has failed to ensure that its employees follow operating procedures, and that there has been a general deterioriation of the housekeeping practices related to safety,'' she added in a prepared statement. <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> holds two <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> contracts calling for production of first-stage rocket motors for the huge MX _ or <LOCATION> Peacekeeper </LOCATION> _ nuclear ballistic missile. One contract was awarded in fiscal 1985 and totals $ 93.5 million, and the second was awarded the following year and totals $ 144.3 million. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>'s manufacturing plant, 25 miles west of <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, was shaken by an explosion and fire on Dec. 29, 1987, that left five workers dead. The men were working in a special building known as a casting pit, where solid rocket fuel is poured and set inside the rocket engine's cylinder. The company was fined last March by the state of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> for safety violations in connection with the accident. A 1986 audit performed by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, obtained after the accident, complained of `` marginal'' industrial safety and fire protection procedures at the plant. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> declined Tuesday to spell out in detail why it was now penalizing the company by withholding contract payments, suggesting only that the firm had failed to meet the requirements of an `` action plan'' it put together to ensure safe operations after the fire. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s prepared statement referred to `` deficiencies'' in `` operating procedures.'' `` Measurable improvements in safety and housekeeping procedural compliance must be accomplished before reinstatement occurs,'' the statement said. `` There is not a set date for compliance. The length of time necessary to resolve deficiencies ... is dependent on <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to effectively ensure employee compliance with operating procedures. <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, agreed Tuesday the company had been informed contract payments were being withheld but said he could not discuss details of what prompted the move. `` We're working very closely with them and we expect to get back in compliance with the contract before very long, but it has been a difficult process,'' <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. The spokesman said he could not predict when the company would satisfy the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s concerns.

 In the aftermath of a dispute with three subordinates, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> on Tuesday spelled out requirements governing contacts by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In a memo to department officials, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> directed that all department personnel `` observe operating procedures'' to be sent `` from time to time'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, headed by Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> also asked that department employees `` carefully follow'' the office's legislative guidance. `` If we are to fulfill the duties and obligations of the Department, it is essential that we speak with one voice to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in the memo, which was distributed to reporters. `` There has been and should contiue to be vigorous internal debate over legislative policy,'' said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. `` However, once policy decisions have been made, we should work together using all of our resources.'' The request comes a week after three agency heads went to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and opposed a legislative compromise <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had worked on to create an inspector general to investigate some components of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In what department sources subsequently described as an angry meeting, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> bluntly told the three to drop their opposition to the compromise. The three agency heads who spoke against the compromise to Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, were <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>. Their agencies would be stripped of current internal inspection and audit powers under the legislation. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had reluctantly endorsed the compromise, saying the alternative would be a more drastic approach placing the entire department under the scope of an inspector general's investigative and audit authority. Currently, the department's Office of Professional Responsibility investigates allegations of wrongdoing within the department.

 Soybean price support loan rates for the 1988 crop will be $ 4.77 per bushel, unchanged from last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. That was also unchanged from the preliminary support rate announced Aug. 12. All soybean producers will be eligible for the loan program, officials said. Soybean market prices are currently around $ 8 per bushel, far above the loan rate _ the amount farmers can borrow from the government by using their crop as collateral. Prices rose as a result of smaller supplies this year. The harvest, reduced by drought, is estimated at about 1.47 billion bushels, down 23 percent from 1987 production.

 The Most Rev. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> announced his retirement Tuesday as bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, citing health reasons. The announcement by the 68-year-old <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION> native came as a surprise. <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>, who has served for 14 years as spiritual leader of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s 278,000 Catholics, will continue to administer the statewide diocese until Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> names a successor. Meeting with reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> did not elaborate on his medical condition but acknowledged a history of blood pressure problems and said he has been on a low-salt, low-cholesterol diet for some time. `` It's just the general aging process, I guess, that's caught up with me,'' he said, adding that he consulted with medical advisers and concluded that he was no longer able to sustain the schedule, responsibilities and expectations of his post. `` People tell me now that I've never looked better. Perhaps it's because I made the decision -LRB- to retire -RRB- that accounts for the healthful look,'' he said <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> declined to speculate on his successor, citing the confidentiality of the process. It normally takes three to six months for the pope to name a replacement, said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutty </PERSON>, director of communications for the diocese. Speculation immediately focused on <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s auxiliary bishop, <PERSON> Amedee </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Proulx </PERSON>, who was elevated to the episcopacy in 1975, becoming the first Franco-American bishop in the state's history and, at 43, the youngest. <PERSON> Proulx </PERSON>, who was not present at <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>'s announcement, characterized the resignation as `` a sad loss'' for the diocese and praised <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>'s 42 years of service to the church. <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> was educated at <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s Seminary in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>.

 Columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> testified Tuesday that police officials told his son there would be `` no problem'' if <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> handled a weapon that he used to wound a teen-ager intruding in his backyard. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, an outspoken opponent of handgun use and possession, has been charged with using an unregistered handgun in the June 14 shooting of an intruder in his backyard. If convicted of the misdemeanor charges, the 63-year-old syndicated columnist could face up to two years in prison and a $ 2,000 fine. In 1982, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s son, then an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, left a .22 - caliber pistol in his father's bedroom after the columnist had received death threats from persons purporting to be members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> His son was told by District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> police officials that he had a `` blanket exemption'' from the city's tough handgun registration laws because he was a federal agent, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> also told the court. Earlier, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, testified that twice in 1982, and once when he was preparing to leave the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in 1983, he was told by police that he did not have to register weapons he had purchased for personal use. After telling police that other members of his family might handle the weapon, `` they told me that as long as -LRB- the gun -RRB- was where it lawfully should be, if others have access to it, it is n't a problem,'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> testified <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s attorneys have maintained that the columnist and his son were given inaccurate advice by members of the police department's gun control unit about the city's gun registration policy, which stipulates that a weapon can be used only by its registered owner A police official also testified that <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> broke the law by using the unregistered weapon, but said he should not have been prosecuted because he apparently was defending his property. Police Inspector <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, introduced by <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s attorney as an expert witness on gun registration matters, told the court that <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> was not authorized to handle the weapon used to shoot a youth who had taken an unauthorized swim in his backyard pool. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, however, testified that he would have recommended <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> not be prosecuted, since a police investigation revealed that the columnist thought he was acting in self-defense. Detective <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who arrived at <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s house immediately after the June 14 shooting, told the court that a sliding glass door at the rear of the house showed signs that someone had tried to force it open. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> could not say when the door was damaged. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> had claimed that he shot <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, because he was afraid <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was trying to enter his home. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> also testified that evidence indicated that the shooting had taken place at close range, near the door. `` I do n't see how we could be doing much better,'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, said after the proceedings

 The House on Tuesday approved a compromise spending bill appropriating $ 14.8 billion for the operations of the federal judiciary and the State, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION> for the fiscal year starting Saturday. The vote was 269-141 on the measure worked out by negotiators for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which previously had approved two separate bills. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has to approve the compromise bill before it can be sent to the White House for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s signature The total is $ 761 million or 5 percent more than was approved last year but $ 655 million or 4 percent less than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's request. Although some agencies received major increases _ including the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, which is preparing for the 1990 census _ the budgets of some others were frozen or cut back. These include the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust division and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Minority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the Patent and <ORGANIZATION> Trademark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s maintenance program for buildings abroad; and the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the office of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative The agencies, which are required to absorb a recently approved 4.1 percent pay increase, likely will face hiring freezes, furloughs and reductions in force. The overall bill has a number of provisions unrelated to funding. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, for example, is required to reverse a recent ruling and prohibit radio stations from broadcasting obscene or profane language at any time of the day or night. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> had approved so-called adult broadcasting between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m. The bill also creates the new position of `` special envoy to the Afghan resistance'' with the rank of ambassador to coordinate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward Afghan resistance fighters.

<HEAD>First Female Bishop-Elect Says Reaction Positive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said Tuesday she was `` a little incredulous'' at being elected the first female bishop of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, but she believes her historic status wo n't overshadow her work Some members of the church have objected to bringing a woman into the line of apostolic succession, but Episcopalian officials said they do n't expect the election will split parishes or stall the ratification process. `` I have ... been elected bishop of the church and not a symbol or a token and my whole emphasis is ... on the role to which I have been elected,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said at a news conference at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where she was elected Saturday `` I do not feel that much emphasis needs to be placed on what some people see as the historic or symbolic significance,'' the 58-year-old <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> priest said. A few `` no'' votes were heard when <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was elected to the position of suffragan, or assisting bishop, for the eastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> diocese, but <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said she has n't personally encountered opposition. `` Since I have no communication with some of those groups at the moment, I would have nothing to say.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said she was shocked when she learned she had been elevated from associate at the Church of the Advocate in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to suffragan of the nation's largest Episcopal diocese, with 155,000 members. `` The reaction that I have received has been overwhelmingly positive, from bishops, from fellow clergy, from lay people, throughout the country,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. The election touched off strong opposition in the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, which does not elect women to the priesthood. The Bishop of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the Rt. Rev. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, has said that he would be unable to recognize a woman bishop, but <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said that is not a new development. `` Bishop <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> has said that for some time now,'' she said. The Rt. Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the bishop of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, said questions about how <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> would deal with opposition are hypothetical since she has not been consecrated yet, adding that the two would work together on overcoming any possible resistance. The election must be ratified by a majority of the bishops heading the nation's 120 dioceses and a majority of the standing committees. As a transitional measure, parishes have the option of requesting that male bishops visit them if they feel they can not accept a woman bishop, but the request is only good for six years and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who voted against the measure, would have to approve it. He said he has not yet had any such request.

 Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., on Tuesday branded as `` absolutely false'' allegations that he sexually assaulted a 26-year-old woman who spent the night at his home last year `` My family and I have been harassed by this woman for over a year,'' a somber <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> told reporters in his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> office as his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, stood at his side. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said the woman sought $ 400,000 in `` hush money'' after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney declined to prosecute the case. `` I will not be blackmailed ... I am completely outraged. These charges are absolutely false,'' he said. The woman was identified by <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and in a report she filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Kari </PERSON> <PERSON> Tupper </PERSON>, her maiden name. She has since married <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 61, a former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> secretary in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, acknowledged he made an `` error in judgment'' by inviting the woman, who he said was a long-time family friend he had known since her childhood, to stay at his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, house on March 27, 1987 when his wife was out of town. He said he offered to let her sleep over because she was `` upset about her job and not feeling well.'' The woman lived in suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` Looking back, I should have called her a cab, but at the time, the suggestion seemed appropriate,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said in a statement. He refused to answer questions beyond the statement. The woman, now married and living in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, filed a report with the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on July 24, 1987, alleging that her breasts and buttocks had been fondled while she was in <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' house nearly four months earlier. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was not identified by name in the report. She alleged that the incident took place between 9:15 p.m. on March 27 and 6:30 a.m. the next day, according to the report. Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said the allegation of simple assault was investigated. `` We consider the matter closed,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION>, which reported the story Tuesday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, which prosecutes offenses in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, reviewed the case, but did not press charges. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> di </PERSON> <PERSON> Genova </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney at the time, told the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, `` It was handled like any other case and nothing was found. We reviewed and found it totally baseless.'' The woman could not be reached and her husband refused to comment. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> gave the following account of what happened last year: He said the woman, whom he had helped find a job on Capitol Hill after his election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, had asked to meet him March 27, 1987 at a swank <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> to discuss job opportunities. When <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> called her office that day to confirm the dinner date, he was told she was ill. Assuming the meeting was off, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he went to play tennis with three friends. Later that night, the woman, upset that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> had not showed up at the restaurant, called him at his home to ask if she could drop by, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. The woman had visited the house in the past and had stored belongings in the basement. After the woman arrived, the pair went to a neighborhood restaurant but found it closed. Neither was feeling very well, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said, so they returned to his home to get her car. Once there, the woman went back inside the house. `` At this point I told her I was exhausted and was going to sleep,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` I told her that she was welcome to stay at the house if she was not well enough to drive home. She said she preferred to stay and then I went to bed, alone. I did not sexually assault the woman.'' The woman was a legislative assistant with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging in 1987 when the alleged incident occurred, the <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> reported.

<HEAD>New Government Board To Police Film Colorization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday sets up a government board to police the practice of film colorization. The bill, appropriating $ 10.5 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and related agencies, sets up a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> within the department with a budget of $ 100,000. The board is to establish a national film register labeling movies according to their cultural, historical and aesthetic interest. The board would make a report in the event alterations, such as colorization, were made in a registered film. If the Patent and Copyright Office found a copyright infringement, it would be required to apply to the appropriate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office for a temporary restraining order and make recommendations for civil proceedings. The Office of Management and Budget expressed concern about this provision of the bill, saying it would inject the <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copyright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> into an area that is normally the province of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

 A grand jury concluded that a black teen-ager concocted a story of rape and abduction by a gang of white men that led to months of racial tension and cover-up allegations, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. The special state grand jury decided not to indict anyone after finding overwhelming evidence that 16-year-old <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> of Wappingers Falls lied and helped create the conditions in which she was found, dazed, wrapped in a garbage bag and smeared with excrement, the Times reported. The black teen-ager claimed she had been kidnapped by a gang of white men on Nov. 24 and subjected to four days of sexual abuse. But the grand jury, in <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION>, concluded after more than 100 witnesses and a variety of evidence that she had chosen not to return home and hid for four days in an apartment from which her family had recently been evicted, the Times said. The grand jury speculated she may have feared punishment from her mother's boyfriend for her late nights out, and that drugs and her relationships with shady characters may have played a role, the Times said. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s story attracted national attention, especially when she refused to testify on the advice of family lawyers and advisers, who then repeatedly accused the state of a cover-up and leveled charges against public officials and the news media. The grand jury subpoenaed Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> but eventually abandoned hope of ever hearing her story firsthand and rescinded its vote to subpoena her, the <ORGANIZATION> Poughkeepsie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. Prominent people who spoke sympathetically of her plight included heavyweight boxing champion <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> and actor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, who put up a $ 25,000 reward. One of Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s advisers, the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, said Tuesday that he would not be surprised if the grand jury concluded, as reported, that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> fabricated her claims. `` We said from the beginning the grand jury would not come back with anything,'' he said. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said the Times article was `` nothing but a whole series of reckless speculations by someone who can not back it up with one iota of fact.'' The black activist repeated charges that the criminal justice system does not treat minorities fairly. `` Tawana is only the last race case that a grand jury has suggested -LRB- was -RRB- a fantasy,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> told reporters outside <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, where he appeared for a proceeding stemming from his arrest last December at a civil rights protest. He said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, her mother <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON>, who claimed sanctuary in churches after she was sentenced to 30 days in jail for defying a subpoena to testify on the case, and their attorneys would appear at a news conference in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> within 24 hours to respond to the report. In addition to <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> and her family have been represented by attorneys <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. The grand jury was not expected to comment on the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> advisers' tactics, but Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, who was appointed special prosecutor in the case, has said he will file a separate complaint against the lawyers when the grand jury report is released. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> issued a statement in response to the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> report saying he would not `` confirm or deny the accuracy of any aspect of the story.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, said he was not surprised by the grand jury's determination as reported by the Times. `` It's certainly worth a serious inquiry'' into whether lawyers involved in the case violated ethical rules of their profession, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said. The grand jury completed its report Friday but it still must be reviewed by state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingrassia </PERSON>, the Times said. It is expected to be released within weeks. The grand jury is to end its work Oct. 7. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> has moved with her family to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where she is attending high school. Their telephone number is unpublished and The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> was unable to reach the family for comment. A neighbor who would not give her name said a van pulled up to the Brawleys' home Tuesday and the family packed up and moved out. But <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Padgett </PERSON>, senior vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, which manages the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> complex, said he had no reason to suspect the family had moved and that they had paid rent through September. The Times said it obtained evidence summaries compiled in June and July as well as a summary dated July which contained all material presented to the grand jury by then and was the last one to be compiled. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said he asked one of his deputies to investigate the unauthorized disclosure of grand jury material.

<HEAD>ABC Polls Says More Call Debate a Tie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Perceptions of Sunday's presidential debate as a dead heat have increased, with a plurality of respondents in a national poll now saying there was no clear winner. Forty-two percent in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll conducted Monday night said the debate was a tie or did n't know who won _ more than double the 20 percent who expressed one of those views after the debate Sunday night. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s and other post-debate polls Sunday night indicated no clear debate winner, and the network's Monday poll indicated that news reports portraying the confrontation as a tie had increased perceptions of it as such. The new poll, released Tuesday, included likely voters who had not seen the debate but had heard or read about it. The first poll was just among those who had watched some or all of the debate. In the new poll, 34 percent said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the debate _ down from 44 percent who said so Sunday _ and 24 percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won, down from 36 percent who held that view Sunday. A plurality of those who picked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a majority of those who picked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said they won only by a little. The poll indicated that the debate reinforced preferences rather than changing them. Eighty percent said the debate had not switched their vote and majorities said it had not made them more likely to vote for either candidate. More than nine in 10 who picked a winner plan to vote for that man; those who called it a tie were split evenly in candidate preference. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> conducted the poll among 416 likely voters who had watched the debate, read about it or heard about it. The margin of error was plus or minus six percentage points.

<HEAD>Streep Debuts as Lobbyist, Urges Action on Pesticides</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Actress Meryl Streep played lobbyist Tuesday when she urged lawmakers to approve stepped up safety regulation of 2.6 billion pounds a year of chemical pesticides sprayed on crops. `` I'm blatantly trying to draw attention to the issue, mostly because of the safety of my children's food supply,'' <PERSON> Streep </PERSON> told reporters as she arrived at the office of Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is considering legislation that would sharply accelerate safety reviews of pesticides and the banning of those found too dangerous for use. It would require manufacturers to pay for the process as well as the cost of storing and disposal of dangerous chemicals. So-called government indemnity payments to pesticide makers whose products are banned _ $ 20 million so far _ would be ended under the plan to reauthorize the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. Streep expressed surprise at the pack of reporters waiting for her at <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>'s office but took it in stride, brushing back a wave of blond hair and saying, `` Well, hi, guys.'' A statement issued afterward by <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>'s office, however, said she was `` startled by press interest in her visit.'' `` I'm obviously not a professional lobbyist,'' the statement quoted her as saying. `` I'm just sincerely concerned on a personal level. This is a personal project I've adopted and I'm so interested in it that you're going to get sick of seeing me on these issues.''

<TEXT>
 By the year 2000, Hispanics will outnumber blacks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, and 15 years later, European whites will no longer be the majority population, according to a new study. Indeed, sometime in the first two decades, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> will join <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> as states with no ethnic majority, according to the report, `` The Population and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>: 1990 to 2050,'' released Monday. `` The rapid growth, numerically as well as proportionately, among groups who traditionally have not fared very well educationally or economically raises the potential for a two-tiered social structure with non-Hispanic whites and many Asians at the top and most blacks and Hispanics at the bottom,'' said the authors, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouvier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bouvier </PERSON> is an adjunct professor of sociology at <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dominion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, a private think tank which published the report <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> is a professor of labor and industrial relations at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, N.Y. The study's population projections for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are higher than those of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> of the Census and the Data Center of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. Those two agencies expect the Empire State's population to reach 18.5 million by 2000, but <PERSON> Bouvier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> say it may reach 19.6 million. The two researchers also predict that the number of New Yorkers of European descent will drop from 12.6 million in 1990 to 9.6 million in 2020 and 5.2 million in 2050. Meanwhile, the black population will double, from 2.8 million now to 5.7 million in 2020, dipping to 4.8 million in 2050. If the current high levels of immigration continue, and the fertility rate among white Europeans stays the same, the number of Hispanics in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> will increase, from 2.5 million now to 5.6 million in 2020, and 8.8 million in 2050, the report said. Over the same period, the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> population will rise from less than 700,000 now to more than 3.1 million in 2050, according to <PERSON> Bouvier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 About 15,000 policemen and law enforcement officers have been sent to the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region to prevent further ethnic violence, a government official said Tuesday. But he said the situation was returning to normal in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, an Armenian-dominated enclave of the southern republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> that has pressed for its unification with neighboring Armenian republic. The official, <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignatov </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s organizational and inspection directorate, appeared at a news briefing in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to explain measures taken to quell the simmering unrest. His comments indicated that Soviet authorities still regard the situation in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> as potentially explosive. <PERSON> Ignatov </PERSON> said 30 buildings were set afire in recent unrest there and that a crowd in the region's center, <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, placed the local prosecutor's home under `` virtual siege'' and broke down doors. He did not say when the siege occurred. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> reported last Thursday that protesters attacked the prosecutor's office. A government spokesman said last week that one man was killed and 48 people were injured in clashes that began Sept. 18 between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. A `` special situation'' was declared last Wednesday in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and in the adjacent <LOCATION> Agdam </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, a 9 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew was imposed and demonstrations were banned. About 600 people have been detained for curfew violations, <PERSON> Ignatov </PERSON> said, and residents' hunting firearms have been temporarily confiscated. But <PERSON> Ignatov </PERSON> said no crimes have been committed since the curfew took effect and authorities were considering shortening it. The 15,000 extra law enforcement officers are mostly from the militia, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s uniformed police force, <PERSON> Ignatov </PERSON> said. He did not say whether all were sent to <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and Agdam, or whether some were deployed to other regions of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Hundreds of troops have been reported on the streets of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, where a general strike began Sept. 16. <PERSON> Ignatov </PERSON> also accused an independent pro-unification group in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> of trying to sow ethnic disorder. `` The leaders of the ... -LRB- group -RRB- provoked an attack on forces of law and order in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>. They tried to instigate a demonstration and spread news of so-called clashes between the Armenian and Azerbaijani populations,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, reported from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that strike organizers were stopping buses to prevent people from going to work. It said 84 people were arrested for violating laws on rallies, marches and demonstrations. In <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, the editor of the Soviet government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should resist strong-arm tactics to settle ethnic disturbances in its south and in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> area. `` There are people who say ` Look, what you have done, now it's time to bang a fist on the table,''' <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laptiev </PERSON> said in an interview in Russian `` But no, we will not go that way.''

<TEXT>
 An American engineer filed a federal damage suit Tuesday against the Saudi Arabian government, claiming Saudi torturers broke his back and legs in 1984 and left him permanently disabled. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, 34, of <PERSON> Davie </PERSON> said he now walks with a cane, has had four knee operations in the past year and was about to enter the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, for up to another year of treatment. `` This suit is going to test our laws,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Tuesday from an apartment he has taken in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` I'm suing them for the damages from the torture I sustained. They broke my back and my legs and never even charged me with a crime.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and other Americans who said they suffered at the hands of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> authorities testified before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee in June 1987. In September 1984 <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> was an engineer for <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, monitoring systems at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital in <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. He told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that police picked him up from the hospital security office after he complained about hospital safety problems, but said that to this day Saudi authorities have never explained his detention. `` I have no idea why,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` In four years of trying to find out, nobody has been able to give me an idea.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said he was held incommunicado and tortured for 39 days. `` They have a unique way of torturing people,'' he said. `` They shackle your hands and feet and make you do deep knee bends over a rod until they hear your knees break.'' The torture and repeated beatings left him with a shattered knee, ruptured disks in his back and partial damage to his sciatic nerve, leaving one leg numb. His knee was so badly damaged an artificial one may have to be implanted to save his leg, which suffers from poor circulation. `` I'm walking now, but I have to use a cane,'' he said. `` I'll always have the cane. Saudi authorities eventually released him, telling him his detention had been a mistake, and offering him increasing amounts of money, he said. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> agents later threatened him and his former attorney when he insisted on pursuing the matter with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The threats are under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he could not comment on any investigation. The suit, filed Tuesday in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> federal court, accused Saudi authorities of negligence, battery, unlawful detainment, wrongful arrest and imprisonment, inhuman torture, disruption of normal family life and mental anguish. It does not specify monetary damages. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said she did not have any immediate reaction to the suit. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s attorney, said the case seeks to apply <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> human rights standards and international law to the court suit, something that has rarely been done in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We expect it to be a ground-breaking suit,'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said. `` Prohibition against torture is fairly accepted worldwide.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> complained that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities were of limited help. He praised <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., who served on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, but said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lost his files after he appeared on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> He said the federal suit against a foreign government in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts represents his best chance to get compensation for the torture and damage he suffered.

 A jury on Tuesday convicted a man of rape in the first trial among 10 men accused in a case in which a woman alleges she was attacked by as many as 23 men outside an illegal cockfight. The jury deliberated about 20 minutes before returning the verdict against <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, 24. The panel also suggested a 20-year prison term. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> showed little reaction when the verdict was read. State District Judge <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> set sentencing Oct. 17. The 19-year-old woman told police <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> and other men forced her to go to a ranch where illegal cockfights were being held near this south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town of about 5,000 people. She said as many as 23 men raped and sodomized her on the roof of a car the night of March 26-27, sometimes two at a time. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, who faces a later trial on an aggravated kidnapping charge, claimed the woman insisted on having sex with him twice outside the cockfight and that they had been having an affair for some time. The victim said the verdict `` was right, because I do n't want him to go and do it to somebody else.'' `` I'm relieved, too, because now it will take off some of the stress and the pain that I had,'' she said in an interview in Corpus Christi Tuesday afternoon. She said she is prepared to testify against the other men accused in the case. Jurors returned the verdict about 4:15 a.m. They then deliberated another 20 minutes before deciding to recommend the maximum sentence for <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> had asked the jury for probation. The judge kept the jurors late because he wanted them to reach a verdict before he left for a judicial conference in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> later Tuesday. A second defendant is to stand trial next month. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said he believes some of the other defendants might want to plea bargain for shorter prison terms if jurors sentence <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> to prison.

Withdrawal is the key to ending hostilities between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and securing independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The latest round of U.S.-mediated talks began in the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> capital Monday.

Although Marxist <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has said the Cubans were needed only to block attacks by South African forces, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> also has been battling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> - and South African-backed guerrillas of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> Lt.

 <PERSON> Yulia </PERSON> <PERSON> Akselrod </PERSON> never knew her grandfather, <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> revolutionary <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>, and she has long rejected his ideas. But she and her family suffered anyway for their lineage, and now she is seeking justice. Mrs. <PERSON> Akselrod </PERSON>, 52, who immigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1979, has written to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> seeking posthumous rehabilitation for her father, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedov </PERSON>, whom she never met. Though he was not a follower of his ostracized father, he was exiled to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, where he died. Heartened in part by the recent rehabilitation of scores of foes of Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Akselrod </PERSON> said in a recent interview that the Soviet government also ought to clear <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>'s name and document his true role in the 1917 revolution <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>, once a leader of the revolution, was expelled from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1929. `` Now, 60 years later, they're trying to decide who was right or who was wrong,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Akselrod </PERSON> said. `` They're trying to do what an archeologist does; brush dust from bones. But they're afraid to brush all the bones, to admit the whole thing was wrong.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Akselrod </PERSON>, a paint chemist living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, asked <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the letter dated March 18 to help establish the exact time and circumstances of her father's death. She said she is seeking information, not compensation. `` Compensation would never cure -LRB- the suffering -RRB-. What could I get, what could I ask for?'' she said. `` I want the historical truth.'' She said she has not received a reply to her letter. The name of <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>, taboo since his denunciation by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, was mentioned publicly for the first time in decades in a speech Nov. 2 by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Earlier this month, the party newspaper Pravda published an article acknowledging <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>'s role in the revolution. <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> helped direct the 1917 coup that brought the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION> to power, served as a deputy to <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and created and commanded the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in a civil war against counterrevolutionaries. <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>, whose real name was <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronshtein </PERSON>, envisioned a `` permament revolution'' that would spread across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But after <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s death in 1924, <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> lost a power struggle to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who preached `` communism in one country.'' <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> was expelled from the party, deported and reviled as a traitor. He left the country with his wife, <PERSON> Natalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedova </PERSON>, and their oldest son, <PERSON> Lyova </PERSON>, an active follower of his father. <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> was assassinated in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1940. Under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, those suspected of being `` Trotskyites'' were hunted down and imprisoned or killed. But <PERSON> Sedov </PERSON>, who had taken his mother's name in an effort to avoid persecution, remained in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` He decided to stay because he had nothing to do with -LRB- <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> -RRB-'' and thought he was safe, Mrs. <PERSON> Akselrod </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Akselrod </PERSON> remembers her mother's glowing accounts of her father as a man talented in science and math but dogged for most of his life by the legacy of his father, with whom he never got along. In 1936, about three months before <PERSON> Yulia </PERSON> was born, <PERSON> Sedov </PERSON> was sent to <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, in one of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s sporadic crackdowns, she said. According to Western historians, <PERSON> Sedov </PERSON> was given work as an engineer in a factory and later died in what Soviet newspapers called an `` accident'' while trying to organize a mass protest. <PERSON> Natalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedova </PERSON> later wrote that she was sure her apolitical son was murdered. When Mrs. <PERSON> Akselrod </PERSON> was nearly 2, her mother, <PERSON> Henrietta </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>, was arrested. <PERSON> Yulia </PERSON> was sent to live with her maternal grandparents in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In 1951, when she was 15, her grandparents were arrested for being `` socially dangerous elements.'' <PERSON> Yulia </PERSON> was sent to an orphanage for three months, then to prison to live with her grandparents for a month. Then she was shipped off to <LOCATION> Kolyma </LOCATION>, a small <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> village, to live with her mother until her graduation from high school, she said. `` Because of my youth, I was never convicted or sentenced,'' she said. <PERSON> Yulia </PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> area in 1954, a year after <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s death, studied chemistry and eventually married, telling only two people of her past `` You can not imagine <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> in these years. Nobody could say that name out loud,'' she said. `` I was scared my whole life.'' Though life improved slightly under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s successors, Mrs. <PERSON> Akselrod </PERSON> said she was determined to leave the country. Finally during detente, with the <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> name still taboo, Mrs. <PERSON> Akselrod </PERSON> emigrated with her husband and son. Her mother died last year in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, at age 77. With no other relatives alive in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Akselrod </PERSON> said she finally felt secure seeking more information about her father's fate as <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>'s son. `` I do not hate him personally. I just hate his ideas,'' she said of <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>. `` This system killed me for 40 years. It is his -LRB- system -RRB- _ his and <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s.''

<HEAD>Farm Conferees Produce Bill Capping Export Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farm lawmakers reached a compromise Tuesday on an agricultural money bill that placed a $ 770 million ceiling on the nation's major export subsidy program in the upcoming fiscal year. Lawmakers are still adding up the items in the massive money bill, which covers everything from farm subsidies to food stamps, but the total was between the $ 44.1 billion <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> level and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 47.3 billion. Under the measure, produced by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>, spending on the Export Enhancement Program would be capped at $ 770 million in the fiscal year starting Saturday. The administration had requested $ 900 million for the program, under which major grain companies and other exporters are paid with surplus crops to spur exports of American farm products. Established under the wide-ranging 1985 farm law, the program has been responsible for stepped up shipments of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat and feedgrains. Sen. <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, R-Miss., had pushed for a larger amount but said the level approved would not put too large a crimp in the program `` I think this is a strong signal that we are at level of export assistance that will ensure that we will be able to sell in the international marketplace anything we have available to sell,'' he said. The committee also put a $ 200 million ceiling on expenditures under the Targeted Export Assistance program, which supplies aid for advertising and other promotion of American agricultural products overseas. The program had been scheduled to increase to $ 325 million a year under the 1985 farm program. It has been criticized in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> recently for providing taxpayer aid for the product's of specific companies. The conferees also adopted a compromise with the administration that would defer for one year a cut in the amount that production credit associations would have to pay to bolster the financially wobbly Farm Credit System. Production credit associations are local lending institutions that are part of the massive, borrower-owned system, which represents the nation's largest farm lender. The associations were required to pay assessments under a federal bailout passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration Monday had called on conferees to drop the provision calling for a lowering of the assessment level, threatening a presidential veto of the entire bill.

 About 10,000 Slav students boycotted high schools Tuesday in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, sources said, and an estimated 80,000 people rallied in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> to protest alleged persecution of Slavs in the southern province. The students joined a school boycott that began in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s provincial capital of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> last Thursday to protest purported harassment by ethnic Albanian classmates, said the sources in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity At the rally in the Serbian city of <LOCATION> Cacak </LOCATION>, 75 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, demonstrators demanded that leaders responsible for the trouble in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> be held accountable, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. `` The people have said what they had to say, now it is up to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the League of Communists -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to take action,'' <PERSON> Bole </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukic </PERSON>, a local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leader, told cheering protesters.

The Slav minority in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s poorest region, claims it is being harassed, intimidated and forced to leave the province by the ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s population Most of the Slavs are Christians. Most Kosovo Albanians are Moslems. The Serbian republic, one of six republics constituting <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, includes <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. Earlier Tuesday, about 3,000 Slav children from <LOCATION> Klina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pec </LOCATION> traveled 30 miles by train to <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, determined to stage a street protest to air their grievances, the sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Also Tuesday, about 200 Slav university professors and students organized a protest meeting at <ORGANIZATION> Pristina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, saying they will not attend classes scheduled to start Oct. 1, the sources said. Fearing ethnic violence, the federal government sent police reinforcements this month to <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. The Albanians there have not reacted to date to a recent spate of protest rallies organized by Serbs and Montenegrins. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s Albanians are descended from <LOCATION> Illyrian </LOCATION> tribes that populated the area from ancient times.

<HEAD>Court Delays Teamsters' Mailing of Ballots on New Auto Transport
Accord</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> to wait five days before mailing out ratification ballots on a newly renegotiated three-year contract covering some 20,000 drivers of auto transport trucks. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the union from mailing the ballots until next Monday after dissident <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> complained that a `` quickie'' vote would preclude them raising a campaign to defeat the accord. The Teamsters had planned to mail out the ballots this Wednesday on a new tentative contract reached with some 30 auto transport companies late last week. An earlier tentative accord reached in July was rejected by 72 percent of the covered members in the union, prompting a reopening of negotiations that resulted in last week's agreement. Both tentative accords provided for yearly 40 cents-an-hour pay increases _ or 2.5 percent annually _ for drivers now making about $ 16 an hour. The agreements also provided total increases of $ 30 a week in employer contributions to jointly administered pension and health funds for each covered worker. The renegotiated pact eliminates `` new business'' concessions included in the earlier accord that had been opposed by rank-and-file members and increases unloading pay in some areas of the country. <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON> issued the order in response to a petition by two <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> members of <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a 10,000-member dissident faction. The petition claimed that the union's plan to mail out the ballots on Wednesday, six days after the new accord was announced, was `` well-calculated to prevent opponents from obtaining enough information about it to disseminate their views to fellow members.'' The <ORGANIZATION> TDU </ORGANIZATION> dissidents had sought a 10-day delay, but an attorney for them claimed victory with <PERSON> Lamberth </PERSON>'s order. `` It's not ideal, but we'll take second best,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, a public interest law firm attorney retained by <ORGANIZATION> TDU </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the ballots had been mailed out tomorrow, we would n't have had time to get our leaflets out.'' The union has set the third week of October for tabulating the ballots.

<HEAD>Expert Disputes Claim That Guerrillas Could Have Detonated Bomb</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An electronics expert said Monday it was impossible for three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members to have set off a radio-controlled bomb from where they were standing when British soldiers, claiming a bombing was imminent, gunned them down. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> electronics engineer, told an inquest that he tested various radio transmissions from the site where the March 6 shootings occurred to a car parked about a mile away. British commandos have claimed that they killed the three <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, who were unarmed, because they feared the guerrillas were about to detonate a radio-controlled bomb in a car parked about a mile away. But <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said even if the guerrillas had tried, `` as an academic, I must say it would n't have happened.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said walls and buildings would have blocked the radio signals. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s testimony came on the 16th day of an inquest by <PERSON> Gibraltar </PERSON> <PERSON> Coroner </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzarello </PERSON> and an 11-man jury into the March 6 shooting deaths of <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 31, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 24. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged the three were on `` active service,'' meaning they were on a mission to strike at British targets at the time of their deaths. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s testimony countered that of a senior British intelligence official and a bomb expert in the elite military <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the squad whose members killed the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. That witness said a bomb could have been detonated by remote control. On Monday, a <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> constable claimed that <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> was reaching into her purse when the soldiers opened fire. Another witness, a <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> resident who had been looking out her apartment window, testified Friday that <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> had been raising her arms in surrender. The inquest has no power of prosecution. Its aim is to determine whether the shootings were lawful. Critics of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government claimed the shootings are evidence of an unofficial `` shoot-to-kill'' policy against members of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. The mostly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite it with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The March 6 killings triggered a renewed round of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attacks on British soldiers.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> courted the middle class on Tuesday with a modest plan to allow small savers to `` put something away for a rainy day'' and defer taxes on the interest. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for providing average Americans with a mere `` 20 bucks a year'' while the rich receive a `` $ 40 billion giveaway.'' The vice president got in the snappiest one-liner of the campaign day when he told an audience at <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> that a current television show `` reminds me of what interest rates might be if the Democrats get back in again. It's called ` thirtysomething.''' The Democrats ridiculed right back. Asked what a <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> administration might look like, Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> laughed and said, `` very exciting.'' Asked later what he meant, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> laughed again and said, `` I'll leave it at that.'' Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> campaigned in <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where he challenged <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to resign his membership in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` Let him today resign from the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>. Let him renounce all their bizarre positions. Let him make clear _ no more waffling and backsliding _ that he no longer supports the outrageous stands that the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> takes,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> rally of Asian-Americans. Speaking before a crowd of several thousand people, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a distinction for the first time about his opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, which he uses as a device to attack <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal because he belongs to the organization. `` I do n't have a quarrel with their work in, you know, helping whatever position they take in terms of defending the right of an individual,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` but I just do n't agree with the major positions that organization has taken'' in terms of legalizing pornography and its opposition to tax exemptions for religious institutions. Meanwhile, a national poll released Tuesday found that perceptions of Sunday's presidential debate as a dead heat have increased, with a plurality of respondents saying there was no clear winner. Forty-two percent in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll conducted Monday night said the debate was a tie or did n't know who won _ more than double the 20 percent who expressed one of those views after the debate Sunday night. The poll of 416 likely voters also found that 34 percent said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won while 24 percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned in the best performance. The survey, which included voters who had not seen the debate but had heard or read about it, had a margin of error of plus or minus six percentage points. The two vice presidential candidates are scheduled to debate on Oct. 5 in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, and the jockeying for advantage already was well under way. Democrats have criticized <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> unsparingly during the campaign, but in an apparent bid to raise expectations about the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator's debate performance, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> characterized him as a skillful debater. `` I think <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is going to do very well in the debate,'' said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator. He said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> loves to debate on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor and `` I'm not so confrontational.'' The vice president upgraded his own self-evaluation in last Sunday night's debate with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I feel better today about the way the debate went than I did the night of the debate.'' He joked about the `` handwringers'' on his staff who feared he would `` massively foul it up.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlined his plan for a tax break for low - and middle-income people in a speech in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> He called the program an individual savings account and said it would help the nation `` gain better control over our long-term economic future'' as well as help savers `` put something away for a rainy day.'' One adviser said the tax deferred on interest the first year on $ 1,000 would save roughly $ 12 for a taxpayer in the 15 percent income tax bracket and slightly more in later years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the plan would allow many Americans to lock up as much as $ 1,000 a year _ in accounts of five years or more _ with federal income tax deferred. When withdrawn, the accumulated interest would be taxed at the saver's income tax rate then in effect. The tax break would be fully available to taxpayers with adjusted gross income of less than $ 50,000 a year. It would gradually phase out until it disappeared for someone with adjusted gross income of $ 60,000. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> officials estimated the program would benefit 8 million Americans, at a cost to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> about $ 70 million in 1989 and $ 550 million by 1993. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed his savings plan after weeks of being criticized by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for an earlier proposal to cut the maximum tax rate on capital gains. Speaking to a crowd in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Melrose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> poked funs at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s program, juxtaposing the savings from the plan against the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee's proposal to cut the capital gains tax. `` Twenty bucks a year _ that's Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s solution for average Americans,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said referring to his campaign's calculation of the plan's financial benefits. `` He says it will make them -LRB- average Americans -RRB-, and here I'm quoting, ` better able to afford a home, pay for college, start a business. Twenty bucks a year, who's he kidding?'' In a statement, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` Today, after I pointed that out to him on Sunday night, he discovered the rest of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and he told just what his priorities are. He wants to give the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans $ 30,000 and the rest of us are going to get twenty bucks. That's a new definition of trickle-down.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> renewed his attack in an appearance in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, calling the capital gains cut a `` five-year, $ 40 billion giveaway to the wealthiest Americans, people making more than $ 200,000 a year.'' The Democrat also depicted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as no friend of Social Security and Medicare who cast a tie-breaking vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> several years ago in favor of a plan to cut cost-of-living increases in federal benefits for retirees. `` The first time <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ran for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> he opposed <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and called it ` socialized medicine,''' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The first time <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ran for president he called Social Security ` basically a welfare program.'''

 Police on Tuesday arrested one of the leaders of last year's bloody attempt to topple President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and said the renegade colonel was recruiting dissident soldiers for a new coup plot. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> district, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Matillano </PERSON> was arrested before dawn in a raid on a hotel in <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after informants reported seeing him dining there. <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Matillano </PERSON>, former constabulary chief in <LOCATION> Nueva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ecija </LOCATION> province, was the `` chief recruiter'' of right-wing military dissidents and had been traveling throughout the country seeking to convert soldiers to his cause. <PERSON> Matillano </PERSON> played a major role in the failed coup on Aug. 28, 1987, that was led by former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, who remains at large. <PERSON> Matillano </PERSON> led an assault on the government television station and a hotel near armed forces headquarters during the attempt, in which at least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded. He was arrested a short time later and was charged with rebellion, but escaped last April during a visit to a dentist. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> was arrested last December but fled a prison ship in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, also in April. <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Matillano </PERSON>'s arrest followed the recent capture of 63 followers of deposed President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. He said those arrests were kept secret for security. He said <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s group apparently forged an alliance with other renegade officers linked to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, adding: `` Matillano's capture severely cripples recent attempts by ultra-rightist elements to destabilize the government.'' Elsewhere, military chief of staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> ordered reinforcements sent to southeastern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> on Tuesday after communist rebels killed 10 soldiers and a civilian in a weekend ambush and captured five sergeants who were carrying a unit payroll worth up to $ 50,000. In another incident, police said Sgt. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Dizon </PERSON> was driving to work in suburban <LOCATION> Malabon </LOCATION> Tuesday when four attackers fired, killing him instantly. Police said the attack was similar to those used by communist rebels, who have killed scores of police and soldiers in the capital this year.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill To Impose Sanctions Against Iraq For Poison Gas
Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> overwhelmingly approved legislation Tuesday imposing sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> as a `` concrete expression of outrage'' over that nation's alleged poison gas attacks against Kurdish villages. The strongly bipartisan vote was 388-16. The legislation goes to conference with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which passed a far more punitive sanctions bill earlier in the month. The House bill would impose sanctions on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in two bites, some to take place immediately and others to go into effect if <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> continues to use poison gas. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposes both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions of the legislation on grounds that they `` would not bring us closer'' to the goal of ending <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of chemical weapons. In debate on the measure, which took place Monday evening, some members said that sanctions would be counterproductive and hurt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business interests. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, R-Minn., said that while <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> apparently has been involved in `` a heinous act,'' economic sanctions are unwise because they hurt `` American employers and American employees. `` I think it is well intentioned but represents imprudent policy,'' <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., replied: `` There comes a time in the life of every nation where you take a strong moral stand, and this is one of those times. `` We must never yield to evil,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, R-Ill. `` It is imperative that the response we give not be one of silence,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>. `` The bill before us is ... the first concrete expression of outrage against the use of chemical weapons <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON> called the sanctions bill `` a measured response.'' The 16 House members voting against the sanctions bill were Reps. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Combest </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, R-Calif.; Glenn English, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, R-Minn.; <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>; <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jontz </PERSON>, D-Ind.; <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, D-Minn.; <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Wis.; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stump </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>.; and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> The 27 House members not voting were Reps. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON>, D-Wash.; <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Mich </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich.; <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON>, R-Pa.;; <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Espy </PERSON>, D-Miss.; <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Flippo </PERSON>, D-Ala.; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, D-Mo; <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastert </PERSON>, R-Ill.; <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heffner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga.; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Delbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leath </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Buddie </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> McCandless </PERSON>, R-Calif.; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McEwen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wortley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>; Under its terms, an immediate ban would be imposed on the export to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of weapons, sensitive high technology, and chemicals used in the production of chemical weapons. If <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> continues to use chemical weapons, the president would be authorized to impose further sanctions from a list included in the bill. These include restricting the import of Iraqi petroleum and other products, restricting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, including agricultural products, denying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial credits and credit guarantees, downgrading diplomatic relations and opposing loans to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> by international lending institutions. The president is authorized to waive the sanctions required and authorized by the bill if he can certify that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is not using chemical weapons and has provided reliable assurances _ such as permitting on-site inspection _ that it will not use chemical weapons in the future. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> softened the restrictions of the bill by permitting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters to continue to sign contracts with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> until the president actually decides to restrict exports. But in a separate action, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation Tuesday that seeks to bar <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from selling its shuttered <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Works steel-making plant to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryder </PERSON> said last week that the deal for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> plant fell through because a letter of intent expired on Sept. 21 without action by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The original language of the sanctions bill would have protected only those contracts signed before Sept. 15.

<TEXT>
 Foreign ministers from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are to resume direct peace talks Saturday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, an official said, the first meeting between the warring nations since peace talks fell apart in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Sept. 13. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and a special mediator plan to meet separately Friday with <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiliani </PERSON>, the secretary-general's spokesman. The two foreign ministers then will have face-to-face negotiations on Saturday with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and the mediator, Ambassador <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Guiliani </PERSON> said Tuesday. The talks, aimed at ending the 8-year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, began in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Aug. 25, five days after a U.N.-sponsored truce took effect. Negotiations bogged down over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s demand that the <LOCATION> Shaat-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, be cleared of sunken ships and silt as the next step in the peace process. Disputes over navigation rights in the waterway was a main cause of the war. A 1975 treaty puts the border down the middle of the passage, but <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is seeking control of the entire waterway. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution outlining an end to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war also calls for the sides to withdraw to internationally recognized borders, an exchange of prisoners of war, and a formal determination of who started the conflict. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> initially endorsed the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution in July 1987, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did not accept it until a year later, after a series of battlefield defeats.

<TEXT>
 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, criticized for advocating tax breaks for the wealthy, proposed a plan Tuesday that would offer tax-deferred interest to low - and middle-income Americans on long-term savings deposits <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said such `` individual savings accounts'' would help the nation `` gain better control over our long-term economic future'' by increasing savings. `` Americans have increasingly gotten away from the sensible frugality that says, ` put some away for a rainy day,''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign criticized the proposal as `` pitching pennies'' at the financial struggles of working families because it amounted to a tax break of 40 cents a week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unveiled the proposal before the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Republican state convention on his second visit to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> in 11 days. The state, offering a prize of 23 electoral votes, is a key battleground in the election fight. In a later appearance across the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> softened his assaults on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which have become part of his attack on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I need to carry <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to win the presidency of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared earlier in the day at a rally before thousands of cheering students at <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. He was headed Wednesday to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, where he will take a bus tour. As described by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the savings plan would allow interest to accumulate tax deferred for funds put on deposit for at least five years. A maximum of $ 1,000 a year could be deposited. When withdrawn, the interest would be taxed at the saver's tax rate then in effect. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economist who advises <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign, offered this example: If a person put $ 1,000 into such an account and if it paid about 8 percent annual interest, that would yield about $ 80 in interest income. For those in the 15 percent tax bracket, that would defer some $ 12 in taxes the first year, slightly more in later years. It would cost the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> about $ 70 million in 1989 if that were the first year in effect, growing to $ 550 million by 1993, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign estimated. The full interest deduction would be available only to taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of less than $ 50,000 a year. Taxpayers with adjusted incomes of $ 60,000 or more would not be eligible for the program. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign staff estimated that more than 8 million Americans would take advantage of the plan. `` They will be helping themselves become better able to afford a home, pay for college or start a business, and they will be helping <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ by increasing investment and economic growth,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been repeatedly attacked by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for advocating a cut in the maximum capital gains tax from its current level of 33 percent down to 15 percent. Most people who pay the tax are charged about 28 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, speaking in a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> savings proposal would yield the average family $ 20 a year. `` Twenty bucks a year, who's he kidding?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Today, after I pointed that out to him on Sunday night, he discovered the rest of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and he told just what his priorities are,'' he said. `` He wants to give the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans $ 30,000 and the rest of us are going to get twenty bucks. That's a new definition of trickle-down.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned later Tuesday at a rally at a riverfront park in <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, after a brief ride on sightseeing boat on the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. When a reporter tried to ask <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about the minimal impact of his savings plan, the question was interrupted and drowned out by the blaring noise of the boat's horn. `` Thank you very much,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, turning away with a smile. Speaking before a crowd of several thousand people, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a distinction for the first time about his opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, which he uses as a device to attack <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal because he belongs to the organization. `` I do n't have a quarrel with their work in, you know, helping whatever position they take in terms of defending the right of an individual,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` but I just do n't agree with the major positions that organization has taken.'' In his <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> avoided any attack on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and tried to set a tone of compassion. `` The answer is up to us,'' he said. `` The answer is in each individual act of kindness multiplied by thousands and tens of thousands. The answer is in a new engagement in the pain of others.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> entertained the students with a series of barbs aimed at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Referring to a television series, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` There's a TV show that reminds me of what interest rates might be if the Democrats get back in again. It's called `` thirtysomething.''

<HEAD>Reports: Captured Beachfront Must Be Returned To Egypt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An international team of arbitrators has ruled that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must return a disputed beachfront resort area to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media reported Tuesday. The ruling, which has been under consideration since May 1987, is to be announced Thursday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>, a beach resort along the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war and retained the property when it returned the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1982. The dispute over the 250-acre area has been a key sticking point in <LOCATION> Egyptian-Israeli </LOCATION> relations. The two countries signed a U.S.-mediated peace treaty in 1979. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio and newspapers said the arbiters, who have visited the site and studied old maps and thousands of documents from both sides, had decided to return all the property to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. A Foreign Ministry official declined comment on the reports but said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> planned to honor whatever decision the arbiters reached. He noted that if <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> were returned to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, some compensation would likely have to be made to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> citizens who own a hotel and a beach resort along the half-mile beachfront. In <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s government was so confident the arbiters will decide in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s favor that the ministry already was preparing a statement to be issued after the announcement. A state-run trave agency in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Misr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has begun advertising trips to the <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> area. `` Now <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> is the talk of the whole world,'' said the advertisement in the English-language Egyptian Gazette. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s hardline <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> clashed over <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>, an issue expected to surface in the elections campaign. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliament elections are scheduled for Nov. 1. The <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> said if the decision goes against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, it would be proof of its contention that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> can not expect a fair hearing from an international body and should not agree to an international conference on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace. `` We should not agree beforehand to the demands of the other side,'' <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio. `` I accuse <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and Labor officials, who threaten that if we do n't accept some demand, everything will collapse.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who favors an international conference, said he still believed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could sign a peace treaty with neighboring <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> without necessarily returning all the territory it occupies, as was the case with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` I'm also not sure we had to reach such a treaty with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. But I supported it because it was the only one in the field,'' he said on the radio in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> is scheduled to meet with his Egyptian counterpart, <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Thursday. The two leaders are expected to work out how to implement the ruling. The five-member <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> arbitration team is made up of Swedish chief arbitrator <PERSON> Gunar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagergren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellet </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Schindler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also captured the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 war.

<TEXT>
 Diplomats at the French Embassy are threatening to strike in a pay dispute, a source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. French Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Monday with representatives of French diplomatic missions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to see whether he could defuse the problem and dispatched an aide to talk to staff in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the source, who refused to be identified. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> diplomats, who had planned to walk out this week, agreed to delay any protest until after French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> makes a one-day visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday. `` It has nothing to do with the visit, and they did n't want to disrupt it,'' said the source who is close to a committee representing staff. <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> reportedly promised to look into the matter. Some 80 percent of the 250 embassy employees in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, ranging from typists to top diplomats, already staged a walkout on Sept. 9, and other diplomatic missions also have been involved in the dispute, the source said. The protest concerns a decision to cut foreign-living allowances by 20 percent for staffers who live in some 90 countries where compensation is based on the value of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, which has been rising against the franc this year. There have been protests in other posts in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and elsewhere, the source said. Besides the embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the French have 12 consulates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, appealing to `` mainstream Americans,'' assailed <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday as an enemy of Social Security and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> who might cut both programs. The Democratic presidential nominee traveled to the city that has become a symbol of middle <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to combat his Republican rival's suggestion that he is outside the nation's mainstream. `` If you want to see the difference between <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and me on the things that concern mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, look at where we stand on Social Security and Medicare,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a rally outside <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>'s city hall. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had called the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> health plan `` socialized medicine'' while running for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> years ago, and that in 1980, while a presidential candidate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called Social Security `` basically a welfare program.'' `` When it comes to Social Security and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, do n't read his lips, read his record,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a remark that turned around <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` read my lips'' declaration he would not raise taxes. `` He was wrong then and he's wrong now,'' the Democrat said. Later, during a speech in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Melrose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> riduled a proposal made Tuesday by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to allow small savers to sock away up to $ 1,000 a year and defer paying taxes on the interest. `` Twenty bucks a year _ that's Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s solution for average Americans,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said referring to his campaign's calculation of the benefits from the plan, `` He says it will make them, and here I'm quoting, ` better able to afford a home, pay for college, start a business,''' he said. `` Twenty bucks a year, who's he kidding? `` Today, after I pointed that out to him on Sunday night, he discovered the rest of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and he told just what his priorities are. He wants to give the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans $ 30,000 and the rest of us are going to get twenty bucks. That's a new difinition of trickle-down.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> fell on his face when he tripped while climbing stairs to the stage at the Melrose Park event. He got up, showed no sign of being injured or upset, and shrugged it off when asked about it later. `` It happens in every campaign at least once,'' he said. While there he was presented with a shirt bearing the name <ORGANIZATION> Eureka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> school that is President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s alma mater. On the back were the words, `` We like Dutch but we love the Duke.'' Seeking to encourage the notion that he had tightened the presidential race with a strong debate performance two days earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> escalated his assault on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s views on Social Security and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor repeatedly referred to his debate performance, asking the <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> crowd `` How many of you thought I won?'' and drawing a thunderous cheer. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` said our family farms must be doing just fine'' in the debate. `` He must be kidding,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, saying there were 200,000 family farms and half a million farm-related manufacturing jobs lost in eight years. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said both Social Security and Medicare were likely targets for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to cut to finance additional defense spending and to offset a cut in the tax on capital gains, a tax break <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> contended would primarily benefit the wealthy. He recalled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tie-breaking <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote to cut cost-of-living increases for Social Security, and repeated his suggestion that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might tap the Social Security trust fund. `` Now, if Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants another tax give-away for the rich, and if he ca n't think of a single weapons system in the budget that he opposes ... and if he says he's going to bring down the deficit, then how's he going to do it without raiding the Social Security trust fund and trying to cut Social Security and Medicare again?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` My friends,'' he added, `` Social Security is not a ` welfare program.' Social Security is a contract between generations, and ... I will never break that contract.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, a tossup industrial state, a day before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was taking an eight-hour bus trip across the state. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared with former Democratic rival Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, the city recalled in political memory for the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration's reference to it as a barometer of middle <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 Officials running a police training school Tuesday defended an exercise session that hospitalized 16 cadets, including one who required a liver transplant. The cadets were treated at hospitals beginning Sept. 19, the first day of classes, with ailments ranging from exhaustion and dehydration to kidney failure. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said no cadet was denied water during the training and that activity on the first day was no more strenuous than any other group's first day at an academy. `` There was strenuous physical activities, as there always was on that first day ... -LRB- but -RRB- we have found no one that was denied water upon request,'' <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> said at a news conference. The most seriously ill cadet, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, 25, a <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION> police trainee, collapsed while running on the track and has been in a coma for a week. He received a liver transplant early Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian-University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and remained in critical condition. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION>, who quit the <ORGANIZATION> Edward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> after one day, said recruits were required to exercise vigorously and were kept moving with pushups and laps if they failed to respond quickly to orders. `` We started at 7:30 a.m. with a formation with our gear _ our jackets, boots and other stuff in a duffel bag weighing 50 to 60 pounds _ and we had to walk to classes carrying the duffel bag above our heads with one arm,'' he said. `` We also moved metal lockers and heavy wood furniture from the basement up to either the second or third floor of the building,'' he said. `` Everybody was pushed to the limit before we even got to the physical training part.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>, the state's chief epidemiologist, said the cadets who became ill at the training facility in <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION> suffered from dehydration and exhaustion. Law enforcement officials said they would investigate training routines at <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> police academies. Nearly three dozen police chiefs from western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> have asked the state attorney general to have an independent agency investigate the academy. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON>, chairman of the training council, said the council, the state attorney's general office and state police would investigate training procedures in the academies. `` Hopefully the council's mission will be to correct this so it wo n't occur in the future,'' <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> said, `` We feel at this time that the cause of illness was a relatively insufficient intake of water relative to the amount of exercise they were doing.'' The Executive Office of Public Safety oversees the council, which certifies the state's 12 police academies. <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> said that `` stressful situations'' are often introduced as part of the training to see if any of the cadets may react improperly. `` We'd rather have them do it in the academy than out in the streets,'' <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> said. Asked if it was the cadets who were at fault for not drinking enough water, <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> replied, `` Some of them were unaware of the fact that they were doing damage to themselves. They had a chance to go home every night to rehydrate.'' Several stricken cadets told reporters that they could not comment on their experiences at the training facility without permission from their supervisors. But one former cadet said the training routine was severe and that trainees were allowed only two cups of water before <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> collapsed. `` I've been through basic training in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and it was twice as bad as that,'' said <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON>. `` The doctors told me that if I had gone back for a second day, I could have suffered permanent kidney damage.'' A spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Baystate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springfield </ORGANIZATION> hospital said that <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> also suffered kidney problems and several of the other cadets received kidney dialysis treatment. Six remained hospitalized. After cadets were urged to seek medical examinations, 21 were found to exhibit symptoms from fatigue and nausea to kidney failure. Dr. <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Lentz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> said Tuesday that she treated three to eight <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION> cadets suffering from fatigue and kidney problems after their first day at the academy in 1984. `` I wish in retrospect that I had pushed harder for them to protest the severity of their training,'' she said.

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> business leaders Tuesday that with Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the helm, the American economy would sail into `` the <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> Triangle of debt, deficit and dependence.'' The Democratic vice presidential candidate said he and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were tough, experienced economic managers who would tackle <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade and budget deficits and _ unlike <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ would strictly enforce the new trade law aimed at opening up foreign markets to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> products. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator began a four-day campaign swing with a visit to this key industrial state, where public opinion polls have shown a close race between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 20 electoral votes at stake. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and I both have a long record of success when it comes to dealing with the economy,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> took a state that was an economic basket case and turned it around. ... As a businessman, as a senator and as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> I have made it a point to look for honest, bipartisan effective answers to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economic problems.'' He touted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' call for expanded public-private partnerships and said promised an activist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> president willing to listen closely to the needs of business and industry. By contrast, he said, the Reagan-Bush administration has stood idly while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lost its edge in research and development of new products and deficits piled up, leaving the nation reliant on foreign bankers to finance its debt. From <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, where he criticized <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for leading the unsuccessful opposition to a law giving workers 60 days' notice before they are laid off. `` But <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> lost the fight against plant closing and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people won,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told an airport crowd of about 250. `` We're going to open the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> season a little early this year.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also applauded <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' performance in his Sunday debate with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` He finally got <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> out of that flag factory and talking about the issues,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was spending the remainder of night preparing for the debate next week in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb. He had several briefing books with him. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> business leaders that since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office eight years ago, the federal budget deficit has nearly tripled, the trade defict has grown to nearly a half-trillion dollars and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been transformed from the largest lending nation to the largest debtor nation. `` Those are the facts and as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has suggested, facts are stubborn things,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` To me and to <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the facts suggest that staying the course, putting this country on automatic pilot, is not an acceptable thing. Not when the course leads to the <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> Triangle of debt, deficit and dependence.'' He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has been `` putting out the word that if <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wins this election you wo n't see any change, they're not going to provide rigorous enforcement of that trade bill ...'' <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: `` That would be a disaster for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ and no city knows it better than <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>.'' Tailoring part of his speech to blue-collar workers, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said income in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> has grown slower than the national average and domestic car production has fallen during the economic recovery that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> brags about. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is to visit President <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s birthplace at Independence, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday and deliver a speech that aides said would compare his credentials for the vice presidency with those of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 41, an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator.

 Hospital authorities on Tuesday reported the first three deaths of Palestinians from the army's newly introduced plastic bullets, which have stirred controversy and drawn a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> protest. The army confirmed the deaths, all in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, but said in all three cases it still was checking to determine the cause of death. The Palestinian hospital officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, have proven reliable in the past in providing information on Palestinian casualties. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> on Tuesday defended plastic bullets as a useful tool in dealing with violence in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and acknowledged they could increase casualties. `` The plastic bullet is intended to hit stone throwers, organizers and inciters of demonstrations, outside the range of the rock,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told a news conference at a military camp in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION>, about 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` The fact that there are more casualties among the rioters for the same number of disturbances _ that is exactly our aim.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s comments indicated a change in the army's firing rules. Soldiers previously could not fire tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters unless their lives were threatened. In a life-threatening situation, the soldiers could use regular lead bullets. These were the deaths blamed by hospital officials on plastic bullets: _ <LOCATION> Osama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braikah </LOCATION>, 17, of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> refugee camp, died after a plastic bullet pierced his heart Tuesday during a clash with troops in the camp, said an official at nearby <LOCATION> Nasser </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> An army official confirmed the death but said he did not know if a plastic bullet was the cause. He acknowledged plastic bullets were used to break up a stone-throwing mob Tuesday at <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>. _ <PERSON> Aiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharar </PERSON>, 17, died in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Nuseirat refugee camp after soldiers shot him in the chest Tuesday with a plastic bullet, hospital officials said The army confirmed the death and said plastic bullets were probably used in Nuseirat, but that it could not give the exact cause of death. _ <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanoun </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, died Monday after he was hit in the chest by a plastic bullet, doctors at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said The army confirmed <PERSON> Zanoun </PERSON>'s death and said it was checking whether he was shot by a plastic or a standard lead bullet. A fourth shooting death was reported Tuesday, but officials could not say whether <PERSON> Hussam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gharbawi </PERSON> died from a plastic bullet or lead bullet. <PERSON> Gharbawi </PERSON> was wounded in clashes in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> Monday and died Tuesday in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, the army and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The deaths raised to 278 the number of Palestinians killed since their uprising began on Dec. 8. Six Israelis also have died. On Tuesday, at least 26 Palestinians were wounded in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in the occupied lands, hospitals reported. The army said two injuries were confirmed and other reports were being checked. The latest casualties followed an upsurge of violence in the occupied lands Monday that left two other Palestinians dead and at least 67 wounded. The violence accompanied a general strike in the territories to protest Israeli imprisonment of Palestinians. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> took the territories from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The plastic bullet has greater range and impact than rubber. Its introduction last month sent <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> casualties soaring and drew calls for limiting its use. The U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which aids Palestinian refugees, protested to the army, noting that woundings in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> alone jumped from 19 in July to 130 in the first 25 days of September. A senior <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said casualties `` have risen to an unacceptable level'' and that growing use of plastic and lead bullets `` can not be justified.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said his job was to reduce violence _ `` Other protests, with all due respects, are of secondary importance to me.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said snipers fired plastic bullets after troops first fired in the air. `` In several cases, the use of plastic bullets in an improper manner and against the orders has caused fatalities,'' it said, without elaborating. An army spokesman said standing orders were that plastic bullets were fired only by specially trained officers and aimed at the legs, but he could not confirm the procedure was fulfilled in every case. Dr. <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Artin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ahli </PERSON> <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> said in an interview that plastic bullets tended to do less damage than lead bullets but could kill. `` They can kill if they hit the chest, abdomen or neck,'' he said. `` If they hit a nerve, they can paralyze.'' He said he treated several patients with wounds to the central body. `` One patient took six plastic bullets, one in the abdomen,'' <PERSON> Artin </PERSON> said.

 Four advocates for homeless rights were arrested Tuesday night when they refused to leave the <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> office of Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The two men and two women, charged with unlawful entry, were among eight <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> homeless-rights advocates who staged an all-day sit-in at the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat's office in an attempt to force the congressman to endorse a $ 20 billion housing bill. The bill, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., would provide 7.5 million units of affordable housing It rivals <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s proposed Community Housing Partnership Act, which would allocate $ 500 million in federal matching funds to non-profit affordable housing projects After meeting with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in his office, eight demonstrators said they would stay put until the congressman pledged to support <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s bill. The group had been protesting inside <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s office since 11 a.m. and four refused to leave when asked by the congressman's staff, said Capitol police officer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said they are scheduled to be arraigned in <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday.

 A new <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> launch directorate met Tuesday to clear the shuttle Discovery for its Thursday liftoff, hearing an `` excellent review'' of the $ 1.5 billion spacecraft's readiness _ but holding off giving a go-ahead for the final countdown `` In general, the whole picture is very good for going flying the day after tomorrow,'' said former astronaut <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, who heads the launch oversight panel created to overcome management problems that contributed to the 1986 Challenger disaster. <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> said the group was focusing on two items and needed to be certain neither would imperil <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s first manned mission in 32 months. Launch is scheduled for 9:59 a.m. EDT on Thursday, with the final countdown to begin early Wednesday evening. `` The weather is probably the biggest question mark,'' said <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>. Cloud-covered skies and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> winds loomed, as always, as a possible threat. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeman </PERSON> forecast `` a 20 percent probability of bad weather at launch time,'' but added, `` That's pretty low.'' Historically, launches have been delayed 40 percent of the time because of weather. The outlook did n't brighten much late in the day. Weathermen still were predicting widely scattered showers in the area. Discovery's five astronauts went over their flight plan and relaxed with their wives as the ship sat surrounded by work platforms on launch pad 39B. Heat shields, removed for engine check-out, were back in place and engineers checked guidance and navigation systems. Inside the cargo bay: the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> TDRS </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to be placed in orbit just six hours after launch. A similar satellite was destroyed in the Challenger catastrophe. One of the hardware items still in question was an O-ring in the satellite propulsion system. The other involved a small jet thruster aboard the orbiter itself _ a component that could be bypassed if need be. The $ 100 million data-relay satellite had already been approved for flight when <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> discovered a problem with similar hardware being prepared for flight next February. <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> said an examination of the inertial upper stage -LRB- IUS -RRB- rocket that boosts the satellite to its final orbit indicated damage in the O-ring that seals the pressure needed to gain thrust for orbit. -LRB- The O-ring is not the same part that failed in leading to the 1986 Challenger disaster. -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> needed to be certain the flaw was not replicated aboard Discovery, <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beebe </PERSON> said experts believed the O-ring was `` damaged as part of the installation procedures,'' and so the problem would not also exist on the satellite aboard Discovery. <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> said the shuttle cargo bay would not be opened for inspection of the satellite, but that propulsion experts would conduct tests overnight on other such rockets to make sure they do n't leak. `` You have heard they have a great deal of confidence they'll be able to come in and tell us tomorrow that they think they are prepared to fly,'' <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> said. The report was due at another meeting of the oversight team at 10 a.m. Delivery of the satellite is Discovery's main mission in <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s long-awaited return to space, and the space agency would not likely launch without being sure there was no problem The shuttle fleet has been grounded since Jan. 28, 1986, when a booster rocket failure destroyed Challenger and took the lives of seven astronauts. Many <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> workers were wearing green ribbons on their workclothes this week to signify their hopes for a safe liftoff and successful mission. A `` lightning alert'' delayed the final preparation of Discovery's power-producing fuel cells Tuesday morning, but the countdown was not affected. The countdown was to enter a 19-hour hold at midnight, a cushion that gives <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> time for testing the satellite O-ring. Commander <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>. Covey were up at dawn Tuesday, practicing landings on the Kennedy Space Center runway in an aircraft that handles like a shuttle. The three-mile runway would be used if a launching problem forced the shuttle to return home. At the <ORGANIZATION> Launch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, engineers were checking electronic readings from the ship, 4.2 miles distant. At 1:40 a.m. EDT Thursday, a half-million gallons of super-cold fuel will pour into the shuttle's tanks, aiming for the nationally televised liftoff. The 21-person launch oversight team consists of top officials from each of 17 units responsible for shuttle procedures or components. In their first meeting ever, they gathered Tuesday to air any problems that might surface. The <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which investigated the Challenger accident, found that engineers' opposition to launching in cold weather never reached the ears of key <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> launch officials <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, one of several former astronauts who have moved into key shuttle management posts since the accident, heads the unit and has sole authority to stop a launch. The launch directorate is on call all through the final 48 hours. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON> reviewed countdown and flight procedures and underwent physical examinations. They also received a weather briefing. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s rules, tightened since Challenger, forbid launching when there is lightning or rain within 10 miles of the pad. Winds of more than 17 knots -LRB- about 20 mph -RRB- from the south or 24 knots -LRB- 28 mph -RRB- from any direction would automatically scrub the liftoff.

In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, a government official said 26 activists arrested last week were planning to overthrow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> under a U.S.-devised plot. The Noriega-controlled <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s chief executive in February, after ousting President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Devalle </PERSON>.

The purpose of the attack is to overthrow the government and impose another `` committed to renegotiation'' of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaty, he said. Under provisions of that treaty, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to relinquish operational control over the canal on Dec. 31, 1999.

<TEXT>
 Marines who were called in to help fight fires in Yellowstone National Park this summer began leaving Tuesday, and officials expressed concern that gusting winds might whip flames across containment lines. An approaching cold front increased wind speeds at the park Tuesday afternoon. `` With the winds, there's always concerns about fire activity,'' said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. One area on the 107,500-acre <LOCATION> Wolf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> fire that firefighters worried about was along the western edge of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. `` They're watching for spots on the other side because the eastern slope of the canyon is heavily timbered,'' said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` So they obviously do not want the fire in that area because of the potential for spreading.'' Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, little activity was reported on the 400,100-acre North Fork fire that earlier this month swept around the Old Faithful Geyser complex. Although fire managers were concerned about the strong winds, they said higher humidity levels would help keep the flames in check. `` There were a few hot spots in the <LOCATION> Mary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> area, and they had firefighters camping out last night at spike camps,'' said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` But today all firefighters have been brought into the base camps because of the wind and cold weather.'' Still, conditions improved enough in the past few days to allow 640 Marines to pack up their gear for the return trip to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. About 500 civilian firefighters remained. Officials estimate that since the fires began, as much as 60 percent of an area covering more than 1.6 million acres of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and surrounding national forests has been burned. To the east of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, firefighters were attacking a section of the 413,410-acre Clover-Mist fire that Monday had slopped over the border into <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. `` They've pulled most of the crews from the mop-up effort -LRB- elsewhere on the Clover-Mist -RRB- to try to corral that fire,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>.

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said Tuesday that the pullout of more than 100,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has been suspended because of alleged violations of a U.N.-negotiated accord. In a speech earlier Tuesday to the 43rd <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> proposed that the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meet to discuss violations of the withdrawal agreement. `` As soon as Soviet troops began to withdraw, a non-stop production line of violations was set in motion,'' he said. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> later told reporters the Soviets have suspended their pullout. `` We have completed the first stage of our withdrawal,'' he said, speaking through a translator in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> building hallway. `` We have not yet begun the second stage of withdrawal. Let's wait and see, and I raised several question in my speech today It is necessary to stop the violations that take place. It is the most important thing,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has filed numerous complaints to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> alleging that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is allowing U.S.-backed guerrillas to continue launching raids into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> from bases in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` This can not be allowed to happen. The chain of conflict settlement generated by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> must not be allowed to break,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. `` We're not complaining to anyone. We have the means to make things fall into place. But we are responsible to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, and therefore are appealing to it,'' he said. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to replace one Marxist government with another. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has supplied arms to Moslem troops fighting the Marxist government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. Under the accords signed April 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to withdraw half of its 100,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Aug. 15 and the remainder by Feb. 15, 1989. The agreement was signed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the Afghan government. The guerrillas were not party to the talks.

<HEAD>Charges Filed Against Man Claiming Mouse In Beer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state has filed product tampering and extortion charges against an unemployed construction worker who claimed he found a 6-inch-long decomposed mouse in a can of Coors beer. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, 30, claimed he found the mouse July 27. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, who sought between $ 30,000 and $ 50,000 from the brewery as compensation, refused a $ 1,500 offer from The <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for the can and the mouse. Separate court-ordered studies at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, including an examination of the dead mouse, concluded the animal was placed inside the 16-ounce can after it left the brewery in May. `` We're alleging extortion,'' said <PERSON> McRae </PERSON>. `` It certainly had to do with allegations of communications with The <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to seek $ 35,000 out of this transaction.'' Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McRae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> said the Coors case is similar to the Tylenol-tampering case a few years ago in terms of public reaction. He added that the case may be the first filed under a statute passed in July 1987 that strengthened penalties for tampering with a product to injure a person or company. <PERSON> McRae </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> officials reported a 16 percent loss of sales nationwide since news reports about <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s allegations. Coors spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said Tuesday that the figure was lower but would not give an exact number. Authorities believe <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> has left <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Duval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> <PERSON> Olliff </PERSON> set bond of $ 50,000. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> could face up to 15 years in prison for each of the second-degree felony charges if convicted.

 The first U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker to sail without a close escort of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships left <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> Tuesday, heading south through waters where three mines have been discovered in the past five days. Although traveling alone, the 81,283-ton oil products carrier <LOCATION> Surf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> would not be unprotected should trouble arise, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources said. `` She's on her way, and will be under surveillance at all times,'' said one source, insisting on anonymity. Attacks on commercial shipping stopped Aug. 20 when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> declared a cease-fire in their 8-year-old war. However, fears of mines were heightened with reports that Italian mine-hunters found an explosive device floating in the south-central <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> _ the third such discovery in five days and the fifth since Aug. 19. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is considered responsible for virtually all gulf mines. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s navy commander said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s territorial waters in the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> gulf </LOCATION> are cleared of mines, as are major parts of the international waters, the official <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> news agency reported in a dispatch monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted Rear Adm. <PERSON> Mohammed-Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Malekzadegan </PERSON> as saying an Iranian warship and two guided missile boats arrived in the northern gulf ports of Imam <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mahshahr </PERSON> after clearing the shipping channels in <LOCATION> Khur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Musa </LOCATION> of mines. <PERSON> Khur </PERSON> <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> is the extended bay leading to the two ports. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval experts estimate that about 200 mines remain in the gulf. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships were to monitor the <LOCATION> Surf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s two-day passage from patrol stations along the 550-mile track through the gulf and the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. The missile frigate USS <PERSON> Vandegrift </PERSON> trailed the tanker at a distance, but for the first time no warship was sailing in `` close convoy'' with it, the sources said. The unescorted voyage reflected President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision, announced Monday, to scale back the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s role in the escort program. The close-quarter convoy operation formally ended Monday, when the USS <PERSON> Vandegrift </PERSON> delivered the 294,739-ton supertanker <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> after escorting it through the gulf. That movement was the 67th this year and the 89th since July 1987, when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> agreed to reflag 11 Kuwait-owned tankers to protect them from Iranian attack. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say its first ocean convoy operation since World War II proved successful by assuring the export of billions of barrels of Kuwaiti petroleum products. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats and officials say it also forestalled Soviet efforts to gain greater influence in the waterway that provides nearly 20 percent of the non-communist world's petroleum. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s support for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> made its shipping a special target of Iranian gunboats during attacks. The White House said reduced tensions made possible the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s reduced role. Administration officials say the new policy might allow the withdrawal of one ship. The 26-member fleet now includes 16 in the gulf and a carrier battle group in the Arabian Sea. The missile cruiser USS <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was withdrawn earlier this month and was not replaced. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> also has curtailed air patrols and other escort activities. That cost had been estimated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials at $ 20 million a month. Nine Americans were killed in helicopter and jet crashes during the operation. Other incidents included the mining of the supertanker <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION> in the first convoy July 24, 1987, an Iranian Silkworm missile attack that disabled the tanker <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, and the near-sinking of the frigate USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> by a mine April 14. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces retaliated, wrecking two oil platforms and sinking or damaging six Iranian naval craft in an attack April 18. On July 3, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> mistook an Iranian jetliner for an attacking military jet and shot it down, killing all 290 aboard.

 A six-story apartment building on a steep hillside collapsed Tuesday, killing a man and his baby son and leaving at least four people trapped in the rubble, officials said. Authorities said the building may have been weakened by Hurricane Gilbert, which hit this northern industrial city on Sept. 17 and caused widespread flooding that killed at least 140 people in the area. At least four people were rescued after the collapse, said state prosecutor <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>. A woman, her clothes torn and covered with blood, was pulled from the debris. She told rescuers someone else was trapped there. As she was carried away on a wooden stretcher a man ran up, took off his shirt and said: `` Here my daughter, take this.'' <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, the attorney general of <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, identified the woman as <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugenia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, about 26, wife of the man who died and mother of the dead baby. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said at least four people were believed still inside the building. Earlier, he said five people were believed trapped, but officials later determined that the sixth floor had been empty when the building collapsed. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> reported that he called off all but 10 of the 100 rescuers at 1:30 p.m. because of dangerously shifting rubble. `` The movement could be dangerous for those who are alive,'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said. `` We are trying to approach it more technically.'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> identified the dead man as <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 25 to 30 years old, and said he did not know the name of the baby boy. The lower floors of the 3-year-old building pancaked atop one another but the top three levels slid about 250 feet down the hillside. The rubble stood about one story high, with mattresses, clothing, furniture and crushed air conditioners half buried. The building, in a wealthy area of the city, was one of the highest structures in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakashima </PERSON>, an investigator with the state judicial police, said heavy rains from Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> must have contributed to the collapse. He said the structure was reported leaning to one side six months ago. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 27, who was in his second floor apartment at the time, said he did n't realize what was happening until the building was falling. `` I woke up and the roof was on top of me,'' he said at the scene. He said his maid apparently still was trapped inside the builidng. His face and pink T-shirt were covered with blood and a bandage covered his chin.

 Young Vietnamese immigrants robbing homes and businesses are part of a growing wave of gang violence up and down the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, authorities say. One gang police broke up last year had robbed as many as 50 Vietnamese families, and even more violent groups have since emerged, Detective <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. `` These are brand-new, newly identified, never-before-heard-of Vietnamese gangs. It's going to be a continuing problem,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. `` It's the same thing as last year, but they're getting more violent now. They're pistol-whipping people.'' The Vietnamese gangs are emerging at a time when <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> authorities already have a full-time war on their hands against well-established Hispanic and black gangs. Gang violence over the weekend claimed the lives of four people and left seven others wounded, including two pregnant women. The Vietnamese robbers range in age from 15 to 25 and usually are either runaways or juvenile parolees or delinquents on probation, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. In a June 23 Vietnamese gang attack, 30-year-old Thang Vo survived several gunshot wounds. His assailant and three other robbers tied up a wounded <PERSON> Vo </PERSON>, his wife, brother-in-law and a family friend, while <PERSON> Vo </PERSON>'s three young children were left untied. The robbers, known to police as `` Dracula's Group,'' then sat down to eat lunch in Vo's kitchen. `` They ate lunch while -LRB- Vo -RRB- was lying there bleeding,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. `` He's lucky he lived.'' Another Los Angeles-based group of <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> immigrants is suspected of committing at least a dozen robberies, from here to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, police said. `` We've got so much activity with these guys now that it's hard to even track it anymore,'' said <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>. A continuing problem in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> is a reluctance of victims to report crimes out of fear of retaliation, <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> said.

 State health officials declared Tuesday that it is safe for hundreds of former residents to return to <LOCATION> Love </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, the neighborhood that became world famous for chemical contamination. State Health Commissioner Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> said most areas of Love Canal contain no more chemicals than other neighborhoods in the industrial city. The long-awaited finding was hailed by <LOCATION> Love </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> residents who feared that the neighborhood would not be resettled but would be left vacant as a symbol of environmental disaster. `` We've been waiting for this for 10 years,'' said <PERSON> Nunzio </PERSON> <PERSON> LoVerdi </PERSON>, who lived in a housing project in Love Canal. `` I'll be the first to move back.'' Former resident <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, who heads a Washington-based environmental group, pointed out, however, that the state had not removed all the chemicals dumped in the area in the 1940s, but had merely contained the hazard and cleaned up some residential areas. As part of the state ruling, a task force of local officials will create a plan to resettle the community and assist homeowners in renovating their homes, many of which have fallen into disrepair. Hundreds of families had been awaiting the decision to determine whether they can return to the homes they left 10 years ago when President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> declared the area a national disastr. As many as 80 other families were hoping the study would confirm their decision to stay in their homes near the former chemical dumpsite. Niagara Falls Mayor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Laughlin </PERSON> said the decision will be good for the city. `` It wo n't mean a landslide of people moving back,'' <PERSON> O'Laughlin </PERSON> said. `` But it will mean the city will begin to put the nightmare behind it.'' <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> met with some 200 residents of the area Tuesday night to announce his findings. At first, residents were angry and frustrated at not being able understand <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON>'s technical presentation. But the mood lightened as it became clear that most residents were getting good news. <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> recommended, however, that some blocks were still unsafe, affecting about 10 families. `` I wo n't move. He can just forget it,'' said one of the residents, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>. She said her home had been tested before and found to be free of chemicals. <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> said some homes in areas deemed unsafe may have been found to be free of high levels of contamination, but residents still should move because the surrounding areas had higher concentrations of chemicals. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Slocum </PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said that people such as <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> may be allowed to move into other homes in the neighborhood. The go-ahead for resettlement will add to a revitalization under way in the area. <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Festor </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Niagara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>, said the city is having a real estate boom. `` The decision has been so long in coming that, for most people, it does n't matter anymore,'' Ms. <PERSON> Festor </PERSON> said. Home prices in the Love Canal area have risen in each of the last three years from an average of $ 35,000 to $ 40,000, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Festor </PERSON>, who lives two blocks from Love Canal, said people are n't frightened by the prospect of living near the site. `` It's a secure area with nice homes that are just right for people starting out,'' she said. Love Canal, an abandoned waterway project, was used by the <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to dispose of thousand of pounds of chemical wastes in the 1940s. The company made herbicides and pesticides. In the 1950s, the canal and its contents were covered over and homes and an elementary school built. It was n't until the early 1970s that people began to notice foul smells in their basements and oily puddles in their yards. They also began to notice higher-than-usual incidences of miscarriages, birth defects, cancer, leukemia, neurological disease, allergies, epilepsy and suicide. In all, 728 homes in a 50-block area were evacuated and the elementary school and 228 houses torn down. The state and federal government filed multimillion-dollar suits against the company's parent, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Much of that litigation is still pending The dumpsite has been fenced off and surrounded with clay and plastic liners to prevent the chemicals from leaking into the air or groundwater. Corroding drums of chemicals have been separated and complex runoff and monitoring systems built. Most homes in the immediate area of the dumpsite are boarded up and decaying.

 A politically minded pilot crash-landed a small plane in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> on Tuesday, a short time after radical pamphlets were dropped from a plane buzzing <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, officials said. `` I've got political news: There's more people to vote for than just -LRB- presidential candidates <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and -LRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said student pilot <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>, as police took him into custody. Police did not say if <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> was licensed to fly solo. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> was arrested for investigation of stealing the single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Bellanca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citavria </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> as he tried to run away from the crash site with a backpack full of revolutionary tracts, police reported. The airplane, which had the name `` Nasty Nancy'' and anti-Reagan administration slogans painted on it, was not damaged except for a bent propeller, said Officer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> investigators examined the plane and found that it had fuel in it and no apparent engine defects. `` It kind of points to the fact he did it on purpose,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. A small plane dropped radical pamphlets as it flew over <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> about 10:15 a.m., said prison Lt. <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. The same plane is believed to have then buzzed the <LOCATION> Haight-Ashbury </LOCATION> district in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, just two miles from the landing site, police said. No one was injured in the landing about 10:15 a.m. at the park's <LOCATION> Polo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, where gardeners were working and joggers were making their morning runs <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> police said the plane had been reported stolen earlier in the day from the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Senkir </PERSON>. The plane, the type that normally is used for acrobatic purposes, was registered to <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records. The <PERSON> Johnsons </PERSON> did not return telephone calls for comment. The pilot, carrying a backpack of revolutionary pamphlets, was about halfway back to the <PERSON> Haight </PERSON> on foot when officers in a truck apprehended him. `` It was material about wanting to get <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' police said. The plane also had `` The A-Team'' painted on it along with slogans urging the release of prisoners of war from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Skulls wearing green berets were painted on both sides of the plane and the words `` Pilot: Capt. Crunch'' were scrawled on one door.

 The nation's welfare system is headed for a major overhaul with the conclusion of complex negotiations on a five-year plan aimed at moving welfare recipients into jobs and helping them collect more child support. The initiative agreed on Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators had been close to death all summer as negotiators sought a balance between conservatives favoring mandatory work and liberals concerned about increasing benefits to the needy and motivating people to enter the mainstream workplace. The $ 3.34 billion welfare plan comes in above the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s own $ 2.8 billion measure but would cost less than half of the initial $ 7.1 billion plan passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The cornerstone of the compromise is a Job Opportunities and Basic Skills -LRB- JOBS -RRB- program offering welfare parents _ including those with preschool children _ services such as job search help, education and job training. Child care and transportation aid would be available to participants.

Corn and soybean harvests are proceeding at a record pace in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> as farmers try to prevent further damage to crops that survived the drought, and conservationists said Tuesday they are concerned that will accelerate the schedule of fall tilling and other field work. `` There's a definite correlation between plowing or tilling in the fall and moisture loss,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulliford </PERSON>, director of the Soil Conservation Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. `` The best way to conserve that moisture is not to till.''

<HEAD>Foreign Submarines Still Elude Swedish Hunters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE HMS STOCKHOLM, Baltic Sea off Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Swedish navy ships are constantly on the hunt for alien submarines in the Baltic, but the intruders just as constantly elude them in a maze of islands and underwater mountains. `` It's like fox hunting,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> Lennart </PERSON> <PERSON> Danielsson </PERSON>, skipper of this flagship for <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s antisubmarine warfare unit. `` You have to stretch him, to be after him all the time so that at last he's so tired that he makes a mistake,'' So far the fox has escaped, but the hunters say they are getting closer. The navy believes that during a three-week chase in June a prowler may have been wounded under a barrage of depth charges and anti-submarine grenades, but the vessel slipped away. `` We almost managed this spring,'' said <PERSON> Danielsson </PERSON> on the bridge of the <ORGANIZATION> HMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> during a training exercise. `` I think we will get him in a couple of years.'' The Stockholm, with a crew of 29 men and three women, spends two weeks a month at sea, patrolling and following up some of the hundreds of reports from citizens claiming to have seen a periscope or a diving sub. Sometimes the invader turns out to be a frisky seal or swimming moose. The antisubmarine unit can muster two corvettes, 12 submarines, seven minelayers, 16 patrol boats and 12 helicopters _ all equipped with the latest sonar. `` One or two ships is not enough against a submarine,'' <PERSON> Danielsson </PERSON> said. The tactic is to box in the intruder with sonar signals from all directions, then close in and open fire. Because it has never snared an intruder, the unit has had a credibility problem. Foreign experts have suggested the Swedes may prefer to let the intruders go to avoid a diplomatic fuss. <PERSON> Danielsson </PERSON> said that was n't true. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, which has not fought a war since 1814, dismissed the submarine threat until 1981 when a Soviet sub ran aground near the naval complex at <LOCATION> Karlskrona </LOCATION>. The incident jarred Swedes into understanding their neutrality was no defense against foreign military adventures. Experts who investigated a 1982 engagement also concluded the other intruders were also Soviet submarines, and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> lodged a diplomatic protest with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The inquiry also disclosed the existence of previously unknown minisubs launched from conventional submarines equipped with caterpillar tracks to crawl on the seabed. Re-examining previous incidents, the Swedes concluded that the Soviets had been violating Swedish waters since the early 1960s. Although the navy claims many confirmed sightings of alien subs, the Swedish government has not made any formal accusation against any nation. The most recent engagement began Aug. 27 off the west coast north of <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION>, but the chase was abandoned after two weeks. The government has said it lacks the evidence to substantiate a charge against any specific country for that incident. The Soviets deny their ships are involved and have suggested the incursions are imagined. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> analysts believe that in wartime, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would want to neutralize Swedish defenses to allow its ground and air forces to transit <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>. The Baltic is one of only three sea outlets on the Soviets' western front The others are the frigid Barents Sea north of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, and through <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s narrow Bosporus strait into the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. To <PERSON> Danielsson </PERSON>, a 41-year-old career officer, it does n't matter whether the prowlers are from the West or the Soviet bloc. His job is to stop them. <PERSON> Danielsson </PERSON> said the intruders usually come in groups of six: two conventional subs and four minisubs which can slip into the inner-archipelago of some 24,000 islands. Often, they operate in several squads at the same time along the coast to tax <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s defense resources Their mission is `` pure intelligence, to learn everything there is to know about our coastal defenses,'' <PERSON> Danielsson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Danielsson </PERSON>'s 330-ton corvette is armed with artillery and depth charges that could sink a sub, but much of its weaponry is intended to punch holes in the hull of a sub and force it to the surface, rather than destroy it. The ship bristles with the latest electronics. Its operations room is crammed with radar, sonar and television screens like a darkened arcade of space-age video games. But submarines have the advantage of the underseas terrain. A craggy, mountainous seabed provides camouflage along a coast that stretches 4,750 miles. A strange mixture of varying water temperatures and salinity work to deflect the hunters' sonar, and a junkyard of wrecks and metalic rocks bounce back a confusing blizzard of sonar beeps. `` We have learned a lot since 1982, and the first thing we learned was that it is much harder than we thought to catch a sub,'' said <PERSON> Danielsson </PERSON>. `` He can go down to the bottom and pretend to be a rock, or he can move away very fast,'' <PERSON> Danielsson </PERSON> said, and the normal chances of finding him are `` less than one 1 percent.'' The incursions are so politically sensitive that the commander said he would not be surprised if the intruders blew themselves up rather than surrender. `` These are pros, not amateurs. We will never see a submarine coming up and waving a white flag,'' he said.

<HEAD>Philippines Senator Calls for Slow Down in Investigations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIGUEL C. SUAREZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senator has called on his congressional colleagues to slow down on investigations. The probes, he said, often never end and keep legislators and other officials from more useful work. `` I have nothing against such investigations per se,'' Sen. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguisag </PERSON> said. `` But I do n't think that when we were elected last year, we would be let loose _ we, 200-plus members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ to investigate everyone and everybody. ... `` Whatever is in the headlines today, tomorrow it will be investigated.'' He added that the communist insurgency continues and crime increases because generals and police chiefs spend too much time answering questions at congressional hearings. <PERSON> Saguisag </PERSON> made his appeal for a cutback on probes during a television talk show discussion with Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, who took the opposite view. Just hours before the show, <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> called for yet another investigation, the 73rd pending before the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The bicameral <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reconvened last year for the first time since it was abolished in 1972 by the now-deposed President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Since resuming sessions, both houses have initiated scores of probes on controversies chiefly brought out by <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s free-wheeling press. The probes involve subjects ranging from the country's $ 28 billion foreign debt and alleged corruption to religious cults and whether gold bullion is buried under an old <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> fort or if two missing bargeloads of rice are really in the bottom of the sea. In early September, when a top player in the <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION>' professional basketball league was benched for no specified reason during a championship series, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> launched an investigation In some cases, investigations have made matters worse. After a recent congressional fact-finding trip to the southern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Leticia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahani </PERSON> openly accused <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> of annexing six Filipino islands. Her accusation led to calls by other legislators and officials for action just short of war. Mrs. <PERSON> Shahani </PERSON> later apologized, however, saying she failed to verify an allegation made by a naval officer, who had misread a navigational chart. <PERSON> Saguisag </PERSON>, a Harvard-trained lawyer, complained that in many cases, the probes fade into oblivion after media interest wanes. Often, investigations would never have been started if congressmen had bothered to think twice about them, he said. `` I'm dumbfounded by the lack of preliminary staff work,'' <PERSON> Saguisag </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, the lone opposition member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, recently called for investigations into alleged corruption involving relatives of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and the sale of a lot in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last year. Just before the TV show, he asked for an investigation into what a newspaper called a list of `` economic saboteurs'' prepared by <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayme </PERSON>, which included unidentified legislators. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> maintained on the show that probes were necessary to help legislators gather information to prepare legislation. In cases of alleged corruption involving presidential relatives, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should investigate because no one else will. <PERSON> Saguisag </PERSON> said that if investigations were unavoidable, congressmen should be `` more restrained'' in what they say in their sessions about other people, who might be slandered and have no means of redress because congressmen enjoy immunity. <PERSON> Saguisag </PERSON> acknowledged, nevertheless, that as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s ethics committee, he himself is conducting several probes. Asked by program host <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> what punishment <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can give erring congressmen, <PERSON> Saguisag </PERSON> replied that in the 1950s, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was suspended for 15 months because he made false charges against the president. `` I am willing to be suspended for 15 months,'' <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said. `` I can use it for vacation. But if I will get suspended for the error of information I received, I expect that an equal measure will be applied to a senator of the ruling coalition who has brought us to the brink of war.'' That was a reference to Mrs. <PERSON> Shahani </PERSON> and her erroneous charge against <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Mention <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> and many words spring to mind before `` tasteful.'' That, however, is exactly the word for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s two-hour movie biography of the flamboyant entertainer, airing Sunday. `` Liberace'' is ever-so-careful with the image of the performer, who died in February 1987 of complications from AIDS. That's due no doubt to the fact that this production was sanctioned by his estate and allowed to use his fabulous home, cars, costumes and jewels in the filming. Another Liberace movie will follow a week later on CBS. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> version is insistently simplistic and adoring, even while constantly raising the question of his sexuality. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> always denied he was a homosexual and his spokespeople always denied he had AIDS. The movie strongly hints that he was gay and does make plain that he died of AIDS. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> stars as <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rue </PERSON> <PERSON> McClanahan </PERSON> plays his mother. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> plays his long-time confidante, <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> _ inexplicably a dark brunette throughout the movie even though <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> was fair-haired _ is kind, gentle and good, dedicated to his public and his beloved mother. His sexual preference is a nagging, unspoken problem. When he announces his intention to marry a young woman he has met at church, <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> abruptly excuses himself from the room. The woman's father calls off the wedding because of `` rumors'' and fears that <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> and his daughter would never produce grandchildren. Years later, when <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s sister-in-law surprises him by setting him up with an adoring female fan, he rushes from the room in embarrassment. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorson </PERSON>, the companion and employee who filed a palimony suit against <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> in 1982, is portrayed -LRB- by <PERSON> Marius </PERSON> <PERSON> Valainis </PERSON> -RRB- as an opportunist who turned on <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> after he was fired. As <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> explains the relationship to <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>, `` It's something about strays, about being needed.'' At one point, after the <PERSON> Thorson </PERSON> affair becomes public, <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> is asked point-blank by a reporter if he is homosexual. He answers the question by saying he does n't believe `` that entertainers should publicly air their sexual or political tastes.'' But he adds, `` with a name like <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>, which stands for freedom, I'm for anything with the letters L-I-B, and that includes gay lib.'' If the filmmakers wanted to avoid dwelling on <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s love life, they could have spent more time on his music. There are several musical numbers _ <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Garson </PERSON> was the piano stand-in, though <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> does a good job of faking it _ but <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s proficiency at the piano seems to be maintained magically, since he is never shown to have any particular passion for the instrument Instead, there's shallow pop psychology. For instance, his musician father walked out on the family just before Christmas, so <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was determined that every Christmas thereafter would be happy. And trivia _ he first saw a candelabra on a piano in the movie `` A Song to Remember.'' To its credit, the movie never aspires to be anything more than an affectionate portrait of a kind man who gave his all, and the best scenes are in the concluding montage: a triumphant <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> performs an exhausting sellout run at <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, while backstage he struggles against the disease that will kill him within months. At one point, he admits to <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> that he regrets never having had children, even though he always said his 21 dogs substituted for them. At the end of the movie, the words appear on the screen, `` <PERSON> Wladziu </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> died from complications relating to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome on February 4, 1987.'' This is followed by a brief epilogue in which <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, as a young <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>, comes out and sits at a piano lit only by the candelabra. `` I'd like to be remembered as a kind and gentle soul who made the world a little better place to live in because I lived in it,'' he says. Then he blows out the candles one by one.

 For a decade, in a bucolic corner of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> ran his <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> for Children. From time to time, tales of abuse circulated, but nothing came of them _ <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> is one of six states where such church homes are unlicensed and rarely scrutinized. But as this summer began, a boy's tale of beatings, neglect and imprisonment brought state authorities to <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>'s door and ignited a conflict fueled by outrage from both sides. `` Gates of Hell'' is the story of these children, who have been given pseudonyms to protect their identities as required by <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> law, of their lives inside <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> and of the emotional struggle over their futures _ and their souls. This is the first installment of three.

 The time had come. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> was ready. He would hide and wait, and when the moment was right, he would blow through the gates of hell and never look back. Quietly now, quietly. He slipped inside the locker and waited, hardly breathing. The other kids at the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> Home for Children were filing past, on their way to church. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> opened the locker door. To the bicycle by the steps. Carefully now, carefully. If anyone saw, he would be caught, and there'd be more punishment, more pain, more humiliation. No more. He'd had enough for a lifetime.

 <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Prine </PERSON> had just finished stabling her horse when the phone rang Sunday, May 8. It was after 7 p.m.. As a child welfare investigator in <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, she was used to calls at all hours, seven days a week It was the sheriff's office: another runaway from <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> That was n't unusual. The Baptist church home's 10-year history was rife with kids trying to escape its rigorous regimen. <PERSON> Prine </PERSON> had dealt with some of <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>'s children but had never seen the operation firsthand. Because the state does not license its church-run boarding homes, and therefore can not regulate them, it rarely ventures in. Among those who have, some call them hospitals for the soul; others consider them spiritual torture chambers. The truth about the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> Home for Children was a matter of opinion. In 1980, a runaway brought assault charges against <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>'s founder, the Rev <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, for a beating he received with a switch _ `` licks,'' Fountain called them. After a hearing, the <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge removed all the children and directed the church to follow certain regulations. But the charges were dropped and the order was never enforced. Many of the children were returned to <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>. Since then, other children had run away, and others told stories of abuse and neglect. But few had been at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> long enough to be credible witnesses, the kind whose stories would hold up in court. Now there was <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 He had come to <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> in October 1986 at age 13, a sometime truant sent from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> by his mother. Life might have been hard at home, but <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> was like boot camp with a wrathful God as drill sergeant. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s description was the same as those of other children and that of <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> himself. Each day had a schedule: up at 5 a.m., so many minutes in the bathroom, so many minutes to dress, so many to clean the dormitory. There were prayer sessions morning and evening. In the summers, the children picked beans, pulled weeds on the church's 28 acres, dug ditches, picked up trash and cared for <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>'s menagerie of goats, horses, ducks and deer. Sometimes crews of children would tear down abandoned buildings, including some at <ORGANIZATION> Keesler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>, and return with what they salvaged to <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, where it would become part of new structures they built themselves. There was no payment for work, but plenty of punishment for slackers. In the winters, they had Bible memorization and school. Lessons came from religious workbooks. Often, children had to erase other children's answers to fill in their own. Like every new <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> charge, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> spent his first month `` on watch'' under the eye of more trusted child. Children on watch were allowed to speak only to designated individuals. It was a way to prevent them from planning escapes. Talking on watch meant sure punishment.

 There were no calls to parents for the first two months, and no visits for the first six. Incoming mail was opened and money was removed. Letters home that complained about <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> were ordered rewritten. Telephone calls, when allowed, were monitored. Meals were heavy on oatmeal, grits and rice. At the end of the week, leftovers were mixed together, a meal the kids called `` compost stew.'' Failure to eat everything on the plate brought punishment. No cigarettes, drugs, alcohol or carbonated drinks were allowed. There was no television, no radio, no movies: these worldly media were of the devil. So were newspapers, magazines and most music, except certain religious selections. At night, trusted children guarded the doors against runaways. No one was allowed out. This was the program, steeped in fundamental religion, rooted in biblical principles and imbued, its supporters said, with the Lord's power to change incorrigibles into God-fearing, clean-living Christians. And anyone who deviated from it, in word, deed or spirit, learned a lesson about pain. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> had learned those lessons well.

 <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Maples </PERSON> questioned <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> closely. <PERSON> Maples </PERSON> had been <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> County </PERSON> prosecutor only since January, but he had already interviewed several former <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> children. The 30-year-old <PERSON> Maples </PERSON> had grown up in <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and he knew a little about <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>. In a town the size of <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION>, with 2,500 residents, it was hard to avoid. Some days at lunchtime, <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> preachers stood out on Main Street, hollering about hell and damnation to passersby. That usually prompted stories from the patrons at the nearby Coffee Pot restaurant, but mostly they left the subject alone. After all, they figured, none of the kids out there was local; they probably were bad kids who deserved what they got. Now this boy was telling Maples stories as awful as any he had heard. It would take testimony from those who'd left earlier and knew <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, and two more who would leave after his escape, to corroborate his treatment from the day he arrived to the day he fled <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>.

 In 1969, <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> was a heroin addict dabbling in witchcraft. He had forsaken his native Oklahoma for the streets of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; in three years, he says, he lost his family and his health, ending up in a <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> hospital with hepatitis from shooting up with a dirty needle. Then he found the Lord. Born again, he won back his family and went off to bible college in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, later moving to <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to join the ministries of the Rev. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Roloff </PERSON>, an evangelist who ran a well-publicized home for troubled children before his death in a 1982 plane crash. Fountain felt the call to begin his own ministry and his own children's home, and in 1978, he, wife <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>, and seven children pulled into <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION>. His Bethel Baptist church and children's home thrived. At one point, as many as 150 children were on campus. Parents who could afford it paid $ 275 a month plus $ 750 for materials and registration. Some paid less. Some paid nothing. It did n't matter to Fountain. The Lord had called him for this work. The state had tried to shut him down in 1980 and failed. Six years later, the welfare department raided the <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> Home for Girls in <LOCATION> Hattiesburg </LOCATION>, run by his friend, the Rev. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wills </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Wills </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON>. The 113 girls taken from the home spoke of strip-searches, paddlings and starvation diets. One-fourth of the girls reported missing their menstrual periods for two months to a year _ the result, Mrs. <PERSON> Wills </PERSON> forthrightly explained, of stress brought on by much-needed discipline. Discipline. That was the key to a spiritual life, the <PERSON> Willses </PERSON> believed, and <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> agreed wholeheartedly. Children needed discipline. It said as much in the Bible, and his charges knew Proverbs 23:13 by heart: `` Do not withhold correction from a child, For if you beat him with a rod, he will not die. You shall beat him with a rod And deliver his soul from hell.'' That was Fountain's calling: delivering young souls from hell.

 The Rev. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, founder of the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> Home for Children, had been accused before of abusing children in his care, although little was done. But this time was different. State Welfare Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who had become increasingly convinced that many <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> kids were being physically and emotionally brutalized, would not back down. The battle lines were drawn. The first stones would be cast by frightened children. This is the second of three installments.

 On June 1, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> took the witness stand. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> was staring at him. The story <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> told was one of a child subjected to constant ridicule and bullying. Hardly a day passed of his 18 months at the <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> for Children when he was not hit with a switch for some offense, real or imagined. Talking without permission, slacking off on a job, looking at a girl: all were unpardonable offenses at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>. The whippings left bruises and raised welts. Some children later testified at <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s hearing that they saw others bleed, and their clothing would stick to the dried blood. Laps were another common punishment. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said he would be awakened at 4 a.m., an hour before the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> day began, and made to run laps around a track. Twenty-five laps, or about 2 -LCB- miles, was a typical distance. Sometimes, the run would be timed: 45 seconds a lap. Those who could n't keep up the 7.5 minute per mile pace had to run more, or received other punishment. Push-ups were common; even the smallest boys might be told to do 50. The `` rose garden'' was a series of calisthenics _ push-ups, leg lifts, sit-ups. Children ordered to do a `` minefield'' walked up and down a football field on their hands and toes. Brother <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, in charge of the girls, was known among the children for two particular exercises: the `` chair,'' in which a child had to assume a sitting position against a wall, and another where she would stand on tiptoe with her chin against the wall as high as she could hold it. When the children were put to work, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> more often than not was in the `` nigger crew,'' the boys assigned to do the dirtiest, most strenuous work. He might work his way to a good crew, but a moment of horseplay would send him right back to nigger crew, where he would be forced to do something even worse than before. While a backhoe and bulldozer sat idle, the crew dug a ditch, 4-feet-deep and a half-mile long, and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> was ordered to dig in front of the rest, where the ground had yet to be broken. When they started the ditch, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said later, six children tried to run away. Some children said they were injured while working or were forced to work or run laps while ill. Some received prompt medical attention, but others did not. A local doctor testified he told <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> adults that <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> would lose sight in one eye without glasses, but they were never ordered. Once, other children were told to throw dirt clods at him while he was in the ditch. Sometimes he was subjected to the `` nigger pile''; on a leader's order, other children would hit him, knock him to the ground and pile on top of him. Sleep was no escape. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, who suffered from a bed-wetting problem, was put on all-night `` pee watch,'' awakened hourly to urinate, whether or not he needed to, and punished if he refused. When he wet the bed, he was hit again. Daily humiliation and punishment for a problem he could n't control became unbearable, and he sought out an older boy, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, for advice `` I said, ` Let the Lord handle it,''' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said later. `` Scott, I'm tired of waiting around for the Lord,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> replied. `` I'm going to do something myself.''

<TEXT>
 On June 8, the second day of <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s hearing, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Maples </PERSON>, the county prosecutor, called <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> to the stand. It was about time, <PERSON> Maples </PERSON> felt, for Fountain to explain himself. Fountain had other ideas. The state was meddling. This was a church matter, and it would remain so. Beyond giving his name and address, he refused to answer questions, citing the `` separation of church and state.'' `` Who's in charge at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Maples </PERSON> asked. `` The Lord <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>,'' Fountain replied. `` What mortal is in charge at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Maples </PERSON> tried again. `` No mortal is in charge,'' <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said. `` We are a group of reborn Christians serving the Lord <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, and he alone is in charge.'' Questions about the childrens' nutrition, education, punishment, work and medical needs went unanswered. Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> found Fountain in contempt of court and ordered him to jail, a sentence that lasted 30 minutes. Jail, the judge decided, was not going to compel this man to cooperate. `` He could see it in my eyes,'' <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said later. Later that week, <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> found Fountain, <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and another assistant, Brother <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, in contempt and ordered fines totaling $ 1,500 a day until they agreed to cooperate. The fines would top $ 100,000, but <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> had made his decision. So had the judge. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s story had convinced him of physical abuse, medical neglect and unreasonable detention, at the very least. The other children would be removed from <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, and he would hear their stories, too.

 Arrangements were made to take the children by bus to the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Whitfield </LOCATION>, a mental institution with enough security and vacant dormitories to house them temporarily. Back at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> gathered the children in the church. `` You're going to a nuthouse,'' he told them. `` I have no more control over you.'' Within minutes, the serene campus was in an uproar. As welfare workers and buses stood by, some children scurried for the trees, police on their heels. State troopers and sheriff's deputies spent hours picking up others found wandering along the streets or hiding in private homes. Other children went willingly. `` In a way, I felt good,'' 12-year-old <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> said of the chance to leave <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>. `` In a way I felt bad, because there were some kids who did not have homes, did n't have nowhere to go. Some kids did n't know what to do. `` That was their home.''

 Many of the children of <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> are human throwaways, tossed out by parents who no longer want to deal with them or no longer know how. Some of the kids have no parents. Others simply feel as if they do n't. `` I would phone,'' said 12-year-old <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>, clutching his red-leather Bible. `` But they would n't accept my calls.'' The children, whose names have been changed to meet <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> law about juveniles' identities, came from across the nation, with the majority from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Some had physical or mental disabilities such as hyperactivity or Down's syndrome Some had emotional problems, drug or alcohol habits or had been in trouble with the police. Others were typical teen-agers experiencing the upheaval of adolescence, and all the confusion and rebellion that comes with growing up. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, adopted at age 7 by people who later changed their minds, bounced in and out of foster homes for years. His last family sent him to <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> two years ago. `` My parents had written me after I was there for a while and said the reason I was there was because they did n't have the facilities to handle me and take care of me. `` They wanted someone who would take the responsibility on them of bringing me up right. My parents never really wanted me.'' Freed from <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> by the state, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> earned his GED equivalency certificate -LRB- because the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> school is unaccredited, its diplomas are not recognized by any state -RRB- and applied for cosmetology school. He began dating <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON>, another former <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> resident, and they plan to marry someday and raise a family. Both say <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> taught them how not to treat children. `` I'm not going to have my kid switched every second he acts up,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to make sure I can deal with it.'' `` I'd try to work out any problems with my child,'' said 15-year-old <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON>, who wants to be a teacher. `` If that did n't work, I'd keep on trying I'd never give up. I'd never send them to a place like <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> are in counseling now, as are all the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> children in state custody. Months and months of being told that the outside world is Satan's playground, that saying, thinking, doing or feeling certain things will send them straight to hell, has left many confused and fearful. But for others, <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> is salvation. Outsiders do n't understand what they were, what they've become, and what they went through along the way. One after the other they will say they deserved the whippings they used to get, but they do n't deserve the bad rap they're getting now. These are Fountain's success stories, followers like <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON>, who call the pastor `` Daddy.'' Arriving at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> in 1985 was like landing on another planet for the rebellious 16-year-old street veteran from <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, a drug abuser and runaway who frequented every tavern's ladies night in town. `` I thought these people were crazy,'' she recalled. `` I got smart to Brother Fountain, and he said, ` I'm going to bust your bottom!' He showed me a switch. I thought, ` A twig! What's that going to do?''' She soon found out. Back talk to the dorm leader ended in a brawl broken up by <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and his switch. `` He smacked me around,'' <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> said. `` It's the first spanking I ever got. And whoa! I knew they meant business. I was cussing up a storm.'' The head leader slapped <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON>'s face, and when <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> came back, he slapped her, too. `` I said, ` Go ahead and kill me.' Everything had been drained out of me,'' she said. `` All that rebellion that I had built up for 16 years of my life was gone. The devil really was beat out of me.'' She spent a week in the revival room, a small, windowless room used to isolate disruptive children, where two girls pointed out the error of her ways. `` They talked to me and they helped me and they showed me the Lord, and I got saved.'' Her eyes opened, she realized she had finally come home. `` You can say, ` Do good, do good. But they lived it. They're really happy,'' <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> said, and she started to cry `` I came here and they showed me something like a reason to live, a purpose in life.'' Now 20 and married, dandling her baby boy on her lap, <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> believes she has found the happiness she craved. `` I love this home,'' she said resolutely. `` I ca n't believe what all these ignorant people are doing, saying I'm brainwashed! If I'm brainwashed, I think everybody needs to be.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The court-ordered removal of children from the
Bethel Home for Children due to suspicion of brutality and neglect
infuriated founder Herman Fountain, who bitterly regretted his
failure to defy authorities in the name of church rights. Before
the battle of Bethel was over, he would have another chance to do
just that. This is the third and concluding installment of ``Gates
of Hell.''

 Friday's raid at the <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> for Children was followed by Monday's last stand. Over the weekend, word reached Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> that some of the children who had fled police had returned to <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>. He ordered authorities back to the church to retrieve any children they could find. <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> founder <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, in <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> awaiting further hearing testimony, caught wind of the action and ordered his staff to ignore the subpoenas that had summoned them and return to <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>. There would be no compromise on this day. Fountain locked the church doors, barricading three dozen parents and children in the church they had built by hand. Dozens of state troopers and sheriff's deputies stood by for more than three hours, while Welfare Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> tried to negotiate the childrens' release. Police finally broke in and took the children, while church members recited Bible verse and sang hymns. `` If God be for us who can be against us?'' read the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> sign by the road. Fountain; his eldest son, <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, nicknamed <PERSON> Bubba </PERSON>, and Brother <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> were among eight people arrested that day. Fountain faces three counts of felonious assault on a police officer and one count of inciting a riot, all scheduled to be presented to the grand jury later this month. Troubles seemed to overrun the pastor like the locusts of Pharaoh's <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. A former <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> resident, <PERSON> Rhonnda </PERSON> <PERSON> Traxler </PERSON>, gathered reporters outside the courthouse and alleged Fountain sexually molested her and another girl while they were at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>. Fountain denied the accusation and leveled his own: `` You ca n't believe this girl There's no telling how many men she's been with.'' Another former <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> child, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Friery </PERSON>, filed a $ 1 million federal lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Fountain </ORGANIZATION>, alleging assault and battery, abuse, neglect and false imprisonment. Fountain was n't the only one with problems. Many state workers involved in the case received harassing phone calls or believed they were being followed by <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> supporters. <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> sent his 13-year-old daughter out of state after anonymous callers threatened to kidnap her and put her in a church home where she would never be found again.

 Before the Youth Court hearings ended, about half of the more than 70 children taken from <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> had testified. Some were too frightened to appear. `` They're really wicked little kids,'' <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said in a later interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm talking about homosexuals, I'm talking about lesbians, I'm talking about prostitutes. I'm talking about one boy who raped his 84-year-old grandmother. I'm talking about one who murdered his sister. `` I'm talking habitual runaways, I'm talking car thieves, I'm talking nymphomaniacs. <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> dealt with the same youngsters but saw something different. `` For the most part, they're pretty normal kids who have been battered around by life pretty badly,'' the welfare commissioner said. `` They're children trying to put their lives back together.'' Some parents had despaired of getting help from state agencies; for them, <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> was a last resort. For others, it was a matter of convenience. One child was sent to <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> because he `` took food from the refrigerator,'' <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. But as the hearing continued after the raid on <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, some parents sat in the courtroom and wept, overwhelmed by stories of hair-pulling, face-slapping, lap-running and switchings. A 13-year-old girl with Down's syndrome said she ran laps all day long, received frequent spankings and sometimes stood for hours on tiptoe with her chin above a light switch. `` They said she was a little brat and had a demon in her,'' another girl said. `` Parents agreed with it. They said that's what you deserve if you've acted in a wrong way.'' Some parents said they were misled. They did n't know what <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> really was. Other parents knew exactly what <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> was. `` When I went down there, I was totally convinced what had occurred was not morally right, legally right or anyway right,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Birdsboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. But his two teen-age sons support Fountain, and they changed his mind.

 `` They love the man tremendously. If my children said to me, ` Dad, that's not the way it was, they were cruel and abused us,' I'd be after Brother Fountain,'' he said. `` But they've solidified my support.'' About 50 of the children were released to their parents, who signed a court agreement not to return them to <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> without the judge's approval. Protecting the children this way was about all the state and Judge <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> could do since <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> is a private, unregulated facility. Now a dozen parents, including <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, are preparing a lawsuit against the state for its action at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>. `` I look at this much beyond just an incident that occurred in the state of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said. `` Let's term it religious harassment.'' __ = Life is slow at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> these days, with so few children around The home remains open, but rows of girls' bunk beds stand empty except for the stuffed bears and rabbits left behind by former occupants. A few new children have come since the hearings. A few former residents have returned. No winner has emerged from the emotional battle over <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, which begins and ends with a collision of convictions. <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> and his team of investigators, <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> and prosecutor <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Maples </PERSON> consider it a matter of child protection. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, his faithful flock and other fundamentalists who came to lend support have called it an issue of religious freedom. Conservative religious belief courses through <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s veins and beats fiercely in its heart The perception that the state is venturing into the realm of the church makes blood run hot. But so does the perception that church home operators are using fundamental religion and the Bible as justification to abuse and neglect children. `` I'm a Christian; they're supposed to be Christians,'' said welfare investigator <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Prine </PERSON>, who teaches Sunday school at her Baptist church. `` I believe this is wrong. These kids are being physically abused. These people claim the kids are liars and are not being abused but are being raised by what the Bible says. `` It makes you question your faith and your job. When we went in there, I asked someone, ` Am I hurting the church? Am I hurting God's work by doing this?' I thought about it, and I said, ` No. No, I'm not.''' <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>, in his order removing the children from <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, wrote, `` If there is a conflict of interests between religion and the protection of children, this Court's decision must be to protect first the children.'' Fountain sees it another way. `` I dealt with -LRB- <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> -RRB- in chambers, about his soul. He says, ` The laws of the land are first and that -LRB- the -RRB- Bible's second,''' <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said. `` I said, ` That's wrong, that Bible's first and the law of the land is second.' <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, along with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, has no law licensing church-run boarding homes, although some voluntarily apply for licenses. As a result, there is no way to reach many of the children in such homes, many of whom are denied communication with the outside for months at a time, or to ensure that basic educational, sanitation and safety standards are met. `` We've had to wait years to collect information in bits and pieces from runaway children,'' <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. `` We have no way of knowing what's going on inside those four walls.'' <PERSON> Maples </PERSON> has filed a court petition to force <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> to comply with state laws governing education, safety standards and child labor laws. The court has yet to act on it. If enforced, such an order could close <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, because Fountain has said he would never cooperate. For the two years he has been welfare commissioner, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> has pushed for a law to open the doors of homes like <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>; Fountain has prayed against one. This might well be the year that the power of prayer is overcome by the power of politics: observers agree that outrage over conditions at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> has been so great that the Legislature might be forced to act. Even Fountain agrees, saying, `` It would take an act of God'' to prevent a licensure law from emerging in the next legislative session. At <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, they will be praying round the clock. `` They're going against God, and that's their problem. That's why we're going to win,'' <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said `` The gates of hell ai n't going to prevail against our church.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was a cross-country track star, captain of the tennis team and, at only 5-foot-8, a guard on the basketball team emulating the backcourt hustle of rookie <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousy </PERSON>, his idol on the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celtics </ORGANIZATION>. He played first trumpet in the band, suffering chapped lips in the Thanksgiving Day football classic with ancient rival <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>. `` Oikonomia'' _ economy, as preached by his father _ dictated chores after school and odd jobs like working as a garbage collector on summer vacations. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> does n't recall his `` being particularly penurious, but none of us had much back then. A heavy date was an ice cream soda at Ho-Jo's. We went to lots of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> games. He was a rabid fan, and I presume in those days the boy always bought the tickets.'' Fibbing about his age, l7-year-old <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> entered the 26-mile <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marathon </ORGANIZATION>. Practically the whole senior class turned out to cheer him up <PERSON> Heartbreak </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and beg cups of water from the drugstores along <LOCATION> Beacon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> as he finished a respectable 57th. As recorded in <LOCATION> Murivian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>'s yearbook, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was elected president and `` pledged allegiance to the ideals of the <ORGANIZATION> Honorary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, Alpha Pi.'' `` Big Chief Brain in the Face,'' as the book dubbed him, was too busy that frantic senior year to notice <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, a pretty freshman and already outspoken feminist, who a dozen years later would be introduced to her future husband and now presidential candidate by her best friend <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakalar </PERSON>. `` Running as if chased by Republicans,'' as <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, the college weekly, noted, marathon man <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> continued to excel in cross-country at <LOCATION> Swarthmore </LOCATION>, where even the football team sometimes experienced the loneliness of the long-distance runner. Letters to the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> regularly complained that alumni outnumbered students in the wooden bleachers that still resemble a Little League field. Sports were definitely small-time at <LOCATION> Swarthmore </LOCATION>, where home runs landed in the astronomy professor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>'s rose garden. Only the chess team went undefeated in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> years, but the football team finally had a winning season, 4-3, in his senior year. The Garnets, also called the <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quakers </ORGANIZATION>, managed to suit up some outstanding athletes. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, two years ahead, went directly from the campus to the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pirates </ORGANIZATION> outfield. Tight end <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` Chuck'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s junior year roommate, turned down a contract with the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Rams and went on to become an economic adviser to several occupants of the White House. Founded by the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> in 1864, <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION> had long since dropped its denominational ties, but the Quaker ideals of tolerance, high standards of personal conduct and dedication to world peace and disarmament still wafted across campus like a benign breeze. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Military Adademy was kindly requested not to fire its touchdown cannon at football games. On Thursday mornings the entire student body gathered in Clothier Memorial for `` collection,'' an assembly dedicated to moral or cultural uplift by friendly persuasion. In World War I, an army training unit was permitted on campus, but the cadets paraded without rifles. British poet W.H. <PERSON> Auden </PERSON> taught composition to a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> V-12 unit in World War II, when the campus was a meld of O.C.'s and C.O.'s: cadet officers and conscientious objectors. After much agonizing, the administration rejected an <ORGANIZATION> ROTC </ORGANIZATION> unit during the Korean War. Two months after arriving on campus, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Nov. 3, l951, celebrated his 18th birthday by registering for the draft. There were recurrent reminders in the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> from Gen. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> that students were not exempt but deferred from the draft if they maintained a C-average. An army recruiter took pains one day to explain that `` in an infantry division of 20,000 men, only 3,000 carried rifles while the great majority were occupied in non-combat units.'' His remarks concluded to polite applause and the release of a dove. `` Many were critical of our involvement in the war,'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stott </PERSON> remembers, `` but the college made it clear this was a moral obligation.'' Actually, fraternities were a bigger issue on campus in the early'50s. <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION> was and is a dry town, and the five frat houses offered beer along with brotherhood. `` A wild Friday night party might go on until 12:30,'' says <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, who like <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, belonged to <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upsilon </ORGANIZATION> when their <LOCATION> Wharton </LOCATION> dorm mate <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> signed a letter in the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> telling freshmen they did n't need to join a fraternity to have a good time at <LOCATION> Swarthmore </LOCATION>. His main objection was a clause in some national charters discriminating against Jews and blacks. When a campus poll favored retaining fraternities, two of which still survive, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> served on a bipartisan committee that recommended severing ties with national fraternities that discriminated.

<TEXT>
 As congressional anti-subversive investigators began questioning professors at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, young <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> joined and soon became campus president of Students for Democratic Action. He lobbied rural lawmakers to oppose a loyalty oath bill in the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Assembly </LOCATION> and, according to <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Navasky </PERSON>, now editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>, talked one out of every four schoolmates into joining the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s excesses had a great deal to do with my seriously thinking about entering politics,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> recently recalled. In the election year of 1952, he was president of Students for <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, who by a healthy margin became the first Democrat to win the campus straw vote. Although Republicans were `` thin on the ground'' to test the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> debating skills, <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> recalls a bull session on the third floor of <LOCATION> Wharton </LOCATION> `` when someone mentioned that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> had it in him to go all the way, meaning the White House.'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> also remembers the spring of their junior year `` when murmurs of real excitement ran through the dining hall as <PERSON> Jo-Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> spread the word that her father, Justice <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, had just telephoned news of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision outlawing school segregation. At <LOCATION> Swarthmore </LOCATION>, that was bigger than a World Series result.'' <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION>'s liberalism rankled many of the neighbors in the rest of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> where Republicans outnumbered Democrats 8 to l. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> recently recalled for an alumni group in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> how the conductor on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION> local always sang out as the train approached the station before <LOCATION> Swarthmore </LOCATION>: `` <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, the stop before <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' His admission to the honors program, which <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION> pioneered, put him in the top eschelon of a remarkably brainy student body. His campus contemporaries included <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenin </PERSON>, a quiet member of the wrestling team who would win a Nobel Prize in medicine; <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, the future <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> scholar <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieverts </PERSON>, budding novelist <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissenson </PERSON> and future physicians <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burtis </PERSON>, his hitchhiking buddy on summer vacations. But the undergrad going was n't all grind. There were midnight sled rides down <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> on cafeteria trays. `` Freshman Serenade,'' a fall fertility rite, erupted into a panty raid his first year. The girls on the top floor of <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> defended their lingerie by dumping wastebaskets of water on the male marauders and inserting toilet plungers into the handles of the dorm's double doors. Dean of Men <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> appeared out of the shadows to restore order and was promptly deluged with a tub of sudsy laundry water. `` Proves the campus is n't completely lifeless,'' he sputtered philosophically, taking to his bed with a bad case of chills. Next term the Poenix reported `` two gentlemen adventurers'' were suspended for a week for scaling the college water tower `` and engraving thereon fraternal Greek letters.'' Then there was the outrageous <PERSON> Adlai </PERSON> hoax that brought reporters and photographers swarming to the campus from the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> dailies. At the beginning of the 1953 spring term, <LOCATION> Swarthmore </LOCATION> was seeking a replacement for President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nason </PERSON>, who was leaving to head the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Irish </PERSON>, who ran with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the cross-country team, raced through the night to the firm that printed the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and substituted a bogus front page that proclaimed in tabloid-sized headlines `` Adlai Prexy!!'' The story spuriously quoted outgoing president <PERSON> Nason </PERSON>, `` if our students thought Mr. <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> would make a good president for the country then he ought to be good enough for our college.'' The administration was aghast and embarrassed, but <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> on vacation in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> was amused and cabled his `` hope that the college will not deal harshly with my beloved and youthful friends.'' Elected to <LOCATION> Phi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Betta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kappa </LOCATION>, as well as president of the student council, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was one of five in a class of 210 to graduate with highest honors. He might have been and should have been president of his graduating class. The yearbook shows him seated with officers of the Class of'55, but shortly after it went to press, <LOCATION> Swarthmore </LOCATION>, with characteristic egalitarianism, voted to abolish all class officers. Now another <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> is the focus of attention at <LOCATION> Swarthmore </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Chkhenkeli </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Tblisi </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, is among the first of a glasnost coterie of Soviet students arriving at American colleges. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> fulfills a cultural exchange first proposed by the student council when <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was its president.

 The `` Weekly Reader,'' the little newspaper read by generations of American school children, celebrates its 60th birthday this fall, still going strong with 9 million readers.

 The modest periodical first hit grade school desks in 1928. `` Poor Boys Who Made Good Are Now Running for the Highest Office in the World!'' read the headline over stories about <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. So much for news. Inside were stories about dandelions and sunshine, a few rudimentary drawings and a poem extolling the curative powers of cod liver oil. It was an inauspicious beginning for what has proven a classroom institution. `` Weekly Reader,'' the little newspaper read by generations of American school children, celebrates its 60th birthday this fall, still going strong with 9 million readers who pay an average of $ 2.25 a year to subscribe. It will mark the occasion with `` 60 Years of News for Kids,'' a book made up of stories from past editions and aimed at a potentially vast audience: the two-thirds of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> adults who grew up with `` Weekly Reader.'' Eight editions are published for the different grade levels. Among them is current Editor-in-Chief <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Borton </PERSON>, whose own `` Weekly Reader'' years coincided with the end of World War II when subscribers were encouraged to save resources and buy War Bonds. `` I remember a sense of being mobilized by the school and by ` Weekly Reader,''' <PERSON> Borton </PERSON> says. Judging from its promotional materials, Pharos Books, the publisher of `` 60 Years of News for Kids,'' hopes to generate a tidal wave of nostalgia: `` Remember blackboards and chalk dust ... schoolyards and recess ... Fridays and ` Weekly Reader?''' In some instances the book may indeed more accurately reflect chalk dust than history; especially in its early years, `` Weekly Reader'' found much of the news unfit for its pages. It declined to cover the crash of 1929. The Great Depression was played down and the Holocaust was ignored altogether. `` ... We promise to do our share in guarding <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s children from the hazards of fear, tensions and frustration and to contribute to emotional stability through the inspiration and reassurances which the carefully selected current content of ` My Weekly Reader' brings to children,'' founder <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> reassured teachers in 1942. `` Ours shall be a positive philosophy of optimism.'' Accordingly, `` Weekly Reader'' made valiant attempts to put a happy face on World War II. Young readers were told that `` thousands of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> men are learning to cook and sew'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, and that nifty wartime inventions such as `` butter that wo n't spoil, cake flavoring from a tablet, dishes that bounce but do n't break when dropped'' would soon be available for civilian Closer to the news were stories about an imaginary curtain that divided <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> into two parts; a bitter fight between Arabs and Jews over <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> celebrating its independence from <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` Weekly Reader'' also devoted a fair amount of space to news of inventions, innovations and pop culture. `` When the Fairy Godmother turned the pumpkin into a coach, she used magic,'' a 1946 feature began. `` Nowadays, there is a new kind of magic. This magic is called ` plastics.''' Another magical invention announced in 1949: a camera that could make pictures in one minute. The'50s brought slightly harder-edged stories about the Korean War, the <LOCATION> Suez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sputnik </LOCATION>. A 1954 story gave background on a war being fought in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. A 1957 piece focused on plans by six European nations to establish a common market. The newspaper also filled its pages with breathless accounts of postwar progress, of supermarkets and superhighways, convenience foods and jet airplanes, polio vaccines and nuclear power. Readers were reminded in 1951 that `` people making the first long-distance phone calls will have to keep one eye on their watches.'' For the first time, `` there will be no operator to say, ` Sorry, your time is up.''' Two years later, `` Weekly Reader'' reassured kids that TV colors `` are beginning to look more real. <PERSON> Strawberry </PERSON> ice cream in TV ads looks so good that you can almost taste it.'' The year 1953 also brought important news from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>: <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> was dead, replaced by <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Malenkov </PERSON>, of whom `` Weekly Reader'' had this to say: `` His pictures show him to be a short, fat man. <PERSON> Malenkov </PERSON> spends most of his time at his office. He does not like to go to parties or talk with strangers.'' The year 1958 brought a rare product endorsement. `` Hula hoops are made of plastic. They are a good kind of toy. Whirling hoops is good exercise for children.''

 A special memorial issue followed the assassination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Other 1960s stories touched on the summer riots of'68, the Six Day War and the first moon landing. `` Weekly Reader'' covered the war on poverty but shied away from the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` Not everyone goes along with the president's plans in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' a 1968 story said For the most part, `` Weekly Reader'' let it go at that. `` There was a lot of concern about the degree of disagreement over the war,'' <PERSON> Borton </PERSON> says. `` People were uncertain about how to handle that. As a result, the Vietnamese War was barely touched on by the paper.'' Drugs, Watergate, consumerism, the energy crisis, world hunger, the exodus from city to suburb, and the revolution in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> all made headlines in the'70s. Feature stories told of a new hit TV show called `` Sesame Street'' -LRB- 1970 -RRB-, a Soviet gymnast named <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Korbut </PERSON> -LRB- 1973 -RRB-, and a new choking rescue method invented by Dr. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Heimlich </PERSON> -LRB- 1976 -RRB-. Like many newspapers, `` Weekly Reader'' has refined its use of graphics in the'80s. This year's editions have a decidedly more contemporary look, with color photos in all eight editions. `` Weekly Reader'' now routinely reports on such topics as drug abuse, apartheid and the arms race, especially in editions aimed at older children. Stories with `` a strong sexual content'' are avoided, <PERSON> Borton </PERSON> says. While such topics as teen pregnancy are still off-limits, however, a 1987 story for sixth-graders on the life of AIDS victim <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> pulled no punches. `` ... Today, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> weighs barely 60 pounds. ... He holds his cold, blue hands over the red-hot coils of the kitchen stove. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> never seems to get warm anymore ...'' The newspaper covered the attempted assassination of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the Challenger disaster, famine in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and racial conflict in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Other recent stories have focused on missing children and homelessness, the Iran-Contra affair and the Strategic Defense Initiative. `` We do n't skirt problems,'' says <PERSON> Borton </PERSON>. `` We try to inform them about what's happening, but we also try to talk about what people are doing to solve problems, if it's a problem that's being presented.'' The paper, which has changed hands several times, was acquired in 1985 by its current owner, <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest marketer of children's book clubs Unlike at most newspapers, the <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, Conn.-based editorial staff of 15 teachers and journalists and a half-dozen artists spend most of their time at the office, rather than in the field. Stories are culled from other newspapers and magazines, although `` we do try to develop a child's angle,'' <PERSON> Borton </PERSON> says. Occasionally, `` Weekly Reader'' generates news of its own. A 1983 survey of its readers found that 31 percent of fourth-grade subscribers felt pressured to smoke marijuana. The finding prompted changes in federal drug abuse prevention strategy, which has since been modified to include younger kids. The news weekly's current circulation of 9 million is up from 6 million in 1977. Its lowest ebb, which came during a drop in school enrollments, also coincided with the only major format change in the paper's history. `` The paper shifted away from its formula of news and skills in an attempt to appeal more to kids. There was more children's interest, and the news became more featury,'' <PERSON> Borton </PERSON> says `` It did n't work.'' Entertaining children was not what <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had in mind when she conceived the notion of a newspaper written expressly for grade school children. Miss <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, editor-in-chief for 26 years and a consultant for 17 more, died a year ago at age 94. As a young school administrator in <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, Miss <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had been bothered by a lack of emphasis on current events in the classroom. `` I saw that children were being given a lot of myths and folklore to read but were utterly illiterate about what was happening in the world,'' she once said. `` To live in this world, newspaper reading is indispensable.'' The first issue appeared on Sept. 21, 1928, and cost about a penny. Other than the price, `` Weekly Reader'' has n't really changed all that much. It's still guided by its original aim: `` To present selected, well-written news of interest and value to children with accuracy and fairness, colorful but uncolored.'' <PERSON> Borton </PERSON> thinks it's survived because `` it's a lot cheaper than a newspaper, and every child can have one. It's small and easy to handle, and most importantly of all, it's written for kids. `` The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> assumes you understand a great deal about the world. We assume kids in sixth grade understand what kids in sixth grade understand.''

 <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> tells a visitor to come to the 27th floor of an upper <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> building that has only 25 floors. He promises a $ 5 million view with $ 5 worth of furniture. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> will also tell you that the Declaration of Independence was not signed on July 4, 1776, that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> was not the first president, that <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> did not invent the sewing machine and that <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Duryea </PERSON> really manufactured the first automobile regularly made for sale. The 89-year-old ex-newspaperman and author is serious. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> is not just the author, but the entire staff of one of the most unusual and most enduring reference books in the world _ `` Famous First Facts: A Record of First Happenings, Discoveries, and Inventions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' as its first edition was called when it was published in 1933. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> is now working on the fifth edition _ the fourth came out in 1981 _ as well as four other books he hopes to publish within a year or two. Everything emanates out of this unusual apartment that has more paper, 3-by-5 index cards, reference books and book cases than places to sit down. Except for a few plants and the Dr Pepper he keeps in the half-refrigerator, not much in this oddly shaped oblong room seems to have been purchased in the last half-century. Make that century. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, sole inhabitant of this garret for more than 25 years, is not a man who exaggerates. The view from what passes as a kitchen is worth $ 5 million, stretching up the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, beyond the <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, down to the World Trade Center and beyond, across into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. So what if you have to walk up the last two flights because the elevator stops on 25? <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> is author of more than 50 books, some of which he churned out to pay the rent, such as a forgettable volume called `` What Dog Is That?'' describing various breeds of dogs. He also has sold more than 1,000 newspaper articles. He once had his own news service and was an accredited White House correspondent. He has been called a historian, a detective of facts, and a deglorifier of American history. `` History,'' he proclaims, `` is a glorification of fairy tales. There is n't a thing you know that is correct, but still it is better to know something that is wrong than not to know anything.'' It is better, for instance, to think that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> was the first president than not to have any idea. The truth is <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was the first president elected under the Constitution, but <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McKean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> was the first president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Assembled under the Articles of Confederation in 1781, eight years before <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> took office. It is also good to know the importance of July 4, 1776. But the accurate version, according to <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, is that the Declaration of Independence was first ordered `` to be fairly engrossed on parchment'' on July 19, 1776, and was signed in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> on Aug. 2 by 50 members of the original 56 who voted for its adoption. The other six signed at later times, the last being <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McKean </PERSON>, who was permitted to sign as late as 1781 due to serving in the Army away from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` Over 50 people have told me their father invented the automobile, for example,'' he says. `` When I start verifying claims, I find that someone's father may have invented the fourth knob on the fifth spark plug on the sixth day at 7 o'clock,'' says <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>. `` But he did n't invent the automobile.'' It was <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Duryea </PERSON> who opened the <ORGANIZATION> Duryea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wagon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, in 1895. He began building his automobile in 1891 and first successfully operated it on April 19, 1892. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> publishes only those facts that can be verified by patent offices, official records in the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, or other original data. `` I'm stupid enough not to believe anything until I see the proof,'' he says. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> wrote his first book in 1929. It was n't until four years later, rejected by 11 publishers, that he sold the idea to the H.W. <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, with a little help from librarians he met as he crisscrossed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on an 11-month tour. He showed them the local facts, which they knew to be correct, and then beseeched them to write to the California-based company and say they would love to have such a tome in their reference rooms.

 It was n't easy work. `` I've got stuff in that book _ maybe five or six lines _ that has taken me 30 to 40 years to verify.'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> has mellowed with the years. He still gives lectures _ `` rambles'' he calls them _ and manages to irritate the crowd by debunking `` truths'' learned in grade school. But he's softer now. `` I used to be a wise guy. I would write letters correcting people. I once corrected someone on a number of facts in a presentation and I embarrassed him and broke his heart. And after all, what difference does it really make?'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> says he gets three or four calls from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> each year, asking him a question. For the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, he'll answer. But he makes sure. He knows the number and tells the aide he will call back. If the aide gives the right number, then <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> stays on the line and answers the question. When industry calls and asks if he can find some first for them, he explains it will cost $ 35,000 and he wo n't guarantee he'll find the answer. Budget planners do n't hop on that kind of honesty. `` A lot of what I have in the book is there by serendipity. It's not something I set out to look up You ca n't look up half of these things. You just come across them as you go along.'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> plays a 50-year-old record for a visitor, memorabilia from <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>'s career as a writer for the early quiz shows. He wrote all the questions for `` Break the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>,'' a network radio show that began in 1945 and finally finished up on television in the'50s. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> also supplied some questions for `` The $ 64,000 Question'' and `` Double or Nothing'' and had just written a book on how to win on quiz shows when scandal rocked the industry and the book lost its chance to become a big seller. In a safe deposit box, <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> has a number of other treasures, including the first fountain pen, a shoe with a revolving heel to account for wear and the first safety pin with the patent number still on it. That number, for trivia buffs, is 24,517. His newspaper articles are stored in metal boxes, over a century old, that the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> used to keep its records in. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> is an expert on presidents and is working on the fifth edition of `` Facts About the Presidents.'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> is a slightly shrunken 5-feet-8, with white hair, a neatly trimmed white beard, a fairly brisk gait, and general good health, despite a slight hearing loss. He says his parents lived well into their 90s and he intends to do at least as well. `` I've made a rather Faustian pact with the devil,'' he deadpans. `` I'll be ready to go two days after I finish my last project. But you see I've left myself quite an open back door.'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> and a lady friend spend two weeks every year at a Mexican spa, where he relaxes, eats a vegetarian diet and boasts about the fact that the ceilings are dusted twice a day with feather dusters. That compensates for the scorpions noted on the floor. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> sees his tilting at the windmills of history as really a fight for the underdog, the truly creative man or woman who never made the history books because someone else had better public relations skills. His favorite inventor and personal hero is <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, an inventor who died in 1859. It was he, says <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, who invented the sewing machine 12 years before <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> sees most of the true inventors as pathetic figures and <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> outclasses them all. His voice picks up even more life as he talks about <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>. `` I've only given him half the credit to which he is entitled, but when you read it you will cry. He had such a tough life. Everybody said he was crazy, but he was n't.'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s story exemplifies one of <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>'s favorite sayings, one he has on a placard: `` The person with a new idea is a crackpot _ until it succeeds.'' `` The story will bring no one any money, but I think it will be the most interesting biography you will ever read.'' `` Or,'' adds the man who refuses ever to take himself too seriously, `` it will sell six copies.''

<TEXT>
 From the lonely alpine grasslands of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> to the lively streets of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, American Basques are celebrating a renaissance of ethnic traditions that trace back to a Stone Age mystery. Throughout the western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> these hearty people who hail from the <LOCATION> Pyrenees </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> along the border between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> have formed social clubs where they can speak their own language, eat spicy chorizo sausages and sweetbreads drenched in garlic, drink vinegary red wine and anisette coffee, and share a heritage that has baffled scholars for centuries. About 75,000 to 100,000 Americans have Basque blood. Although they are commonly referred to as Basques, they call themselves ` Eskualdunak,' and ` Eskualherria' is the term for their native land. Most live in the West, blending into <LOCATION> Elko </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Winnemucca </LOCATION>, where they live as solid citizens and patriots. They take great pride in claiming Basque sailors helped discover the New World. `` About 20 of <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON>' crewmen were Bizcainos, or Basque people,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieter </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and an expert on Basque migration. South American hero <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolivar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Magellan </PERSON>'s first mate, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, were also Basques. Others came to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> with Spanish explorers in the 1600s and 1700s. `` The real influx did n't begin until the middle of the last century, with the gold rush,'' <PERSON> Bieter </PERSON> says. A move by disgruntled <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lawmakers to tax non-citizen miners prompted the Basques to turn to agriculture in the rich <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Still tucked away in some slow-to-change Western neighborhoods, usually near a railroad station where passenger trains do n't stop anymore, are a few Basque boarding houses. A century ago they were filled with many young shepherds fresh off the boat, trying to get a start in a strange new country. Each American Basque family is only one or two generations removed from a patriarch who crossed <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by train with only a few coins in his pocket and a sign around his neck stating his destination in English so the conductor could tell him where to get off. Brothers followed brothers, cousins trailed cousins, to the vast sheep range of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> where Basques took their wages in old ewes and began building their own herds one animal at a time. From those fledgling flocks many Basques went on to acquire big ranches and, in some cases, great wealth accumulated by frugal living. Many native Basque women also came alone to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to work in boarding houses and restaurants and marry the transplanted shepherds. Two stereotypes of American Basques obscure their true collective character today. One is a lingering romantic notion, both in their European homeland on the <LOCATION> Iberian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and in this country, that has been fostered by books and movies. It portrays them as tranquil farmers tending herds and flocks, drinking copious amounts of wine from their leather pouches and singing sad songs. <PERSON> Voltaire </PERSON> described them as `` the people who dwell, or rather who dance, at the foot of the Pyrenees.'' `` We passed lots of Basques with oxen, or cattle, hauling carts along the road, and nice farmhouses, low roofs, and all white-plastered,'' wrote <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> in `` The Sun Also Rises.'' `` In the Basque country the land all looks very rich and green and the houses and villages look well-off and clean.'' Bieter estimates that today as few as 10 percent of American Basques are in the sheep business, the main reason their parents and grandparents came to this country. Basques now are found at all economic, educational and social levels, and include former Republican Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s Secretary of State <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Cenarrusa </PERSON>. The other stereotype of Basques stems from their nationalist movement in their homeland, carried forward by <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, a violence-prone guerrilla group fighting for an independent Basque nation for its 3.2 million people in an area about the size of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` Just as American Jews feel they have two homelands, one here and one in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, so many American Basques feel something like that,'' says <PERSON> Bieter </PERSON>, an Irishman whose wife, <PERSON> Eloise </PERSON>, is a first-generation American of Basque parents. `` Support for the separatist group <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> among American Basques is minimal, but it is there. That is why the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NABO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has prohibited any political discussion or activity within its group. It is too divisive to allow it.'' Basques are united by distinct physical characteristics, including a large incidence of type O blood with a high RH negative factor, and a low proportion of type B blood. All Basques consider themselves ` noble,' because they were knighted as a nation for services at the ancient battle of <PERSON> Las </PERSON> <PERSON> Navas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolosa </PERSON>. Because American Basques are so scattered in their adopted land, they try hard to hold on to traditions which link them as an ethnic entity. <ORGANIZATION> NABO </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1974 to promote Basque culture and help keep the language alive. Twenty local Basque clubs have been organized in five states, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. They range from the opulent <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> complex that employs a native Basque chef to a small group of sheepherders that meets to play cards and dance in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>.

 But longtime neighbors and non-Basque spouses believe it is their zest for hard work and their scrupulous honesty that sets them apart. `` Work has always been the way to recognition, the most important element in Basque culture,'' <PERSON> Bieter </PERSON> says. `` Next comes family, loyalty to relatives all the way past third cousins. And then there is honesty. If you're caught being dishonest or lazy your reputation is gone. Much of the Basque culture is based on integrity.'' American Basques, like their European relatives who run with the bulls at the Festival of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fermin </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Pamplona </LOCATION>, also love parties. Every summer <ORGANIZATION> NABO </ORGANIZATION> sponsors a festival of traditional singing and dancing, feasting, and a special Basque Roman Catholic mass. The two-day celebration is like a giant family reunion where Basques renew friendships, throw off the cares of a modern, mostly urban life, and show off their cooking, shepherding and musical talents. This year the festival attracted about 4,000 people to <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, doubling its population and helping local ranchers take their minds off too much summer heat and no rain. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Iberlin </PERSON>, the local chairman who organized the event, is a retired sheepman. With his black, deep-set eyes, high cheekbones, olive skin, and strong torso, <PERSON> Iberlin </PERSON> looks 10 years younger than his 66 years. He spent the festival hobbling on crutches because he'd just broken his pelvis `` in an argument with a stubborn horse who wanted to throw me off. I refused to go.'' Like most Basques, <PERSON> Iberlin </PERSON> takes a strange sort of pride in the mystery of Basque origins. `` It gives me a chance to come up with all kinds of theories about where we came from,'' he says with a grin. `` Some people think we come from the lost city of <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION>. Others say we were the first to be Christianized. Perhaps we came from the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> area in southern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. It's my theory that we are related to the Irish. We have the same traits and customs, our farming practices are identical and we have the same black moods.'' Basques will tell you their ancestors can be traced back to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paleolithic </LOCATION> age of about 70,000 years ago and lived in the Pyrenees thousands of years before modern Europeans arrived. <LOCATION> Iberlin </LOCATION>, like many older Basques whose parents were immigrants, learned to speak the native language before English. Called `` Eskuara,'' the Basque language is considered autochthonous _ original and isolated from any other verbal communication on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Legends claim it was spoken by <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> and Eve, and that one of the Adamic-speaking sons of <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> settled in the mountains before the confusion of tongues at the Tower of Babel. Basques like to claim the Devil himself tried to learn it, but after eavesdropping seven years behind a door, he gave up knowing only the word `` bai,'' meaning yes. Perhaps, say the storytellers, he even lost his teeth in the ordeal. The Rev. <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Etcheverry </PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> who is serving three years as cleric to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Basques. Based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, he drives thousands of miles to officiate at weddings, funerals and festivals throughout the West. He was an honored guest in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. `` The Basque community asked the church for its own priest and the first one came over from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 1960,'' <PERSON> Etcheverry </PERSON> says in heavily accented English. `` I am the sixth priest to come. At first it was very hard because I had no English and there were such long travels. I try to serve 4,000 Basque families scattered all over the place. But now I love it, it is a wonderful job, the people are so wonderful. I am truly blessed.'' Throughout the festival, the smoky air was rich with the scent of sizzling sausage and lamb burgers cooking on grills. Some food booths offered strong cheeses and course, dense Basque bread for sale. Other stalls sold wool blankets and crafts, photographs of sheep and shepherds, and Basque souvenirs imported from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The festival's first day was highlighted by a Main Street parade of antique sheep wagons. Nearly every wagon had been the canvas-covered, 11-by-6-foot first home of an immigrant Basque couple. Many wagons were hauled down from the nearby <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> mountains where they are still used every summer as a shepherd's home while tending flocks. The last day of the gathering was devoted to God in the morning and dogs in the afternoon. An outdoor mass in a log band shell, the altar decorated with whiskey barrels overflowing with petunias, was partly conducted in Basque. A brass band, its members dressed in red, white and green costumes, trumpeted fanfares to herald highlights. Next came a picnic and a sheepherding contest to choose the best work dog. <PERSON> Dollie </PERSON> <PERSON> Iberlin </PERSON>, in her book `` The Basque Web,'' wrote of her husband <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s and his people's heritage: `` God was there every Sunday and always the sheep, the sheep. The yearly cycles of shearing, lambing, docking, trailing, shipping and breeding of sheep structured their lives. Money came in only twice a year; but love, laughter, and practical duties filled their lives. Their heritage left to their children ... is impressive.''

 A diamond, the largest flawless stone and second-largest diamond in the world, goes on sale 10 days from now in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, probably to fetch the largest price ever at auction.

 It came from the earth into unknown hands perhaps five to 10 years ago, crusted, dirty, with no hint to the untrained eye of the golden heart inside. It was likely born in the depths of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, no one knows when, of demonical, prehistoric fire and pressure. Now it has been denuded of the weathered coating and imperfections that cloaked its beauty, and on Oct. 19, at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the highest bidder will own a flawless, golden diamond of 407.48 carats, the largest flawless diamond in the world, the second-largest diamond in human hands, worth whatever it will bring, probably more than $ 20 million. Its recent history is a mystery. Someone in <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or somewhere found it, brought it out and sold it to someone else. It passed from knowing hand to knowing hand. `` It was mined by someone, someone who found the piece of rock, only one person,'' says <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Curiel </PERSON>, the dapper 39-year-old Frenchman who heads <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s jewelry department in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Then it went out of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, either by a private route or through <ORGANIZATION> DeBeers </ORGANIZATION>, the huge diamond trust, or through another person. `` There must have been an intermediary,'' <PERSON> Curiel </PERSON> says. The present owners will not even tell <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s how they got it or how much they paid. <PERSON> Curiel </PERSON> will not say how much it is insured for. `` Why $ 20 million?'' <PERSON> Curiel </PERSON> says. `` I do n't know. The most expensive diamond ever sold was about $ 10 million, but it was an 85-carat stone. This is not a white stone -LRB- which the previous record-holder was -RRB-, so you ca n't really compare it.'' The world's largest diamond, the 530.20 carat <PERSON> Cullinan </PERSON> I, `` The Great Star of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' is set in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sceptre </ORGANIZATION>, part of the Crown Jewels, and therefore out of circulation, on display at The Tower of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` We do n't believe the <PERSON> Cullinan </PERSON> is flawless,'' <PERSON> Curiel </PERSON> says. It was cut in 1911, and the field of gemology was more art than science. Now things are more precise, more scientific. `` Nobody knows whether it is flawless or not.'' <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s counts on the fingers of both hands the number of potential buyers, those with the money and the reason to sport such a stone. It will be, <PERSON> Curiel </PERSON> says, `` someone who wants the prestige of buying the largest flawless stone in the world ... either for a corporate seal, or a scepter or for a tiara. I do not believe it will be purchased by someone who will give it to his wife.'' It will be a symbol of status. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s has taken the diamond on the road to show prospective buyers, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` I do n't travel with it,'' <PERSON> Curiel </PERSON> says. `` I would be an obvious target.'' So this queen of gems travels with a personal carrier, sometimes an armored service or in the company of three or four armed guards. It depends where it is going. `` Every country poses a different problem,'' <PERSON> Curiel </PERSON> says. Not so in the secure heart of <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Curiel </PERSON>, who is also an executive vice president and director of the firm, casually interrupts a phone conversation and calls out, `` <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>, the diamond please.'' It arrives in <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>'s hand in a small black box that does n't fit together properly. Inside it is nestled in a piece of often-used tissue paper. It took three years, beginning in 1985, to cut the diamond from the 890-carat stone in which it was mined. Diamond cutters do not work by the hour, but by the carat. An artisan, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaab </PERSON>, began the job. He worked for six months determining the most economical shape, a shield or `` triolette,'' a complicated, asymmetrical triangular design more than 2 inches long, about one and one-third inches wide and a fraction over an inch deep. <PERSON> Curiel </PERSON>, who will conduct the auction, points to a one quarter-inch facet and says, `` It probably took a month to make that one cut.'' The cutting was finished this year by another artisan, <PERSON> Hy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, and the diamond drew crowds on exhibit at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The final product fits easily in the palm of one's hand and weighs about as much as a cigarette lighter. The current owners, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> jewelry dealers <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Glick </PERSON>, in partnership with the <ORGANIZATION> Zale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a retail chain headquartered in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, do n't explain their reluctance to reveal the diamond's origins. April of this year was a big month for diamonds. On April 19, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s auctioned off an 85.91-carat white diamond for $ 9,310,000. A day later <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s sold a 52.59-carat stone for $ 7,480,000, or a record per-carat price of $ 142,000 for a white diamond. At that price per carat the new diamond would run over $ 57 million. But, as <PERSON> Curiel </PERSON> says, they ca n't be compared. In April 1987, he sold a rare red diamond, weighing less than a carat for $ 880,000, an all-time per-carat record. Some 300 people will witness the auction, but the principal bidders will probably be absent, relying on agents or phoned bids. Understandable. They do n't like that kind of celebrity, people following them around, trying to sell them something else. But in all likelihood the buyer's name will be made public, <PERSON> Curiel </PERSON> says. `` There's always a chance that the buyer's name will become eternally linked to the gem _ it's an opportunity for immortality.''

 Bees are buzzing around the <LOCATION> Griffith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> carousel where they are filming the first episode of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Something Is Out There,'' a series about a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> homicide detective and a beautiful alien from another planet who investigate things that go bump in the night <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> is the detective and <PERSON> Maryam </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Abo </PERSON> is the alien, reprising their roles from the hit miniseries last May that gave birth to the series. But the outer-space monster that D'Abo chased in the miniseries has yielded to more down-to-earth, although equally spooky, evils. `` It's not going to be a creature of the week show,'' <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> says. `` And it's not going to be another cop show or romantic comedy. It'll have a supernatural element and our cases will be a little more eerie.'' The gaiety at the carousel is interrupted by the screams of a young girl. She jumps off a horse as <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON>, flashing his detective's badge, tries to stop her. She kicks him on the shin and runs off into the park. `` In this episode the girl has telekinetic powers and she knows something is going to happen,'' <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> explains. `` Two renegade intelligence agents are after her because her father invented a serum that gives her these powers. They want to sell it to the highest bidder.'' <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> plays Detective <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON> and D'Abo is Ta ` In the fall series she will be earthbound, but is still an alien with special powers. The miniseries, which topped <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Bourne Identity'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial'' in the ratings, is now being packaged as a movie for theatrical release in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and for videocassette release here. `` There's going to be a lot of humor between this man and woman,'' <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> says. `` She'll help him solve the cases with her power. There'll be bantering and some sexual tension between them, but that's it. They'll never get together.'' <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> shoos away a honey bee attempting to take a swig of his soft drink. Then, director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Colla </PERSON> -LRB- who also did the miniseries -RRB- calls him back for another take beneath the roof of the merry-go-round, which was built in 1932 for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s Fair and moved to <LOCATION> Griffith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in 1936 Later, in his trailer dressing room, <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> says, `` <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON> is a guy with a cynical sense of humor. He can make fun of himself, but he wo n't let anyone else make fun of him. He's a diamond in the rough. We're trying to do a different show. Every kind of story you can do in a cop show's been done. So, we're taking a risk. It's a new arena and it could be a hit or a miss.'' <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> has had his share of misses. He starred in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` C.A.T. Squad,'' which came a cropper two years ago. He also stars in the forthcoming `` C.A.T. Squad II <PERSON> Python </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>.'' He was also in such movies as `` Monsignor'' and `` Windows.'' `` I've been in this business a long time and I've never been in a hit,'' he says. `` I have been in a series of flops. When this came on last May I never thought it would do as well as it did. It was up against some tough competition, but it came out on top. I was pleasantly surprised.'' Before the miniseries came on people compared it to `` V,'' which became an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> series in 1984-85 after two successful miniseries. It was about the conquest of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> by lizard-like space aliens. `` This is much more accessible to the audience than ` V,''' <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> says. `` The audience is going to like this guy and girl. After people saw the miniseries they started comparing it to ` Moonlighting.' I think it stands on its own.'' <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> met <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> when she played his girlfriend in the miniseries. `` I'm absolutely crazy about her,'' he says. `` It's the best relationship I've been in. I did n't want to be in a relationship with an actress, but when I met her that was it.'' <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, but attended <ORGANIZATION> Midwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` It was a cultural shock,'' he says, `` but a great learning experience. I had to get away from my roots and find out who I was.'' He began acting his sophomore year of college and after graduation worked in many regional theaters in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> admits he was discouraged by the flops in his career. `` But about four or five years ago I decided I was n't going to blame myself for it,'' he says. `` I worked hard to change myself. I stopped drinking. I started working with more unfortunate people. I donated my time to help other people. I took therapy. And when I did that, little by little it changed me and I had a better life.''

 When <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Curlee </PERSON> and her two sisters used to sing as the <ORGANIZATION> Curlee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sisters </ORGANIZATION>, their mother had dreams of their becoming as famous as <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Welk </PERSON>'s Lennon Sisters. But it was the'60s and girl groups were passe. But one decade's passe is a later decade's nostalgia. Today <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Curlee </PERSON> is one of the four singing actresses appearing in `` The Taffetas,'' an off-Broadway hit at the Cherry Lane Theater. They play four rather naive, singing sisters living in <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, in the 1950s and making an out-of-town appearance as a group called the Taffetas. `` We're not a slick girls group,'' <PERSON> Curlee </PERSON> says. `` We have n't gotten that far. <PERSON> Curlee </PERSON>, at 34, and her `` sister'' Taffetas are too young to remember when songs like `` Mockin' Bird Hill'' -LRB- <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON> -RRB-, `` Ricochet'' -LRB- <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> -RRB-, `` Mr. <PERSON> Sandman </PERSON>'' -LRB- Chordettes -RRB-, `` Dedicated to the One I Love'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Shirelles </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, and `` Sincerely'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> McGuire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sisters </ORGANIZATION> cover of a Moonglows hit -RRB-, were on `` The Hit Parade.'' Audiences at the Cherry Lane range from people who do remember those songs with nostalgia to younger listeners curious about what was pop just before rock to girls admiring the Taffetas' prom dresses. The other Taffetas are <PERSON> Tia </PERSON> <PERSON> Speros </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> has sung in a show set in the 1940s, playing <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> of the Andrews Sisters On TV she has been <PERSON> Angela </PERSON>, a rich girl who got into drugs, on `` Another World'' and <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>, a mean high-school cheerleader, on `` As the World Turns.'' <PERSON> Curlee </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, became a Taffeta just before the Cherry Lane Theater opening in August, when <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> left to play Grizabella, the `` Memory'' cat, in `` Cats'' in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Curlee </PERSON> had been understudying five cats in `` Cats'' on Broadway for two years. `` The Taffetas'' is the brainchild of <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who's onstage playing piano at the Cherry Lane with two other musicians. Researching'50s music, he was amazed to find <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>'s record of `` A Bushel and a Peck.'' `` I thought my mother made that up to put the kids to sleep.'' Now he's working on four-part harmony for `` <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baby </LOCATION>,'' an <PERSON> Eartha </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitt </PERSON> hit 34 years before <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> recorded it, to insert into the show before Christmas. He thought of the name, a takeoff on the Chiffons, then the image, the McGuire Sisters. `` They captured what the'50s singing group was like _ gorgeous, great teeth and smiles and they sang incredibly,'' he says. The Taffetas are n't singing note-for-note the'50s arrangements. `` But if you do n't hear something that sounds like what you remember,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> says, `` you ca n't really remember it.'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> also picked the Taffetas' hometown, <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, a place none of the quartet ever has been. He visited there, for journalism seminars, from his high school in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The Taffetas have been written about recently on Page 1 of the <ORGANIZATION> Muncie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, under the headline, `` Natives of a Town They Never Knew.'' `` We're giving everybody from <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION> free tickets to see the show, if they can prove it,'' <PERSON> Curlee </PERSON> says. In college, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> studied music education, then did some acting and musical directing. He moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> thinking he'd pursue both. He included on his resume his <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> musical directing credits. He got offered musical directing jobs, often for industrial shows. `` I'd build shows from scratch. They would spend $ 50,000 and it would be performed one night. I did a show that was $ 100,000 a few years ago.'' Trying for a reuseable, cheaper approach, he put together the Taffetas. `` We kept showcasing it for people who book those things. The amount of people we fed and gave booze to over a two-year period _ I'd like to spend that much on parties for my friends sometime. They'd say, ` When you've got reviews, let us know.''' So <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> took the Taffetas into two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cabarets, Do n't Tell Mama and Westbeth Cabaret Theater `` I thought we'd put a nice little brochure together. Instead we got fabulous reviews. We were chased by producers wanting us off-Broadway. We made the best choice. We took <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitelaw </PERSON>.'' Since `` The Taffetas'' is an off-Broadway hit, there are offers for industrial shows, conventions and parties. Asked what they think about the 1950s songs they're singing, <PERSON> Speros </PERSON> says, `` They have an underlying sweet, smiling quality.'' <PERSON> Curlee </PERSON> says, `` They sang much slower then. My inner tempo as a 34-year-old woman is to lock in much faster.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> says, `` Being slower, you can understand the lyrics. Not having angst in the voice makes a more vulnerable, innocent and youthful sound. I think this music grows on you. For me, it does.'' <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON> says, `` I love the lyrics. I think ` I Cried' -LRB- Patti Page -RRB- is one of the most beautiful songs. It pulls on those heartstrings.'' The Taffetas were photographed with <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON> when she sang recently at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> nightspot. `` She does a lot of our songs,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> says with a smile.

 While some demonstrators shout `` Yankee go home,'' vastly more Asians want just the opposite _ a continued strong economic and political <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presence in their region. A pervading fear is that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> indeed might adopt a new isolationist mood, leaving <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> prey to more agressive and military powers. Despite sharp anti-American protests in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and festering disputes on trade issues, experts and officials believe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has rarely enjoyed such broadly based popularity in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> as it does today. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Chinese leaders huddle regularly. Traditionally prickly relations with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> are on the mend, and onetime enemy <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is keen to establish diplomatic ties. On many days Filipino demonstrators are outnumbered by those lined up at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> for visas to emigrate or study in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, tens of thousands of demonstrators trying to topple an authoritarian government have applauded the American flag in rallies outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Published material and interviews by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> with officials in various <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries indicate that a large cross-section of Asians are apprehensive that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and foreseeably <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, would fill the vacuum left by a shrinking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in the western <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> is vital to the security and stability of non-communist <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> ... and is very much in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s national interest,'' said Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. Although speaking shortly after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat was expelled last May for allegedly meddling in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s affairs, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> described <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> power as `` benevolent, benign.'' In a sharp turnabout from the Vietnam War era, American officialdom finds itself trying to persuade Asians that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not becoming isolationist-minded. `` I think the unease is with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> will and commitment: ` Does the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> really have the will to hold tough and stand?''' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> said in an interview. Some senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy makers privately express disappointment that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not taking full advantage of pro-American sentiments in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. They maintain that private American business does n't try hard enough in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> markets, that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers create a backlash by pushing protectionist trade legislation and that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> does n't spend enough to promote general American interests. `` We have to grasp the moment,'' <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> said. What also worries <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is that the two hotbeds of anti-Americanism in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> happen to be strategically vital. In the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, demonstrators demand the ouster of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest military bases outside the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, radicals blame the division of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula on the presence of 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in their country. `` If Filipinos want to grow up they have to slay the American father image,'' said Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. He was referring to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' former status as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colony. Last year, President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> discontinued Philippine-American Friendship Day on July 4 as a national holiday. Analysts generally agree the majority in both the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> remain staunchly pro-American but say this sentiment could erode if opponents are effective in propagating their message and moderates find the anti-American theme politically useful. Although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also stations troops in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, irritants in that bilateral relationship are largely economic. `` Our leverage with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is declining so we have to use Japan-bashing to achieve things, and this is causing a backlash,'' said <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Calder </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> specialist at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Although he and others characterize all-around ties as sound, Japanese farmers have staged demonstrations and burned an American-made car _ one cattle farmer even committed suicide _ to protest the opening of their market to far cheaper <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef and oranges. Americans in turn, see Japanese imports swelling an already large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market absorbs more than half the manufactured goods of non-communist <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Eastern <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> accounted for $ 107 billion, or 62 percent, of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit last year. Given such high economic stakes, countries such as <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> can be badly hurt by protectionist <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legislation. Conversely, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> becomes a highly favored friend when a country's products flow unhindered into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shopping malls and showrooms. Anti-American feeling appears to be proportional to the intensity of direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement, especially military, in an <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> country.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> ascribed the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> demonstrations to `` Korean nationalism reacting to the visible presence of another nation's soldiers. This sort of problem is difficult to eradicate entirely.'' However, this very military muscle is welcomed by much of the rest of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which continues to have shaky relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> while building what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats call a `` solid, mature, many-sided'' relationship with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is entrenched at <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Cam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, its largest military base outside the homeland, and enjoys a close alliance with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has also made political and economic inititatives since 1986 when General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> declared in <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> that the `` <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is also an Asian Pacific country.'' Recently he offered to pull out of <PERSON> Cam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> terminated its air and naval stations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` The real, long-term and very difficult obstacle to remove is not the American bases but the Soviet bases and military alliance,'' the head of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Noordin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sopiee </PERSON>, wrote this year. Asians are also noting that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has become the world's fifth largest spender on defense and is taking a more aggressive role in international politics. In countries like <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, Japanese atrocities in World War II are far from forgotten. `` What kind of a leader is <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> when it worries more about selling transistors than human rights?'' asked an <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> intellectual, remarking that unlike the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, the Japanese mission in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> shuns opposition figures for fear of losing the government's favor _ and business. <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Calder </PERSON> said, `` In comparison with the Japanese juggernaut the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> superpower is more appealing to many Asians... There are a lot of people after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> who see the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> as more distant, the lesser evil if you will. They balance the generosity of the Americans with the mercantilism, the strategic approach of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' To offset what many Asians call <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s `` economic invasion,'' they urge the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to increase its trade, aid and investment in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The Japanese have outpaced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in all three in recent years. Official development assistance by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries in 1987 was $ 3.4 billion in contrast to less than $ 900 million from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy makers also say the democratic wave that has in recent years swept the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and now <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, along with the economic failures of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s communist societies, are in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest. The emerging democracies, they say, are not only closer to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> system and spirit but also eliminate the earlier dilemma of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> propping up right-wing, anti-communist dictators. This had been a source of anti-Americanism in the past.

<TEXT>
 After centuries at the center of a tug-of-war between <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, this city nestled on a tranquil river now harmonizes <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> joie de vivre with German efficiency. `` <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> is a symbol,'' says Deputy Mayor <PERSON> Germain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>, who is in charge of the celebrations marking the city's 2,000 th anniversary this year `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which often fought over this place, are now the countries leading us toward a united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> will spend four days, beginning Oct. 8, in this city between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Vosges </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. He will address the entity that symbolizes <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> unity, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which meets in the chambers of the Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In coming to <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, the pope will not find a better place to illustrate reconciliation _ an appropriate theme at a time when the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the area is shaken by a traditionalist schism. Memories of the Nazi occupation are fresh enough to cause <PERSON> Strasbourgeois </PERSON>, as the local people are called, to feel passionately French. Taxi drivers boast that the French national anthem, the <PERSON> Marseillaise </PERSON>, was written here. Shopkeepers mention that <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonaparte </PERSON> came here to go to school. The city is still the biggest university town in eastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. They mention less often, however, that <PERSON> Goethe </PERSON> studied here, too, or that <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutenberg </PERSON> spent a decade in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> inventing the intricate press on which he later produced his Bible, the first book printed with movable type. For centuries <LOCATION> Alsace </LOCATION> and the neighboring region of <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> were part of an independent republic bordering the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. From 1870 to 1945, the region passed regularly back and forth between German and French hands. The bicultural history is felt today in nearly every aspect of daily life _ from the bildings on the street to the music on the radio. Even the names of city streets reveal <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>'s seesaw history. In 1871, Avenue <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> became <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilhelmstrasse </PERSON>, after the Germans moved in. That was changed to <ORGANIZATION> Boulevard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republique </ORGANIZATION> after World War I. Then for some years it was known as <ORGANIZATION> Adolf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hitler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strasse </ORGANIZATION> until it was given its current name, Avenue <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>, when the French reclaimed the city at the end of World War II. The avenue today is filled with a blitzkrieg of German tourists who arrive by the busload in this city of 400,000, just two miles from the West German border. They are outnumbered only by French sightseers who stroll through the narrow, medieval streets of half-timbered houses, past outdoor cafes and hidden courtyards and over picturesque bridges on the Ill River. Many people speak both German and French, and older people often are fluent in Alsatian, the regional linguistic hybrid. The intertwining of cultures has produced a cuisine that melds German ingredients and French know-how to cook up regional dishes like choucroute _ sauerkraut and smoked meat cooked in wine. Kronenbourg beer is brewed here. Rhine wines, in a dry French style, are produced nearby. Cuisines and languages have blended with ease; the region's two religions have not. Unlike most of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which is 80 percent <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Alsace-Lorraine </LOCATION> is half <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION>. `` When a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> girl married a Catholic boy here it used to be considered a disgrace. Except for a very few small villages, it's not that way anymore,'' said City Councilman <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roos </PERSON>, whose father was a medical officer in the German army in World War I and in the French army in World War II. <PERSON> Roos </PERSON> said the two groups now live in harmony. The discord these days is within the Catholic church itself. In June, a long-brewing dispute between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> traditionalists culminated in the excommunication of rebel Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>. It was the first schism within the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in more than a century and has led to repeated calls by the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> hierarchy for unity in the face of the challenge posed by <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and his flock. As he did on a trip to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> two years ago, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is likely to stress loyalty to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on this visit, which begins at <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>'s massive cathedral, a dramatic setting for the pope's first speech Built between 1190 and 1489 by master French and Rhineland craftsmen, the pink sandstone cathedral rises 465 feet and was the highest building in the Christian world until a century ago. Inside is an astronomical clock of ingenious works.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Stealing Home''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 From <PERSON> Elia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazan </PERSON>'s `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boorman </PERSON>'s `` Hope and Glory,'' remembrance of childhood has made stirring films. They require selective memory and an artistic soul. Those factors, unfortunately, are missing in `` Stealing Home.'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaupmann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Addis </PERSON>, sitcom writers who graduated to such features as `` Back to School'' and `` The Couch Trip,'' thought it would be a dandy idea to write a movie script based on their experiences of growing up in the 1960s _ not only write it, but direct it. Together. Despite good performances and one that is exceptional, `` Stealing Home'' becomes a mishmash, chaotic in structure and full of momentous scenes that do n't come off. The title itself is a misguided attempt at allegory. The biggest moment in <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>'s young life was stealing home in a crucial baseball game. The moment is replayed at the end of the film to illustrate the regeneration of the adult <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>, now trying for a minor league comeback. Even with all the slo-mo effects and the portentous music, the scene has no more impact than a third-base bunt. The movie opens with <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, the adult <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, on the skids. We know he's on the skids because he is swilling booze with a bimbo in a third-rate motel and sports a Don Johnson stubble. He learns that his boyhood friend and lover, <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> -RRB-, has committed suicide and has designated him to dispose of her ashes. Thus begins <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>'s pilgrimage to his old home grounds and into his past. This requires a procession of flashbacks to <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>'s happy family, his baseball prowess, his father's untimely death, the strong friendship with the eccentric <PERSON> Katie </PERSON>. There might have been a heartwarming film in these reminiscences, but the time frames are juxtaposed confusingly, and there are even flashbacks within flashbacks. The star of the film, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, appears in about a half-hour of footage, the teen-age <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> being played quite effectively by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> has the role of her young life, and she plays it brilliantly. She captures the quicksilver qualities of <PERSON> Katie </PERSON>, dominating the screen whenever she appears. Within the constraints of his role, <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> performs ably, but the reasons for his torment are never made clear. The <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> release was produced by <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Moonjean </PERSON>. The rating is PG-13 for language and sexual content.

 `` Broadcast News'' -LRB- CBS-Fox Video; VHS @ Beta, $ 89.98; Rated R -RRB- One advantage in seeing `` Broadcast News'' at home is the opportunity to give the film a more satisfying ending than the feeble conclusion reached by director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. Just stop when you've had enough _ at least two good opportunities will arise _ and savor the satisfaction of saving a film in the cutting room. For most of its length, though, `` Broadcast News'' is a witty and often hilarious human comedy set in the high-pressure world of network journalism. This highly praised film inexplicably was snubbed at the Academy Award ceremonies, after winning seven nominations. However, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> deservedly won best-actress awards from critics in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> play bright, dedicated and tough news professionals who worry about the inroads of fluffy feature stories and blow-dried airheads on the anchor desk. We know they are the very best of journalists because they say so, rather often. Their media <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> is invaded by a blow-dried, airhead snake named <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Grunick </PERSON> -LRB- William Hurt -RRB-. However, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> establishes himself as a sympathetic figure. He's the only character who appears to have any humility, admitting that he's no genius and forthrightly asking help from <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> -LRB- Hunter -RRB-. What he knows is how to look good and sound smart, and he generously offers tips on anchoring to <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ perhaps knowing that the neurotic <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> is no competition. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> runs at such a high pitch that she often loses perspective. When her boss sarcastically tells her that it must be great to always be the smartest person in the room, she takes him seriously. `` No, it's awful,'' she sobs. Though <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> and Hurt turn in first-class performances, this is <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s movie and it runs on her energy. It's not just the two guys in the film who will fall in love with her. _ By <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Switching Channels'' -LRB- RCA @ <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>; VHS @ Beta, $ 89.95; Rated PG -RRB- `` Switching Channels,'' a film of romantic antics in a satellite TV station, had the bad luck of appearing in movie houses last March several months after `` Broadcast News,'' a far better satire of the TV news business. But let's be fair. Do n't compare `` Switching Channels'' to `` Broadcast News,'' or to classics on the same newsroom theme from which it was derived: `` The Front Page'' and `` His Girl Friday.'' No, `` Switching Channels'' is so silly, predictable, miscast and lost in its lame attempt at broad comedy that a more apt comparison would be to `` Francis the Talking Mule.'' <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> plays an ace reporter at a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> TV station. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> is her boss and ex-husband. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> takes a vacation and meets <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeve </PERSON>, a wealthy <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> manufacturer of sporting goods including, ha ha, jockstraps. They fall in love, and <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> agrees to go East and leave <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> and the news biz behind. Wily <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> is having none of that. He hooks Turner into covering one last big story, the execution of a convicted cop killer, played by <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. When it's all over, and <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> must decide between <PERSON> Reeve </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, the only question becomes how could someone supposedly so smart wind up torn between such a pair of shnooks? And do you really care which she choses? Turner does the most with limp material. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, usually very good in such broad comedy, never gets started here. <PERSON> Reeve </PERSON>, who showed flashes of drollery as <PERSON> Superman </PERSON>, is miserably miscast as a foppish, brainless rich boy who's scared of elevators. Director <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotcheff </PERSON> seems willing to let the actors drift and mug pretty much as they will. `` Switching Channels'' is rated PG for occasional tart language. _ By <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitgang </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Chimes of Freedom'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> This extended play recording was released to coincide with the six-week Human Rights Now! global tour now under way featuring <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, Sting, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> and a host of other musicians, with some of the EP's proceeds donated to the human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. The disc's four songs were all recorded live during <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>'s 1988 `` Tunnel of Love'' tour; the opening `` Tougher Than the Rest'' already appears on that album. This live version, recorded at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sports </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arena </LOCATION>, has a slower, more country-tinged tempo to it, and wraps up nicely with fine harmonica work by <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>. `` Be True,'' recorded at the <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, is what <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> fans would call typical `` B Side <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>.'' The artist has a penchant for putting catchy, danceable tunes on the flip sides of his singles that are n't included on any album. Backed, as always, by the hard-rocking E Street Band, <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> croons to the fictional heroine, `` You be true to me and I'll be true to you.'' Is n't it kind of tacky for <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, whose split with wife <PERSON> Julianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> made all the gossip columns during his tour, to include this song here? Incidentally, vocals by back-up singer <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Scialfa </PERSON>, with whom <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> is now involved, are far more prominent on this EP than on any previous recording. `` Chimes of Freedom,'' the third song, is alone worth buying this EP for. The <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> protest song is the perfect anthem for the <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> tour, and <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>'s rendering, recorded in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, is faithful to the original. The artist, whose lyrics were often compared to <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>'s early in his career, proves he can salute his influences and still add something uniquely his own to their songs. By far the most ambitious of the four songs is <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>'s acoustic version of `` Born to Run,'' also recorded in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> That song was the artist's signature tune before being replaced by `` Born in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>,'' and it had the raw power of a motorcycle opened up at full throttle. However, <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, who has proven himself an accomplished accoustic artist with `` <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>'' and several cuts on `` Tunnel of Love,'' falls flat here. His vocals meander all over the place like a <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> prose-poem and the impression is one of the motorcycle run out of gas and being pushed along like a scooter. _ By <PERSON> Geneva </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Still Live'' -LRB- ECM -RRB- _ <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Trio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jazz </PERSON> pianist <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON>, who unlike many of his electronic-minded contemporaries still plays only the piano, has never sounded better than in this two-disc live recording. Communicating intuitively with bassist <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Peacock </PERSON> and drummer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> DeJohnette </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON> combined his signature moody chord voicings with sharp improvising in a collection of jazz standards for a concert audience in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He took the songs' familiar melodies and stretched, twisted and bent them in fascinating ways. The listener is never lost, though, and he ends each journey back at the beginning, exhilarated and ready for another. <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON>'s interpretation of `` My Funny Valentine'' was understated and sensitive, while `` When I Fall in Love'' became a ballad with a bit of an attitude. `` Come Rain or Come Shine'' had just the right bluesy edge. Only `` The Song Is You,'' a Kern-Hammerstein composition, failed to achieve a groove that matched its length, nearly 17 minutes. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON> is an intelligent pianist who has done his share of experimenting. `` Still Live,'' with its classic tunes played on acoustic piano, should give purists plenty to cheer about. _ <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer

 `` Day By Day'' -LRB- EMI-Manhattan -RRB- _ <PERSON> Najee </PERSON> <PERSON> Najee </PERSON> sets a mellow groove on his second LP, `` Day By Day,'' and never strays very far from the course. The album is always tasteful, with the New Yorker's soaring saxophone solos taking center stage and showing his jazz and rhythm and blues influences. Back-up singers dart in and out of the arrangements, keeping things moving along smoothly. But the album tends to be swallowed up by its tastefulness, and often fades into backround music. While this album can be the perfect accompaniment to a romantic dinner, it unfortunately is just as appropriate later on when the dishes are being washed. Only `` <PERSON> Najee </PERSON>'s Nasty Groove,'' a funky track dominated by drums and synthesizer, breaks the mold. Anyone in the market for some easy listening jazz could do worse than this album. But those looking for something more, well, inspiring, would do well to keep on looking. _ By <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sigourney </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> has been known as a courageous actress. But as the late naturalist <PERSON> Dian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fossey </PERSON> in `` Gorillas in the Mist,'' she has outdone herself. In earlier films she battled outer space demons -LRB- `` Alien,'' `` Aliens'' -RRB-, revolution -LRB- `` The Year of Living Dangerously'' -RRB- and evil spirits -LRB- `` Ghostbusters'' -RRB-. The new movie shows her in conditions of genuine peril: working with silverback gorillas in the mountain jungles of <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> without a double or net _ nothing between her and a beast that could crush her in an instant. <PERSON> Fossey </PERSON> was murdered in <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> in her sleep. Her colleagues, who considered her an eccentric, said she had angered local residents with her aggressive efforts to restrict poaching. <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, 38, was born into the entertainment business. Her father is <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> -LRB- Pat -RRB- <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> president considered to be the architect of modern television. Her mother is the former actress <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Inglis </PERSON>. After <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drama </ORGANIZATION>, she worked her way from off-Broadway to films. On a recent visit from her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> home, she talked about her African experience in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Q. You do n't pick easy pictures, do you? A. -LRB- laughing -RRB- That's probably true. My father says that if I open a script and it takes place in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> with a lot of huskies and I fall through the ice, I'll probably do it instead of a lovely picture on the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>. Q. Did you know about <PERSON> Dian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fossey </PERSON> and her work? A. I had gotten her book when it first came out. I had also been at <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION> when they started that human-primate program where you could live with an ape in your trailer and do your thesis on it. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodall </PERSON> had come and spoken to us. After I read <PERSON> Dian </PERSON>'s book -LRB- `` Gorillas in the Mist'' -RRB- I thought, `` They ca n't make a picture out of this; she is too difficult a woman to be portrayed on the screen.'' I also thought logistically it would be a nightmare. How could you possibly create the whole atmosphere of the gorillas? Q. Were you involved in the joining of Universal and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- which had competing projects -RRB-? A. No. I was approached by each studio separately. By the time -LRB- producer -RRB- <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Glimcher </PERSON> approached me for Universal, I said, `` Arnie, I do n't want to get involved with a picture that's not going to happen.'' I thought they would knock each other out. Q. Once the deal was made, were n't you overwhelmed by the danger involved? A. Not really. I was reading a lot of <PERSON> Dian </PERSON>'s papers and rereading her book, and it seemed that she was often threatened by gorillas, but they never actually hurt her. It was all a question of getting to know each other. I did n't see why they would feel animosity toward me. That was a lucky choice on my part. I do n't think it would be wise go in and to work with animals without having previously reassured yourself that you would be all right. I was intimidated by trying to gather all the information about <PERSON> Dian </PERSON>. So much of it was conflicting. And so much of it was hearsay. She had a very negative reputation within her field, and she was considered to be a very difficult woman. I heard people say some pretty hard things about her. And some very loving things as well. Q. What kind of a person was she? A. She was a mass of opposites, I think. Everything you can say about <PERSON> Dian </PERSON>, the opposite is probably true. She loved people, she loved partying. ... On the other hand she shunned people, she preferred to be with animals. She lived up in this isolated place, tramping around in mud, yet she loved to go out in fancy clothes. She always slept with curlers in her hair, even when she lived up on top of the mountain. She is such an amazing collection of different things. I guess I grew very fond of her. I was lucky to have access to her letters and her camp notes through a colleague of hers. She really put herself in those letters. I developed such an admiration for her thoroughness, her commitment, her humor _ she was always making jokes about herself. She had a wicked sense of humor, and I hope that comes across in the film. Q. Did you train for the rigors of the location? A. In the press release, it says I ran up these volcanic mountains in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. -LRB- laughing -RRB- I do n't know where they got that. I did walk up a hill behind my parents-in-law's house in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> every morning for about two weeks. I do n't think any of us could have gotten in shape for -LRB- the location -RRB-. You had to get used to the altitude and slowly get used to the climbs. It was difficult for everyone except the Australians; they were very macho about the whole thing. You were in such a beautiful part of the world and you were perhaps going to see gorillas at the end of the climb or you were going to the top of the mountain to shoot a scene. Q. What was your first encounter with the gorillas? A. We did n't think we were going to see gorillas that day. It turned out they were only 5 minutes away from <PERSON> Dian </PERSON>'s camp. We took off through a beautiful forest filled with wild orchids. We heard a great outburst of pock-pock sounds, which is the sound they make beating their chests. I looked up and saw this big gorilla standing halfway up the hill. You're so amazed to suddenly be in their territory; it was like you had walked into another era. I just forgot, I was so entranced. It was like walking into a forest and seeing a unicorn. You forgot your fear, you just went ahead. I went up to where they were all sitting around munching, though I could n't see them. This little gorilla came out to me and sat down and touched my camera. She was very curious, taking me in in a matter-of-fact way. She jumped away after she had visited, and I was agog. It was an indescribable feeling. I just found out last week that that sweet little girl had been caught in a poacher's trap ... and she did n't make it. There are n't many females, and coming from a very good family, she would have been a good mate Q. Were you well-coached on how to behave with the gorillas? A. I kind of learned it as I went along. In the picture are a couple of scary scenes where the silverback comes down right next to me. They all happened the first times we went out. So I was kind of thrown into the deep end.

<TEXT>
 The life's work of sculptor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> has gone on show in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in a comprehensive way that was never managed while he lived. `` We discussed an exhibition with him in 1984 to mark his 90th birthday this year, but he died in 1986. Now this is his memorial,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. The venerable academy, which has been presenting art exhibitions since 1768, has done <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> proud, spreading 112 sculptures and 127 drawings by him through its 12 main galleries to show all the stages of his career. There are Giant abstract bronzes and lifesize human figures in stone that had to be lifted in by crane, and little plaster figures smaller than a hand. His famous drawings of restless sleepers who sought refuge in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> subway to escape bombings in World War II also are shown, along with sketches of coal miners, trees, elephants, sheep, landscapes and ideas for sculpture, often based on bones, stones and bits of wood which he picked up. Dr. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Compton </PERSON>, a British art historian who organized a popular exhibition of <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Chagall </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, spent 15 months arranging the exhibition, which ru a global thing. That's where the ` Small World' concept came from. The album's first single is the brassy `` Perfect World'' written by <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Call </PERSON>, a longtime friend of <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' who used to be in his old country-rock band Clover. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the second single will be an edited version of `` Small World -LRB- Part One -RRB-'' and the instrumental `` Small World -LRB- Part Two -RRB-,'' which features a guest appearance by jazz saxophonist <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Getz </PERSON>. `` I once went to a benefit show with my dad, who's a jazz drummer, and <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> came up and introduced himself to me,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> recalled. `` He said, ` Hey man, why do n't you let me play on some of your stuff? I can play that stuff, too.' Then he gave me a card that said, ` <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Getz </PERSON>: Have Sax, Will Travel.''' Other album cuts are the 1960s-style soul instrumental `` Slammin','' the Cajun-sounding `` Old Antone's'' which features a guest appearance by <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> on accordion, the reggae-tinged love song `` Better Be True'' and the pure reggae jam `` Bobo Tempo.'' `` ` Bobo Tempo' was written by <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> and myself about 13 years ago when we were both in Clover,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` It was for a gig we had in <LOCATION> Bolinas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> ` <PERSON> Bobo </PERSON>' is a nickname for <LOCATION> Bolinas </LOCATION>, which is a nutty place. We used to play out there every so often and there would be huge street parties. `` We wrote the song just for that one gig, just for a laugh really,'' he said. `` On the last day of the `` Fore!'' album sessions -LRB- in 1986 -RRB-, we piled into the studio at midnight and cut that song. The track really held up.'' But not the video, which involves a topless girl, a surfer and a horse on a surfboard and probably will never be commercially released. The cleft-chinned <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, born <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cregg </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, grew up near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and was known as `` <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>'' when he joined Clover in 1972. He changed his name to <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> when he formed his band in late 1979 with <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON>, 35, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, 30, and three members of the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> group Soundhole _ <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, 36, <PERSON> Cipollina </PERSON>, 33, and <PERSON> Colla </PERSON>, 36. The group originally was called <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, but the name was quickly altered to avoid an infringment lawsuit. Their self-titled first album in 1980 went nowhere, but the follow-up `` Picture This'' in 1982 had the Top 10 hits `` Workin' for a Livin''' and `` Do You Believe in Love. Next came the landmark `` Sports'' album, which has sold 9 million copies since its September 1983 release and won several Grammy Awards. It spawned five Top 10 singles including `` I Want a New Drug'' and `` Heart of Rock & amp; Roll.'' In 1985, the band had its first No. 1 single with `` Power of Love,'' an Oscar-nominated song recorded for the year's largest-grossing movie, `` Back to the Future. The tour will take <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and The News well into 1989 and mark their 10th anniversary together. `` I'd be surprised if we're not together another 10 years,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` But it's funny. I still remember when we got our first paycheck from our manager, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. I remember I told him, ` I got to have $ 150 a week for these guys. Otherwise, that's it.' It does n't seem that long ago.''

 The stories of the late <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> are best understood by what's left unsaid. `` She said that it was the mystery, what can not be explained, that made a story endlessly fascinating. She did n't feel that God's ways were cut and dry There were always some surprises in store for everybody,'' said <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, a longtime friend of the late writer who has edited <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s `` Collected Works'' -LRB- Library of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, $ 30 -RRB- The anthology contains the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> native's novels, `` Wise Blood'' and `` The Violent Bear It Away,'' as well as such short stories as `` The Artificial Nigger'' and `` A Good Man Is Hard to Find.'' Also included are essays and a large selection of letters. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> in 1925, the only child of <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, Jr.. She began writing at an early age and set up an attic studio in her home as a work place One of her favorite books growing up was `` The Humorous Tales of <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Poe </PERSON>.'' She contributed cartoons and articles to her high school newspaper and entered <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> for Women in 1942. While in college, she began signing her academic work `` <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>.'' In 1945, she received a scholarship in journalism from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION>. She gained admission to the Writers' Workshop where she began reading the works of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>. `` She was influenced by the Workshop,'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said. `` She learned to spend a certain number of hours writing every day at the same time. She let nothing interfere with it. She was very disciplined about it.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> received a master of fine arts degree in 1947. That same year, she began working on `` Wise Blood,'' her first novel. It took five years and endless revisions before the book was published. `` She certainly suffered writing,'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said. `` Writing was very hard for her. She was a real perfectionist. She discarded more than 2,000 sheets from ` Wise Blood.' `` Ideas explored and abandoned. Working through inferences, working through bad solutions to good solutions. Making that book absolutely her own.'' `` Wise Blood'' tells the story of <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Motes </PERSON>, an intense young man who arrives in a small city in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, determined to form a `` Church Without Christ.'' In a letter dated March 2, 1954, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> gave her own interpretation of `` Wise Blood'': `` ` Wise Blood' is about a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> saint, written from the point of view of a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. ... First you must accept the fact that this book is by someone who believes that there was a fall, has been a Redemption, and will be a judgment. This is what I believe as a Catholic and what I imply that Haze could not get away from. ...'' Man and God. The struggle against grace. Redemption. They were the major themes of <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s stories and her life. `` Redemption and incarnation was central to her,'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said. `` She thought of herself as writing from a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> point of view. This is what all Catholics believe, everything has a meaning.'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> met <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> in 1949. `` She was quite silent. She did n't talk a lot. She listened very carefully. If you were aware, you realized you were in the presence of someone listening and watching very carefully.'' In <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s stories, the eyes are often the most important features of her characters' faces. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> says the same was true for <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> herself. `` She was a young girl, not particularly striking, until you looked at her eyes, which were blue and penetrating. She was a sandy-haired girl. Not somebody you would notice.'' In 1950, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> began to suffer pains and heaviness in her arms and shoulder joints. Although at first she laughed off the symptoms as psychosomatic, an excuse not to write, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was eventually diagnosed as having lupus, an incurable disease that eventually killed her in 1964. `` She bore it very well. We heard no complaints. She was quite funny about it,'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said. `` She had no idea what it was at first. When she learned how serious it was, she must have been shocked. Her father had died of the same disease. He died when she was 15.'' Despite her weakened condition, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> continued to work until her death. She completed a second novel, published two collections of short stories and was a prolific letter writer. She moved back to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in 1950 and lived in <LOCATION> Milledgeville </LOCATION> with her mother for the rest of her life. `` She believed in a character's capacity to change with grace,'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said. `` She lived in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, which was largely Protestant. There were a number of do-it-yourself religions. She was fascinated by what they would come up with.'' In a 1957 essay, `` The Church and the Fiction Writer,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> summed up how religion shaped her writing: `` The Catholic writer, in so far as he has the mind of the Church, will feel life from the standpoint of the central Christian mystery; that it has, for all its horror, been found by God to be worth dying for. `` When people have told me that because I am a Catholic, I can not be an artist, I have to reply, ruefully, that because I am a Catholic, I can not afford to be less than an artist.'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was concerned with `` durable matters.'' `` These are the great questions that have concerned serious artists throughout history,'' she said.

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rising country music performer <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> says his career is just getting started even though he's been singing on the road for 18 years The 33-year-old singer hit the top of the country music charts in August with the single `` Do n't Close Your Eyes.'' The album of the same name has been in the Top 10. `` We're at the point where all systems are go,'' said <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON>, whose honky-tonk style of singing is traditional country music with lyrics embracing pain and joy. `` That sounds odd for somebody who's been on the road for -LRB- about -RRB- 20 years. He was only 15 when he and friend <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, a year older, joined <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Clinch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION>, a bluegrass band. Like <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> eventually became a solo country singer. <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> then survived his remaining, reckless teen-age years and battled a stubborn drinking problem to become one of country music's emerging stars along with <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoakam </PERSON>. `` I've been in this business for a long, long time,'' he said in an interview. `` But from the musical standpoint and a personal standpoint, we're really just at the beginning of my career.'' As a carefree teen in <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, he bought bootleg bourbon, poured it down his thirsty throat and then enjoyed challenging the rural roads at breathless speeds deep in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>. `` Basically when I was growing up, the only thing we did for pastime was go to bootleggers and get something to drink and ride around and drink it and drive around and see how fast you could take those mountain curves,'' he recalled. At age 17, he was in a car with a companion who attempted to round a curve at 120 mph. The car wrecked, killing his friend. `` The doctor told me I came close to breaking my neck,'' said <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON>, who was cut but not hurt in the accident. At 19, he drove off a 120-foot cliff into a frozen river, escaping with a broken collarbone. `` There were a lot more less serious accidents and brushes with the law,'' he said. But always, he was intrigued by music. He played with <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>'s band on the weekends as a teen-ager and later was lead singer for <PERSON> J.D </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> and the New South, a country-bluegrass band. After earning the reputation as a fine musician and singer, he moved to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> in the mid-1980s and landed a recording contract with <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. His hits besides `` Do n't Close Your Eyes'' include `` Miami My <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>,'' `` Ten Feet Away,'' `` Homecoming'63'' and `` Hard Livin.''' He quit drinking in 1987. `` It was a matter of life and death,'' he said. `` If I had n't stopped drinking, I do n't think I'd be alive today I did so many crazy things while drinking.'' <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON>, who is married to Grand Ole Opry singer <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, said his lifestyle intensified his music. `` Not to sound conceited, but I've lived, breathed and cried this music since I was 3 or 4 years old,'' <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> said. `` I take it very seriously. Most of the things I sing in my songs, I've lived `` I do n't wish the others would have to go through that. But I believe I've got the credentials to sing some of the things I sing about where some others do n't. `` The whole deal with my music has been the emotional quality. Songs I do have to strike an emotional chord the first time I sing them. It's not uncommon for me to get so wrapped up in a song that I cry several times when I sing them. That's the difference between my music and some of the other folks.'' His `` Do n't Close Your Eyes'' is about the desperation of love. `` People identified with it. Women seemed to like it and they are a big part of the record-buying public. At shows, people often come up to me and say they feel like it was written about them. `` The melody is real mournful. You can get lost emotionally singing it.'' One of the songs on the album is `` I Never Go Around Mirrors,'' a hit years ago by the late country star <PERSON> Lefty </PERSON> <PERSON> Frizzell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> had a verse added to the song. A few hours before he recorded it, he visited <PERSON> Frizzell </PERSON>'s grave and wept. `` That sounds weird to people. But his music was very important to me growing up,'' <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> said. People do n't understand why I did that, but it meant a lot to me.''

<HEAD>Bone Loss In Women Runners May Be Irreversible, Studies Suggest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Women who exercise enough to disrupt their menstrual periods may suffer an irreversible loss of strength in their bones that could lead to serious fractures or a kind of premature aging, new studies suggest. A 24-year-old woman whose periods are irregular can have the bones of a 50-year-old, said Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesnut </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>. `` Once that loss has occurred, it appears there's very little we can do about it.'' The bone loss can lead to potentially serious spinal fractures and to less serious stress fractures that will keep women from exercising. Women can regain regular periods by reducing their level of exercise, but the bones do n't seem to fully recover, said <PERSON> Chesnut </PERSON>. `` That attitude of some of the women's running gurus has been a bit irresponsible,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` They basically take the cavalier view that, yes, if you stop, everything comes back.'' Recreational athletes, or women who are just trying to stay fit, do n't suffer disruption of periods, <PERSON> Chesnut </PERSON> said. The loss or disruption of menstrual periods, known technically as amenorrhea, occurs most in runners, cyclists, swimmers and ballet dancers, said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Loucks </PERSON>, a research endocrinologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, and an authority on the effect of exercise on women. Researchers do n't know why intense exercise affects menstrual periods. `` Most people think it's probably a combination of factors,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Drinkwater </PERSON>, an exercise and environmental physiologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> who has collaborated with <PERSON> Chesnut </PERSON>. `` How much of the problem is due to exercise, how much is due to nutrition, how much is due to psychological stress _ I do n't think anyone can say with certainty,'' she said. Estimates of the frequency vary widely, said <PERSON> Loucks </PERSON>, with some researchers reporting the problem in only a few percent of athletes and others reporting some disruption of periods in as many as 40 percent of women athletes. <PERSON> Chesnut </PERSON> said the women he and <PERSON> Drinkwater </PERSON> studied did not begin to have problems until they were running 30 miles to 35 miles per week or more. -LRB- That threshhold varies from one individual to the next, he said. -RRB- `` For most women who are only trying to stay in shape, keep their weight down and are running 10 to 20 miles a week, there is no cause for concern as long as their periods remain regular. Exercise is of benefit for a woman at any age so long as it is kept in perspective and does not result in a loss of periods,'' he said. <PERSON> Drinkwater </PERSON> underscored the point. `` We want to be very sure that people do n't get the idea that exercise causes low bone mass. Exercise is beneficial to bone. It's the amenorrhea that's responsible for the decrease of bone density. Women whose periods remain normal can exercise all they like, <PERSON> Drinkwater </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think we want to frighten women away from exercise. What we want to say is _ be sensible in your approach to it.'' <PERSON> Loucks </PERSON> also notes that many things can cause a woman to lose regular menstrual periods. `` A woman who stops menstruating definitely should consult with her gynecologist to rule out other possibilities.'' Getting women athletes to the doctor is n't always easy, however. `` They view themselves as very healthy,'' she said. `` It's very hard to convince them they have a problem.'' In February, one researcher seemed to reinforce that notion by suggesting that women who begin running vigorously before puberty may face a decreased cancer risk later in life. The researcher, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said girls who exercise in elementary school can delay the onset of puberty and may thereby lower their breast cancer risk. <PERSON> Loucks </PERSON> expressed reservations about that view, saying <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON>'s studies of young runners did not document disruptions in menstrual periods `` That is not correct,'' said <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON>. `` We documented them in the greatest detail.'' <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> was more forceful in his criticism: `` It boggles the mind that a reasonable investigator would say something like that. She obviously did not do a study in which she followed women for 40 years, watching them develop or not develop cancer.'' <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON> said many other studies support her findings, and she emphasized that the studies only suggest that delaying puberty would reduce breast cancer risk. `` I have no guarantee that it would,'' she said. The mechanism of bone loss in amenorrheic women is not completely clear, but researchers say they do have a plausible hypothesis. Women who have lost their periods do not produce as much of the female sex hormone estrogen, which leads to calcium loss. So the researchers assume that exercise-related bone loss `` is due to the low estrogen levels in the amenorrheic athletes,'' <PERSON> Loucks </PERSON> said. The same thing happens after menopause, leading to the disorder called osteoporosis, characterized by loss of calcium and fragile bones. <PERSON> Loucks </PERSON> said the underlying disorder that triggers the amenorrhea in exercising women appears to be in the brain, perhaps in the hypothalamus, which controls the body's hormonal system. The hypothalamus sends signals to the pituitary gland, which in turn regulates hormone production. <PERSON> Chesnut </PERSON> and <PERSON> Drinkwater </PERSON> found that women who stop exercising and regain menstrual periods can recover some, but probably not all, of the lost bone. Because bone loss is difficult or impossible to remedy, doctors must focus on prevention, <PERSON> Chesnut </PERSON> said. `` We want to get to these women athletes as soon as possible after amenorrhea occurs, within five to six months certainly, and presumably get them on estrogen replacement, so we can prevent that loss before it's occurred. Because once that loss has occurred, it appears there's very little we can do about it.'' Estrogen may not be suitable for all women, however. Some researchers have linked estrogen treatment _ which is often prescribed for women after menopause _ with an increased risk of cancer, especially breast cancer. Others have found no risk. `` It's something that needs to be studied,'' said <PERSON> Chesnut </PERSON>. `` I would not want all physicians to start putting all of their amenorrheic women on estrogens at the time of amenorrhea.'' Giving calcium alone does not seem to prevent the bone loss, he said. <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> acknowledged that some serious competitive athletes may be unwilling to reduce the intensity of their exercise, but he noted that the bone weakness itself may ultimately force them to stop exercising.

<HEAD>Researchers Disagree Over Reported Genetic Sex Trigger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Now that scientists have found the gene that makes a man a man, some of them would like to see equal rights for the gene that makes a woman a woman. Last winter, Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Whitehead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, announced the discovery of what appears to be the male sex trigger _ a bit of genetic material that separates the boys from the girls. If Page is right, there is one sex switch. Those who get this gene at conception will be boys. Those who do n't will be girls. Page has offered a variety of explanations. But many scientists assume it means there is a gene for masculinity and not for femininity. One researcher who disagrees with this assumption is Dr. <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eicher </PERSON>, a geneticist at the <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. She said she has no quarrel with Page, only with how his discovery is interpretted. `` There is sexism in biology,'' <ORGANIZATION> Eicher </ORGANIZATION> said. `` There is no question about it. It influences the way that biologists approach problems, such as sex determination.'' Even the language of genetics, such as `` dominant'' and `` recessive,'' carry subconscious connotations about the roles of men and women, she said. According to her theory _ and she emphasizes it's only that _ the genetic library of the human race contains two sex genes. One contains the instructions for building boys, the other for making girls. She said many experts believe a maleness gene is necessary to make testis and all the internal and external sex organs of manhood. But for making females, only the absence of this gene is necessary. `` When it comes to sex, the active process is testis and the passive or default process is ovary,'' she said. `` I do n't think nature works by doing nothing. There has to be an active pathway'' to womanhood. Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Harrow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> agrees. `` It may be simple-minded to think that you have a switch to go down one pathway but nothing to go down the other,'' she said. Everybody is born with two strings of genes, known as sex chromosomes, that are called X and Y. Women have two X chromosomes, but men have an X and a Y. Page found the gene that seems to control maleness on the Y chromosome. But he also found a closely related gene on the X chromosome; nobody knows what that gene does. <ORGANIZATION> Eicher </ORGANIZATION> speculates that this is the female gene. The process might work like this: If an egg is fertilized by a `` male'' sperm, the sex gene on its Y chromosome kicks to life, starting a chain reaction of hormones that eventually direct the fetus to become a boy. Among its jobs is shutting off the female sex gene on the X chromosome. But if there is no Y sex gene, then a few hours later, the X sex gene turns on, starting the process toward womanhood. This is mostly speculation, although <ORGANIZATION> Eicher </ORGANIZATION> said she has found a hint in some strains of mice that something like this could be going on. But at least by challenging people's assumptions, she hopes to eventually get closer to the biological truth. `` We think we know so much,'' she said. `` What I am continually amazed by is that we know almost nothing.''

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> gets frustrated about the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, he starts talking about Oreo cookies and milk. <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> says that if he believed Oreos could control insects and he wanted to dangle them in a field, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> would force him to do a battery of tests to learn if the cookies were an environmental threat. `` At this point, I do n't know if that's an exaggeration,'' says <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON>, who spent two years getting permits to test pheromones _ chemicals that insects produce to communicate _ as an alternative to pesticides. He and pheromone expert <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Roelofs </PERSON> have devised a compound simulating the mating scent of female Grape Berry Moths. <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> says it is as safe `` as spraying milk'' on crops, can replace up to 12 pounds of insecticides, and does n't even kill the bugs it is meant to control. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Touhey </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> adviser, acknowledges that regulations for toxic pesticides are unnecessarily stringent for such non-toxic alternatives, but is confident that ways can be found to simplify the process. `` Pheromones are in their infancy in terms of practical use,'' says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Insect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>, Md. About 250 pheromones have been identified since their discovery in 1959, and some are being used, <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> says, including one to control the cotton boll weevil and another on the Oriental fruit moth on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> peaches. However, they never lived up to their early promise. Companies ca n't make enough profit because they only work for one species, limiting the market. They are not successful on pests that gather in great numbers, masking the scent. And research and development has run into regulatory roadblocks and apathy. <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roelofs </PERSON> spent nearly two years getting a permit for a large-scale test. They had to learn legal jargon to explain what they wanted to do, track down the right forms and present pages of evidence and documentation required by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. `` Our problem is that we have a non-toxic chemical being watched over by regulations for toxic chemicals,'' said <PERSON> Roelofs </PERSON>, who works with <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Agricultural Experiment Station of <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Touhey </PERSON>, senior agricultural adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> office of pesticide programs, said, `` It seems the traditional mechanisms that were working in the past to regulate things does n't seem to be working now.'' In <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON>'s experiment, male moths attracted to clear plastic twist-ties laced with the pheromone have trouble finding fertile females, thus preventing explosive growth of the bugs in the vineyard. He had sought a permit letting him use pheromones _ which have a chemical makeup similar to olive oil _ and sell the grapes. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said OK, but only if he destroyed the grapes, costing him $ 10,000 he might have earned. Then it said he could sell them. <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> expects to have results from his tests in 100 acres of grapes across <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after the harvest. If they are favorable, the next step will be to get the pheromone on the market. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, who grows 275 acres of grapes in <ORGANIZATION> Westfield </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, said he would welcome a chance to stop using the pesticide Parathion. `` Any time we can eliminate using something that dangerous, I think it's a good thing.'' Under current rules, however, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> requires a study to determine environmental impact of the `` pesticide.'' That includes feeding it to ducks and shellfish, and could cost millions, <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> said. Both <PERSON> Touhey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> believe a compromise can be reached that will make it easier for pheromones to reach farmers and growers. In some cases, tests could be waived, <PERSON> Touhey </PERSON> said. In others, the number of tests could be cut. Meanwhile, he's trying to help pheromone researchers get certain permits and guide them through the regulatory maze. And while theoretically Oreo cookies and milk used to `` control or mitigate'' insects would be pesticides, realistically the morass of regulations includes a waiver of tests, he said. `` But I get the point.''

<HEAD>Bone Loss In Women Runners May Be Irreversible, Studies Suggest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Women who exercise enough to disrupt their menstrual periods may suffer an irreversible loss of strength in their bones that could lead to serious fractures or a kind of premature aging, new studies suggest. A 24-year-old woman whose periods are irregular can have the bones of a 50-year-old, said Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesnut </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>. `` Once that loss has occurred, it appears there's very little we can do about it.'' The bone loss can lead to potentially serious spinal fractures and to less serious stress fractures that will keep women from exercising. Women can regain regular periods by reducing their level of exercise, but the bones do n'the female gene Her theory says if an egg is fertilized by a `` male'' sperm, the sex gene on its Y chromosome kicks in, starting a chain reaction of hormones that direct the fetus to become a boy. Among its jobs is shutting off the female sex gene on the X chromosome. If there is no Y sex gene, then a few hours later, the X sex gene turns on, starting the process toward womanhood.

<HEAD>Much Ballyhooed Alternative to Pesticides Facing Uphill Struggle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> gets frustrated about the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, he starts talking about Oreo cookies and milk. He says if he believed Oreos could control insects, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> would force him to prove they were n't a threat. `` At this point, I do n't know if that's an exaggeration,'' says <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON>, who spent two years getting permits to test pheromones _ non-toxic chemicals that insects produce to communicate _ as an alternative to pesticides. He and pheromone expert <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Roelofs </PERSON> have devised a compound simulating the mating scent of female Grape Berry Moths. Male moths attracted to plastic laced with the pheromone have trouble finding fertile females, preventing explosive growth of the bugs in a vineyard. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Touhey </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> adviser, acknowledges that regulations for toxic pesticides are unnecessarily stringent for such non-toxic alternatives, but is confident that ways can be found to simplify the process. He says cookies and milk used as pesticides could get a waiver from tests, `` but I get the point.'' About 250 pheromones have been identified since their discovery in 1959, and some are in use, says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Insect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>, Md. One controls boll weevils and another on the Oriental fruit moth on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> peaches. However, they never lived up to their early promise. Companies ca n't make enough profit because they only work for one species, limiting the market. They are not successful on pests that gather in great numbers, masking the scent. And research and development has run into regulatory roadblocks and apathy. <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roelofs </PERSON> spent nearly two years getting a permit for a large-scale test. They had to learn legal jargon to explain what they wanted to do, track down the right forms and present pages of evidence and documentation required by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. `` Our problem is that we have a non-toxic chemical being watched over by regulations for toxic chemicals,'' said <PERSON> Roelofs </PERSON>, who works with <PERSON> Dennehy </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Agricultural Experiment Station of <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Heartworm Drug Can Prevent African Parasite Infection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A drug long used to free dogs of heartworms also apparently prevents a serious parasitic disease among visitors to some parts of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. An estimated 13 million people in western and central <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are infected with loa loa, the African eyeworm, but loiasis, the disease it causes, is usually most severe among outsiders who visit <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The worm is spread by biting flies that feed on human blood, and is parasitic in or just under the skin, often migrating to around the eyes. The heartworm drug, diethylcarbamazine, kills the worm before the body mounts a strong immune response to it. The major consequences of the disease, including possible heart and kidney damage, result from the body's immune reaction to the worm. Doctors from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases tested diethylcarbamazine on <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> volunteers in <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Forty-one took weekly doses of the medicine for two years, while 60 others took placebo pills. Six in the placebo group got loiasis, but none of the diethylcarbamazine users got sick. While the drug is considered safe, the doctors said it is not necessary for people who make brief visits to major cities in the region. The research team, headed by Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nutman </PERSON>, reported their findings recently in the New England Journal of Medicine.

<HEAD>Archaeologist Seeks To Market Obsidian, Glass Surgical Blades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An archaeologist who cut himself 20 years ago on a 3,500-year-old obsidian blade thinks the Mayans had the right idea. Payson Sheets says obsidian blades can be 500 times sharper than steel, resulting in more exact cuts that heal quicker and with less scarring. He and ophthalmologist <PERSON> Firmon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardenbergh </PERSON> are seeking <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> permission to make and sell glass and obsidian surgical blades. Obsidian, formed when lava cools too quickly to crystallize, was traded throughout the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> by Indians as tool material. Unlike steel, Sheets says, the black, glassy material can be fractured to a few molecules thick. <PERSON> Hardenbergh </PERSON> uses the blades in cornea transplants and cataract surgery, and the partners have loaned obsidian and glass blades to other surgeons while they await <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval, Sheets says. That process could take more than a year. Sheets also is experimenting by mixing a hardening agent into molten glass so blades will hold a tougher and more consistent edge. He pours the molten glass into molds to make blades of different shapes and sizes.

<HEAD>Planned Building Will Display Effects of Wind, Quakes</HEAD>

 Anyone nervous about the effects of wind or earthquakes on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION>'s planned engineering building will have only to go down to the lobby and see what the building says. Instruments planted throughout the building when it is built beginning next summer will measure those forces and display them and the movements of machines and people on a computer-generated graphic display. `` We will put transducers in the beams and columns to measure varying loads and how the building responds to those loads,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, associate professor of civil engineering. `` Instruments that measure wind pressure will be installed so we can determine how the building is affected by wind, and how the real responses compare to the formulas we now use to design buildings. `` It will be a working laboratory. We will be able to make precise measurements of forces that before could only be estimated.'' The building can be used to `` demonstrate engineering mechanics principles, and as a research tool to learn more about design and construction and the long-term behavior of people,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Radiation Detector, Similar To Smoke Alarm, Gets Mixed Reviews</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> company selling a home radiation detector like a smoke detector acknowledges it wo n't go off until exposure levels reach five times the minimum standards set by the government, and safety officials question other company claims. `` Over a hundred nuclear power plants are a prime source of peril for some 30 million households situated nearby,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Unique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>. In an accident, he said, people should `` get out fast.'' `` We're not merchants of fear. On the contrary, we want people to understand that a nuclear mishap is not like exploding a nuclear bomb. People can protect themselves,'' <PERSON> Little </PERSON> said. The EarlyWarning Radiation Detector sounds an alarm at about five times the minimum government standard for exposure of nuclear plant workers. Little said such standards are a matter of scientific controversy. A six-page manual advises that when an alarm sounds, people should stay calm, gather essentials, lock their homes and head away from the radiation source without speeding. Every few miles, they should check the detector. `` When it no longer sounds, then you know you have reached safety.'' If the alarm sounds at a higher setting than the minimum, `` you need to change directions.'' Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasma </PERSON> said more than a sound-and-light alarm would be needed to decide how to handle a radiation emergency. `` Evacuation is not always the answer,'' <PERSON> Strasma </PERSON> said, because a building may provide protection. `` The answer to dealing with a nuclear accident is to follow the emergency plan and the advice of state and local officials.'' Little pointed out that the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> acknowledges `` nearly 3,000 accidents occur every year at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> power plants.'' <PERSON> Strasma </PERSON> said that number refers to situations that include minor procedural infractions and called Little's wording a `` vast overstatement.'' Nonetheless, <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Marabito </PERSON> said he could foresee no agency action to counteract any statements used in selling the device. `` If he feels it's correct, that's between him and the buyer,'' <PERSON> Marabito </PERSON> said. Little had no sales information on the device, which he said was test-marketed in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European distribution began after the National Hardware Show here in August.

<HEAD>New Long-Term Conditions Set For Argentinian Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>An AP News Analysis</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new, long-term way of dealing with the Third World's crippling $ 1.2 trillion debt may be foreshadowed by $ 700 million worth of new loans the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is offering to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. On the surface, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> seems a poor prospect for more loans. It already owes more than $ 49 billion, the biggest debt of any Third World country after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. It should be paying $ 4.5 billion this year in interest alone, and already is about $ 1 billion behind in its payments. With interest rates rising, the bill may be $ 1 billion higher next year. The financial world is so skeptical about the prospects for repayment that Argentine loans can be bought for less than 22 cents on the dollar. Finance Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sourrouille </PERSON> says he hopes to pay half the interest out of the country's own earnings. The rest he will have to borrow, presumably from many of the same banks that lent the original money. President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s government, the first one freely elected after years of military rule, faces an election in 1989. Many of his opponents, who are given an excellent chance to succeed him, are talking about suspending interest payments altogether. Yet the 151 governments in the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> probably will approve the new loans next month. The bank's sister organization, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, has been negotiating all summer with the Argentine government to make another $ 1.2 billion in loans. <PERSON> Sourrouille </PERSON> says negotiations should be completed in a couple of weeks, and he then will know how much to ask from the commercial banks _ probably more than $ 1 billion. Why all this new lending? It has a lot to do with an old banker's saying: `` Lend a man a thousand dollars and he's in your power; lend him a million and you're in his.'' The lenders keep on lending in the hope that <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and the other big debtors will use the money wisely, investing in new factories and farm equipment so they can earn more money from their exports and catch up with their bills. It's called `` growing out of financial difficulties.'' The lenders, all represented at the current fund and bank meetings in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, see no other choice. The fund says the strategy is working well, and that the debtors' exports are growing faster than their debts. New loans are given under conditions usually tied to economic policies. If the borrower fails to meet them, the disbursements are cut off. Traditionally, the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> has taken the lead in setting the conditions, providing a `` seal of approval'' for other creditors. But the fund was set up originally to deal with short-term currency problems. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is intended to aid long-term development of poor countries. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> is considered a `` middle-income'' country, with individual earnings averaging $ 2,370 a year _ compared with $ 120 in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and $ 21,250 in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has fallen on hard times and incomes have been declining through the 1980s. So the country is considered a candidate for basic improvements. Now, for the first time, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has taken the lead in setting conditions, and many of them are conditions on long-term policy of a kind that the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> would not require. Sourrouille not only has promised to cut government spending sharply, but also is undertaking other changes basic to his country's economy. He has promised the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> he will strengthen the tax administration, reducing tax evasion and improving collections. He is attempting to improve the bank system, making the major public banks self-sustaining rather than dependent on government subsidies, and has promised new policies on trade and industry. There has been some grumbling. <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, the British chancellor of the exchequer, has warned against easing the conditions for loans. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> accord with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> reportedly made some <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> people furious. But <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> managing director, welcomed the agreement publicly. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and the fund are expected to agree on further conditions. Commercial banks presumably will come in with their loans, including new money for investment in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. The hope is that the new policies will put the country back on the road to the kind of prosperity it enjoyed before World War II. If they do, the new leadership by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> may furnish a model for other countries in long-term trouble.

 Economists of major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies are predicting the economy will slow in 1989. A panel of 60 economists from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION> on Monday made a median forecast of 2.3 percent growth next year, substantially less than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's forecast of 3.1 percent. Nearly half of the economists _ 47 percent _ said in a survey in late August and early September that they expected the country to topple into a recession by the end of next year. Another 42 percent believe a recession will occur in 1990. Only 11 percent believe the 6-year-old economic expansion will continue into 1991 or later. Separately, a trade group reported that sales of existing single-family homes increased a modest 1.1 percent in August as buyers tried to close purchases before interest rates rose further. Also Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats gave up on trying to raise the minimum wage, and their staff issued a report charging the economy was producing mainly low-wage jobs. The home sales report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing homes rose after a sharp 5.0 percent decline in July. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Savacool </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, economic forecasting firm, said buyers completing sales in August probably began looking for homes in May and June. `` That was just after rates started rising,'' he said. The increase `` was a mild panic response to rising rates.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> said a five-day Republican filibuster effectively had killed chances of raising the $ 3.35-an-hour minimum wage this year. `` There is no point in our continuing to pound on their door,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` I'm now conceding that the Republican filibuster was successful The Democratic staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said in its wage report that the proportions of both high-paying and low-paying jobs have grown in the 1980s. The report added fuel to an election-year debate over the quality of the 16 million new jobs added since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981. The report said slightly more than 50 percent of the net increase in new jobs since 1979 paid a year-round, full-time equivalent less than $ 11,611, while 12 percent of them paid more than $ 46,444. Many of the low-wage jobs were held by people who were not the primary wage earners in their families. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the committee's ranking Republican and former chairman, called the report `` opportunistic and political.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> hopes its post-crash reform package announced earlier this year will receive government approval by the anniversary of the Oct. 19 market rout, but federal regulators are n't making promises. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solodar </PERSON>, senior vice president of the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stock market, said Monday the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> actively was reviewing the reform proposals, devised jointly with the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The reforms would supercede the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s temporary `` collar'' restraint on computerized program trading, a six-month experiment approved by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> last April 20 that was aimed at calming wild price swings. The collar expires Oct. 19, the anniversary of the crash. Speaking to reporters at an <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> briefing about steps taken to improve the climate for stock trading since the crash, <PERSON> Solodar </PERSON> said it was possible the new reforms would not be in place by the anniversary, but `` we believe the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> will approve them.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to specify when the reforms would be approved. They were announced in July, but not filed with the regulatory agency until late August. `` The staff is actively reviewing these matters and is trying to expedite its review consistent with the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> request,'' said <PERSON> Brendon </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> associate director of market regulation. Market regulatory officials have said privately that potential complications have arisen because other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities markets dislike the proposed reforms. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>, which supervises over-the-counter trading, has expressed opposition to them. Under the reforms, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> markets agreed on a one-year pilot program for what they called coordinated `` circuit breakers'' that would halt trading temporarily if price moves exceeded preset limits. The halts would be triggered in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by a 250-point move in the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks and in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> by a 12-point move in the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock-index futures contract. The reforms also call for tighter communication between the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> exchanges and a common policy on `` intermarket front-running,'' an abuse in which traders are able to take a profitable position in one market based on what they know will happen in another market. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> also has prepared what it calls an `` <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delivery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>,'' which will provide transmission priority to individual investor orders when the Dow average moves 25 points from its previous close. This reform was designed to reassure investors that their orders will receive equal treatment with those from large institutional investors. On Black Monday, many individuals complained they could not sell their stock because larger investors were served first. <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> officials conceded at the Monday briefing that individual investors remain unwilling to re-enter the stock market, which has failed to recoup much of the loss from the crash and has been plagued by low trading volume. Asked to speculate when individuals would regain the confidence to invest in stocks, <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Grasso </PERSON> said: `` That is beyond my crystal ball at the moment.'' A bleak assessment of when individual investor confidence also was offered Monday in a post-crash review by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assocation </ORGANIZATION>, a leading Wall Street trade group. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said in a statement that although the worst fears about the economy never materialized after the collapse and market conditions have improved in some areas, `` the overall current environment is at best gray.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION> `` believes the near-term outlook is n't likely to improve substantially until full investor confidence is restored in both the integrity of the marketplace and the strength of the economy.'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> also said there have been a few steps to correct problems exposed as a result of the crash, `` but major regulatory reform has n't taken place.''

<HEAD>OPEC Chairman Says Oil Cartel On Cusp Of Starting Over</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto is cq as one name.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s president says the cartel's attempts to restore production discipline among its members are unlikely to produce any startling breakthroughs, but could mark the start of the group's climb back to its former authority in the world oil market. In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> also said the cartel's decision to review crude oil price and production objectives was part of a methodical process aimed at achieving unity among its members and shoring up prices. `` Now the time has come to sit down and say, okay, this is what we want; this is how we're going to do it _ let's go ahead an do it,'' <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> said in an interview at the end of a two-day extraordinary meeting here of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s five-member Price Monitoring Committee. The pricing committee announced Monday it had called for a joint meeting with the five-member Long Term Strategy Committee. <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> said the move would bring together key members of <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> to `` see if we can come up with something we can sell to the organization as a whole.'' The pricing committee issued a communique that said: `` it is essential that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> review its objectives and strategies in the context of current circumstances for the short, medium and the long terms especially concerning the price of oil and the production mechanism to support it in the light of the expressed positions of member countries.'' <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has attempted to maintain a world crude oil price of $ 18 a barrel by restricting the output of its members. But internal dissension that worsened during the eight-year war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> _ two founding members of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> _ has led to overproduction and a world oil glut that has depressed crude prices to their lowest levels in two years. The Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production at 19 million barrels a day in August and <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> has put <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production at closer to 20 million barrels per day. Last June, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> set a 15.06 million barrel a day ceiling to apply to all <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations except <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which contended it needed the to produce more oil to help rebuild its war-torn economy. On Monday, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brent </LOCATION> crude for delivery in October was quoted at $ 13.25, up slightly from Friday. The signing of an Iran-Iraq ceasefire in August apparently opened a door of opportunity for the start of a slow, but deep review of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s strategies and targets regarding pricing and production policies. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Term </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Others include <LOCATION> Saudia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The pricing committee comprises the oil ministers of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. Referring to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> at a press conference Monday in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> said both countries indicated they would participate in the joint committee meeting set for next month at an undisclosed location. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said it would be the first time in years that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> engaged in direct talks within <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> officials said the decision to call a joint meeting of the pricing and long term strategy committees before any extraordinary session of all <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers was part of a negotiating process that was arranged at the previous price monitoring committee meeting Aug. 3 in <LOCATION> Lausanne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. After that meeting, <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> was asked to visit various <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries to discuss possibilities and ideas that could smooth over differences within the cartel, the officials said. `` All these meetings are part of a decision-making process,'' <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> said. But he emphasized the slow, steady pace toward more unity could not be expected to bring about startling breakthroughs. <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> said no <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> officials believe the first joint committee meeting will produce a new benchmark price or quotas. `` I'm not trying to belittle the importance of the -LRB- joint -RRB- meeting. We could come up with something which is big,'' <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> said. `` All the major actors will be there,'' he said. `` At the end of the day we'll get something.'' Speaking of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> said `` Nobody should be allowed to act unilaterally anymore _ whether we have a quota or we do n't have a quota. We must sit down and agree on what to do.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> expects to raise $ 333 million after taxes from the sale of stores and food processing plants under a massive restructuring aimed at thwarting two takeover bids. The $ 4.6 billion restructuring will leave <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> shareholders with continuing interest in the company and will be more lucrative than the unsolicited purchase offers by <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday in outlining the plan. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Everingham </PERSON> and president <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pichler </PERSON> said the restructuring also would turn <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest supermarket operator, into a smaller, albeit highly leveraged company. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors rejected as inadequate both the $ 4.6 billion cash and securities offer by New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> and the rival $ 4.32 billion bid by <PERSON> Dart </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>, Md. The board also was advised there could be antitrust problems with the offer from <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>, which recently outbid <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Shop grocery chains. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 62 -LCB- cents to close at $ 56.37 -LCB- a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Monday. The restructuring, which will be <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s second since 1986, is worth $ 57 to $ 61 per share, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s plan, which was publicly proposed Sept. 13, would pay company shareholders $ 40 a share in cash, plus securities valued at $ 8 and publicly traded stock worth between $ 5 and $ 10. The company will net about $ 333 million from the sale of assets, and will lay off workers at its <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> headquarters. <PERSON> Everingham </PERSON> declined to tell reporters which food processing plants will be sold or how many headquarters employees would be laid off. Those layoffs will be in addition to a cost-cutting program already under way to reduce headquarters employment through attrition, <PERSON> Everingham </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> said it had commitments for $ 3.6 billion in bank financing for the restructuring, from a group led by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> Spokesmen for <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> declined comment Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> said it would sell some of its food processing facilities nationwide; its 27-supermarket Fry's of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> division in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; its six-unit <ORGANIZATION> Welcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> superwarehouse venture in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; and its 29 supermarkets in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> also said it would sell its 16-unit <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to a management-led investment group, would continue the sale of its <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choice </ORGANIZATION> division, and would and then lease back Kroger-owned stores and real estate in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. It will continue its <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> retail operations in that state and will sell its general merchandise distribution center in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The 105-year-old company announced Friday that it intended to go ahead with the restructuring despite competing offers by <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family, which controls <PERSON> Dart </PERSON>, triggered the competition when federal regulators announced this month that they had given the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> clearance to buy at least $ 15 million worth of <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> stock. <PERSON> Dart </PERSON>, a retailing company which has been involved in a number of unsuccessful but profitable takeover bids in recent years, offered a week ago to buy <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> for $ 55 a share in cash and securities for each of <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s 78.6 million outstanding shares. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> entered the bidding Tuesday with an offer to buy <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> for $ 58.50 in cash and securities in a leveraged buyout. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> operates more than 1,300 supermarkets, 935 convenience stores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states. The company also processes food products for sale in its stores and to outside customers. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> won a hostile takeover battle for <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> in which the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family was a bidder in 1985, and outbid the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Shop earlier this year. <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> owns the Crown Books and <ORGANIZATION> Trak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> chains.

<HEAD>Industry Survey Finds 40 Percent Pay Bank Credit Cards In Full
Each Month</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says changing tax laws are prompting more consumers to pay their credit card balances in full each month. A new survey by the industry trade group indicates 40 percent of consumers pay their monthly card bills in full, up from about 33 percent last year. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Retail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Card </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, said the increase stemmed from the federal tax law, which is phasing out credit card interest deductions over a four-year period ending in 1991. The study, released Monday, also found that overall growth in the bank credit card business had slowed because of stiff competition from other issuers, such as <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. `` The survey results reflect the fierce competition among bank card issuers,'' said <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>. `` The range of prices and card features gives consumers a virtually unlimited number of options.'' The number of Visa and <ORGANIZATION> MasterCard </ORGANIZATION> cardholders grew by about 9 percent last year, a slowdown in the rate of previous years, according to <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>. Visa and <ORGANIZATION> MasterCard </ORGANIZATION>, both bank-owned credit card associations, represent 60 percent of the bank credit card market. `` We've seen the entrance of significant new competition over the last couple of years,'' said <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, who also is executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Signet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The report found consumers charged more than $ 165 billion on their bank cards last year, an increase of 18.8 percent for <ORGANIZATION> Mastercard </ORGANIZATION> and 12.3 percent for Visa. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> report was based on a survey of 1,444 card-issuing banks selected from a national sample based on asset size and includes 1987 and first quarter 1988 data on bank card interest rates, fees, marketing and operations. The number of banks charging the maximum interest rate allowed in their states declined to less than one-fourth, according to <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, who attributed the drop to increased market competition. Banks that charged the maximum rate included 18 percent of banks with assets under $ 300 million and 27 percent of large banks with assets above $ 1 billion, the report said. In comparison, last year's report found that 35 percent of the large banks, with assets above $ 1 billion, charged the maximum rate. That report also showed that about 26 percent of banks with assets below $ 500 million charged the highest rate allowed in their states. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> is the national trade and professional association for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> full service banks of all sizes. The bank card conference runs through Wednesday.

<HEAD>Big Three Competitors Say GMAC Leasing Incentives No Big Deal</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acceptance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is planning waves of publicity for its new car and truck leasing incentives but its Big Three competitors say the offerings are nothing new. <ORGANIZATION> GMAC </ORGANIZATION>, the finance arm of the world's largest manufacturer, said Monday its `` SmartLease'' program can save customers money on monthly payments and tell them in advance how much it will cost to buy the car at the end of the lease. The most popular cars <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> makes are included in the program, but <ORGANIZATION> GMAC </ORGANIZATION> offered neither a range of savings nor specific examples of savings on any models. The finance divisions of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said they have offered similar deals for most of the decade. `` We have had a consumer leasing program that has been promoted extensively,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. `` We feel that we have been a leader in consumer leasing.'' <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Damaska </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> retail lease manager, said the company has offered a variety of incentives over the last 18 months while competing with the special interest rates and cash rebates offered to retail buyers. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> said the No. 3 carmaker's Gold Key Lease Finance Plan offers the same features as <ORGANIZATION> GMAC </ORGANIZATION>'s. <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> dealers work out the final post-lease purchase price with the customer. Included in the <ORGANIZATION> GMAC </ORGANIZATION> promotion, which runs through Dec. 31, are the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corsica </ORGANIZATION> and Beretta, the Pontiac Grand Am, three Cutlass models and two GMC truck lines, company spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. `` What we've done is a corporate-wide program,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. `` Leasing programs have been done by each of the divisions. Under our old programs, the purchase price was determined at the end of lease and was the fair market value of the car.'' Knowing the post-lease or residual value of the car up front is an advantage to the buyer in considering whether to buy out the lease at its end, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. The end of auto interest deductions on federal tax returns has made leasing a more attractive option, especially for young families trying to meet mortgage payments, which still are partly tax deductible, he said. `` It's also a lifestyle thing,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. `` It is n't important for people to own things like it used to be. National promotion of the SmartLease program began during Sunday night's telecast of the Summer Olympics. Extensive electronic and print ads are planned.

 High technology and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's defense buildup are responsible for the economic vitality of states that top a new survey of job and business creation, economists say <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> magazine's annual report on the states gave <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> the best track record for creating new jobs and businesses and stimulating growth of young companies in the last four years. `` A lot of these states are where they are because of what has happened in the last four to six years in the federal defense buildup,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Duobinis </PERSON>, director of regional economic forecasting for the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Many new electronics firms concentrated in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> have defense contracts. No. 5 <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> boasts the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and naval shipyards in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> News </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> once was the largest employer, now hosts companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bendix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>. `` You'll find a lot of those electronics firms are indeed in that <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> out to <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> area,'' <PERSON> Duobinis </PERSON> said. `` A lot of that has been defense stimulated.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> survey concludes the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> are thriving, but notes that some industrial states are making a comeback partly due to programs that use small amounts of tax dollars to foster private growth. Independent business analysts said the desert belt of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the rest of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> continue to benefit from lower wages, warm climate and defense growth. `` The states in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and some in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> have in fact lower wages and do attract business and continue to expand based on their lower cost of doing business,'' said <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, regional group associate director for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, the Lexington-based economic forecasting firm. The <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> survey measures how a state has done in stimulating entrepreneurial activity and economic expansion. It reflects the state economies' successes over a four-year period in job generation, new-business creation and young-company growth. For example, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> earned its third consecutive top ranking with 23.1 percent job growth since 1984 and 1,769 new companies with at least 10 employees for a 2.87 percent business birthrate, while 4 percent of companies founded since 1980 were rated fast-growing. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, last for the second straight year, lost 10.9 percent of its jobs, had a 0.8 percent business birthrate and a 0.97 percent rate of growing businesses. Some notable changes include <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which slipped from 12th to 20th with a job growth of just 2.9 percent due to the slumping oil industry. Economists said the decline in the value of the dollar and improving foreign trade figures have been major reasons for economic optimism in the slumping industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> survey, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> _ Nos. 23, 24, 25 _ each showed job growth of over 10.7 percent since 1984, and economists said most of it has come in the last two years. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> rose to 28th from 32nd with a strong 3.2 percent small company growth rate. `` They've been down so long that there's only one way to really to go and that's up,'' <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> was cited for using small amounts of public money to create incentives for larger private investment. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> now offers matching grants to promising new companies, while <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> offers tax credits to citizens who invest in a venture capital fund to support businesses. High-tech industry spinoffs from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> contributed to high rankings for <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and even <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, which jumped to 15th from 26th. Analysts said paper mills there have shifted production to computer paper from plain, old yellow pads. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, used data from the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cognetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Cambridge-based researcher, for the survey, which appears in the magazine's October issue.

 A dissident shareholder group trying to sell <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it was pleased the board of directors will allow a vote on the plan but that it still lacks important company data. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors amended the company's bylaws Monday so that New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Brookhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' plan to sell the company would require approval by a simple majority of shareholders. Before the action, company bylaws would have required unanimous consent from shareholders, a provision contested in court by <PERSON> Brookhurst </PERSON>. Brookhurst spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> said the revison was a positive step but his group needed to see <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s financial records and a list of company stockholders. `` It's hard for us to make any qualitative statement on the action by the board of directors today,'' <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Monday. `` We look forward to bringing our case to the shareowners, but we are still waiting for the owners' list.'' <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> stock fell 25 cents a share to $ 19.75 Monday in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> said in a statement that his company revised the bylaw `` so shareholders will not be distracted from the key issue of who is best qualified to direct the future of this company _ <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s present board or <ORGANIZATION> Brookhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> refused to elaborate on <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON>'s statement, citing <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regulations, or to say whether <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> had made any recommendation to shareholders on the Brookhurst offer <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, the last remaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television manufacturer, has lost millions in recent years struggling to compete with low-cost imported electronic goods. Last year, the company posted a loss of $ 19.1 million on sales of $ 2.36 billion. Brookhurst, which owns 6.1 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding common shares, bought into the company in June with the intention of selling the television and computer maker, <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> said his group, formed by <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abelow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ihasz </PERSON>, would be open to a `` realistic management plan to achieve profitability.''

<HEAD>Britian's Trade Gap Fells In August</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit totaled 1.813 billion pounds, or $ 3.06 billion, in August _ the second-worst monthly shortfall _ but it narrowed sharply from the previous month's record gap, the government reported Tuesday. The deficit report was below market forecasts of up to 1.9 billion pounds, or $ 3.17 billion, and the British pound firmed on the news. Stock prices also got a slight boost. Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said in a statement that the Conservative government had tightened monetary conditions to curb sharp rises in imports and `` the effects of this will inevitably take some time to come through.'' British commercial banks have pushed up their base interest rates by 4.5 percent to 12 percent since early June. The seasonally adjusted merchandise trade deficit had spurted 72 percent to a record 2.65 billion pounds, or $ 4.5 billion, in July, prompting a full percentage point increase in interest rates. Exports in August totaled 6.75 billion pounds, or $ 11.4 billion, down from 6.775 billion pounds, or $ 11.45 billion, in July and up from 6.6 billion pounds, or $ 11.1 billion, in August 1987. Imports totalled 8.561 billion pounds, or $ 14.5 billion, down 9 percent from 9.427 billion pounds, or $ 15.9 billion, in July and up from 8 billion pounds, or $ 13.5 billion, in August 1987. For the first eight months of the year, the merchandise trade balance has been in deficit by 12.85 billion pounds, or $ 21.7 billion, more than double the 6.160 billion pound, or $ 10.4 billion, gap a year ago.

<HEAD>Taiwan To Reimpose Capital Gains Tax On Stock Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Finance Minister <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo </PERSON> said Tuesday the reimposition of a capital-gains tax on stock profits next year is meant to maintain a fair taxation system despite investors' worries the levy would trigger a market slump `` It is not government intervention. We merely want to make it fair to all taxpayers,'' <PERSON> Kuo </PERSON> told a news conference. On Saturday, <PERSON> Kuo </PERSON> announced the government would reimpose the tax on stock profits next year after a 12-year freeze. Individual investors who sell stocks worth more than 3 million <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollars, or $ 103,448, should include the stock income when filing their annual income tax, she said. Observers said the surprise move, timed before the four-day, Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, was designed to cool down the stock market. `` There will surely be heavy selling pressure when it re-opens Thursday,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>New Pact For Innovative Margin Rules Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the nation's largest options clearing house have reached an agreement on new rules to ease the strain on the system caused by heavy trading, officials said The agreement between the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, announced Monday calls for cross-margining on certain stock index futures and options accounts. Margins are deposits paid by traders to cover the risk of daily losses. Cross margining allows traders to have credit for trading positions that reduce their risk of loss. Under the plan, traders who have protected their positions by hedging in both markets would have to put up less money for their margins. The practice was recommended by a presidential commission that investigated last October's stock market crash and must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and Options Clearing, the nation's largest options clearing house, have been working on the cross-margining program for about a year. Had cross-margining been permitted during the huge decline in the stock market on Oct. 19, it would have reduced the strain on the nation's financial system and eased demands for cash on several major banks that ran into billions of dollars a day.

<HEAD>Democrats Push Job-Protected Leaves For Workers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fresh from losing a bruising fight to raise the minimum wage, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats marched back onto the battlefield with an equally controversial proposal requiring job-protected medical and parental leaves for workers. `` What a profound and strong signal it would be'' to approve such a requirement, Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., said Monday in opening debate on the measure `` It would be catching up with the needs of people in this country.'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s bill would guarantee at least 13 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to seriously ill workers and at least 10 weeks to those with newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill children. Businesses of under 20 employees would be exempt. Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, D-Ark., planned to offer a substitute reducing the medical leave length to 10 weeks but it was unclear whether such a change would attract the 60 votes necessary to cut off debate Conservatives and many in the business community contend the government should not mandate benefits. `` I am concerned that this legislation may impede the trend ... now developing in the workplace where employees are able to choose from a variety of benefits,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, R-S. He and others also say any leave requirement would be an economic hardship on small businesses. But Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' watchdog agency, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, has estimated the bill would cost employers $ 3.50 per worker per year `` A penny a day so that working parents wo n't lose their jobs when they care for a newborn ... when they must care for a seriously ill child,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` I put the choice to the opponents of this bill _ can you spare a penny a day for these children? Or is this economic expansion so fragile that a penny a day will do us in?'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said he had received three veto letters from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on the family leave bill. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> appealed Monday for bipartisan support from his colleagues and from Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican presidential nominee. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, already has endorsed the Dodd approach. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said women should n't have to worry about getting their jobs back after a maternity leave but has not issued a detailed proposal. He is said to favor a voluntary approach involving tax breaks for businesses that offer job-protected leaves. Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, opposed the Dodd bill in committee <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> work on the parental leave bill came as the chamber's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders on Monday gave up all hope of passing legislation to increase the minimum wage this year, conceding defeat to a Republican filibuster

 Oil futures prices plunged to near two-year lows for the second time this month as fears of a worsening oil glut spread through the market. Analysts said rumors that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s largest producer, was continuing its discount strategy to boost market share in the wake of the cartel's price meeting sent the market into a tailspin. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, was trading as much as 35 cents lower, between $ 13.85 and $ 14.02 a barrel, compared with Monday's closing price of $ 14.20. Today's rumors were that the Saudis were offering discounts to the Japanese, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also are reported to be producing far in excess of their assigned quotas. `` It seems as if there's been a complete breakdown, with the Arabs leading the charge toward market share,'' <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> said. The fall in crude prices pulled down oil product prices. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery was trading between 44.50 and 44.90 cents a gallon, down from its close of 45.25 cents a gallon on Monday. And October wholesale heating oil had lost 1.13 cents before midday, to 39.10 cents a gallon from Monday's settlement price of 40.23 a gallon. The long-anticipated meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>' price committee adjourned Monday after two days of talks with no concrete steps announced for dealing with the world oversupply of oil or weakening oil prices. On Monday, confusion and uncertainty over <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s intentions caused wild gyrations in prices and trading activity, analysts said. `` Rumors went both ways but there were points where buying completely dried up, then came back,'' <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> said. Energy futures prices opened higher, then tumbled after statements by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> that the pricing committee had adjourned without calling for a full meeting of the cartel to deal with the problems of excess oil production and sagging prices. Instead, <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said the pricing committee and <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s long-term strategy committee would meet jointly next month to review supply and demand problems. Analysts said the marketplace interpreted the statements as an indication the cartel was unwilling to cut production. `` The marketplace was disappointed in the committee's failure to come up with a concrete direction,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Azarow </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened mostly lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, then turned mixed as follow-through selling from Monday abated. `` Everyone's just kind of feeling their way a little bit here this morning after yesterday's bang,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with the G.H. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> division of the British-owned trading company <ORGANIZATION> LIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Soybean futures registered their lowest daily settlement price in nearly four months Monday, $ 8.06 \ a bushel for November delivery Buying prompted by technical market factors provided some support for corn and soybean futures this morning, but wheat remained weak due to slack export demand, <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON> said. Analysts blamed Monday's slide on the advancing harvest, which is increasing the amount of available corn and soybeans. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that corn harvesting was 20 percent complete and soybean harvesting was 14 percent finished as of Sunday. In early trading, wheat was unchanged to -RCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.21 -RCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 1 \ cents higher with December at $ 2.82 a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.46 a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents lower to 3 cents higher with November at $ 8.07 a bushel Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .30 cent higher with October at 71.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .43 cent higher with September at 80.15 cents a pound; hogs were .22 cent lower to .10 cent higher with October at 40.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .60 cent lower to .25 cent higher with February at 51.65 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Mixed In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices were mixed in subdued trading early today with little new economic data to move the market. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year issue was up 3-32 point, or about 90 cents for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest rate trends, slipped to 9.07 percent from 9.08 percent late Monday. Analysts said the market had not responded to an early drop in oil prices, which usually is favorable to bonds because it signals an easing of inflationary pressures. The dollar also appeared stable after waffling on Monday and closing higher against most major currencies. `` It seems the -LRB- bond -RRB- market does n't want to do anything until we get more information,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiners </PERSON>, vice president of money-market research for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said bond investors are already looking to next week's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment report for a clearer indication of the economy Unemployment rose slightly last month, which many interpreted as a sign the economy is slowing. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term government issues were down 1-32 point, intermediate maturities were 1-32 point higher to 1-32 point lower, and 20-year issues were 1-16 point lower, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, was down 0.16 at 1,140.47. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, advanced 0.18 to 289.96. Three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills were up 6 basis points to a discount rate of 7.28 percent and a yield of 7.51. Six-month bills advanced 4 basis points to 7.90 percent and a yield of 7.51 percent, while one-year bills were unchanged at a discount rate of 7.61 and a yield of 8.18 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 8 \ percent, down from 8 5-16 percent late Monday

<HEAD>Company Alleges Japan Trying To Evade Duties</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Hyster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> contends that its Japanese competitors now are `` dumping'' forklift parts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in an effort to evade new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customs duties imposed on them for selling complete forklifts below cost. After a yearlong battle by <PERSON> Hyster </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government decided last spring to impose customs duties ranging as high as 50 percent on the imports. The company now alleges that the Japanese are trying to circumvent those duties by importing the vehicles in pieces and assembling them in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Hyster officials say they have collected data that show imports of forklift parts have nearly doubled this year compared to last year. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> administrators, Hyster notes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statistics list truck part imports at $ 16.7 million in the first six months of 1987. This year those imports jumped to $ 34.9 million. The company asks the government to determine whether trucks assembled in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also should be subject to the duties. Hyster notes in its letter that the new trade law allows federal officials to assess duties against companies that simply switch from dumping finished products to dumping parts, which then are assembled in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or in a third country. In a similar case involving dumping televisions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>, the government decided imported parts that were assembled in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also were subject to dumping duties.

<TEXT>
 One of the most thankless and unrewarding positions to be in today is that of the financial adviser waiting for the recession. It's been a very long wait for some of them, and a very costly experience for their customers. One of the breed, for example, advised his clients to get out of the stock market back in 1982, just before the bull charged. While his clients thus lost out on some fantastic gains, the investment adviser celebrated on Oct. 19, 1987, the day of the big stock market crash, believing his views were vindicated and his long wait made worthwhile. Re-invigorated, his company then made the scenario even more bleak and black, warning that interest rates would soar, major banks would collapse, production would cease, and a pall would descend over economic <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But it did n't happen. Instead of falling into line with his dictates and the pronouncements of his brethren, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy has grown sturdier since last year, and even dedicated doomsayers now are losing their patience. What had sustained many of them through their long, barren wait was the near certainty that economic expansions have limited lives _ that the very existence of an expansion was reason enough to forecast a recession. Each month, therefore, their conviction grew stronger but, unfortunately, so did the stability of the economy. And now, in spite of it nearing age 71 months, the economy is producing great doubts about the recession scenario. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagakama </PERSON>, a widely followed business economist, is among those who have recently expressed the notion that perhaps the country already has worked its way through a problem period and may be ready for renewed expansion. Broadly speaking, this is a thesis put forward by economists such as <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sindlinger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, among others, but <PERSON> Nakagama </PERSON> gives it his own particular touch. As he views events, the oil price decline and the dollar's depreciation helped the economy avoid recession in mid-1986 while at the same time setting in motion a new cyclical expansion He states that `` the oil price decline helped support consumer demand, while dollar depreciation fueled an export-cum-capital spending boom.'' Thus, he suggests, no early recession is likely even if the cycle is nearly 71 months old. <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON> went on record back in late 1986 with an argument that at least 31 states were in recession, no matter what the national statistics showed. From that point on, he states, the economy has become much stronger. <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, who has challenged the conventional thinking at every opportunity in the past year, provides an insight into how the economy can continue to grow while, in the view of many, it is at the limit of its capacity. First, he describes two scenarios that are held dear by the `` end of cycle crowd.'' 1. If the economy continues to grow, odds are that unemployment will fall below 5 percent. Labor shortages will boost wage inflation. Higher inflation will push interest rates to levels that ultimately trigger recession. 2. If the economy continues to grow, capacity utilization rates will rise and so will prices. Again, higher inflation will push interest rates to levels that ultimately trigger recession. But, he asks, what if business responds to the labor shortage and capacity restraints by increasing labor-saving, productivity-enhancing capital outlays? `` Then, capacity will expand and output can grow faster than employment. Wages will rise in this growth-is-good, extended-cycle scenario,'' he explains. However, he continues, `` the wage increases will be in line with productivity gains. So, unit labor costs wo n't put upward pressure on prices or downward pressure on profits.'' Can it happen? <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> says he believes it can and that it may already be happening in nondurable goods manufacturing.

 Federal investigators said today the pilot of the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet that crashed last November in a snowstorm in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> had a history of training problems and little experience flying jet aircraft. The experience of the cockpit crew of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1713 was a key focus of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s nearly year-long investigation of the crash last Nov. 15 in which 28 of the 82 people aboard were killed As the safety board prepared its final report of the accident, its staff of investigators made clear at a hearing that pilot experience and questions about whether the aircraft took off with ice on the wings were central factors in the accident. Investigators said first officer <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON>, 26, the plane's second in command who was at the controls of the <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 as it took off, had numerous training problems dating back to 1983 He had failed initial tests for his multi-engine license and was fired by a small air taxi operator in 1985 because of `` handling problems'' in flight tests. After being hired by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> in the summer of 1987, <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON> went through a series of simulator training tests in which instructors found him to have problems controlling his flights. At one such test an instructor said <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON> `` completely lost control of -LRB- his -RRB- aircraft with engine out at 2,000 feet ...,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> documents reviewed by the safety board. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said the airline was not aware of <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON>'s previous training problems. He said when inquiries were made about his previous employment, `` everything we got was terrific.'' <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON> had problems in one of his training sessions in a simulator, but said he had performed well at other times. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> was expected to issue a final report, including the probable cause for the Nov. 15 crash, later in the day. The board also has been looking into a possible failure in procedures that may have allowed the aircraft to depart with snow or ice on its wings, thereby inhibiting its ability to gain lift. Investigators said in opening today's hearing that as long as 27 minutes was believed to have passed between when the DC-9 was de-iced and went it took off. They said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s operations manual requires a pilot to check for possible icing on the wings if there is a delay of 20 minutes, but that there was no evidence such precautions were taken by the pilots of Flight 1713. The jet crashed seconds after lifting off from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> The DC-9 is particularly susceptible to ice contamination because it has no slats on the leading edge of the wings. <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON> had been hired by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> only four months prior to the crash and was making his first takeoff in a DC-9 during snowy conditions. He had a total of 3,186 hours of flying, but most of that was in propeller aircraft while working for a commuter airline. He had only 36 hours on a DC-9 and some of that was in training, according to investigators. Capt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Zvonek </PERSON>, 43, had 12,135 total hours of flying time with 33 hours as a DC-9 captain. Both <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON> and Zvonek were killed in the crash. Since the accident, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has advised airlines to require that the captain of a jetliner handle a takeoff in poor weather. Continental has put into place such a requirement since the accident and also has begun to arrange work flight assignments so that two relatively inexperienced pilots are not likely to be assigned to the same cockpit, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON>, vice president for flight operations. But <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON> and other senior <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> officials maintained in interviews Monday that the two pilots on Flight 1713 were qualified and properly trained. They also said the aircraft had been properly de-iced. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> findings are expected to be vigorously challenged by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, which maintains that the plane crashed because it encountered an unusual draft of wind _ a phenomenon called wake turbulence _ from another jetliner landing at a parallel runway 1,600 feet away. The <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> officials argued that the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators have not given enough attention to the wake-turbulence possibility. `` Our position is that this investigation is not complete'' until the wake turbulence possibility is more closely examined, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>.

 Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> want the judge presiding over the company's securities-fraud case removed because of an alleged conflict of interest involving his wife's family business, according to a report published Tuesday The motion to have <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> disqualify himself was contained in sealed court documents and revealed by unidentified sources familiar with the case, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> made the request last week, but the grounds behind the motion were not made public. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, who has a reputation for being a tough judge, had said he would hear arguments on the motion at an Oct. 11 hearing. Neither <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> nor <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s chief attorneys from the law firm <ORGANIZATION> Cahill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gordon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Reindel were available for comment Tuesday, their secretaries said.

 Share prices rose strongly in active trading Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, bolstered by news that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s trade performance for August was better than expected. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 15.3 points, or 0.85 percent, higher at 1,808.0, below its best level for the day of 1,813.2 but well above the psychologically important 1,800 barrier. Volume was a solid 461.5 million shares, up sharply from the 299.6 million shares that changed hands Monday. The report on the August trade figures assumed major importance after the figures for July showed a deficit more than double what private economists had forecast. The August trade deficit was 1.813 billion pounds, or about $ 3.06 billion. Market expectations had been for a shortfall of around 1.9 billion pounds, or $ 3.2 billion.

 <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday that it will take a charge of about $ 45 million against operations in its fourth quarter and consolidate various functions to save the company $ 50 million annually and cut 800 jobs. The new job cuts bring to about 4,000 the number of jobs cut since 1985. `` The company is committed to being a highly efficient, low-cost producer and because of advances in technology and productivity, that means fewer people in manufacturing,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skates </PERSON>, executive vice-president and chief operating officer. `` We see ongoing and tough cost management as a way of life for Data General.'' The company said it has made arrangements for outplacement services and pay and benefits continuation based on years of service of affected employees. The company employs more than 15,000 people world-wide. The current fourth-quarter earnings report is not yet available, the company said. For the first nine months ending June 25, earnings were $ 31.5 million, or $ 1.06 per share, on revenues of $ 1.02 billion. For the comparable 1987 period, the company reported a loss of $ 104.4 million on revenues of $ 942.1 million.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Rally; Wheat Declines</HEAD>

 Most corn futures prices closed moderately to sharply higher in a late rally Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> after an expected increase in farmers' selling of newly harvested corn failed to emerge. Soybean futures advanced with the corn market, but wheat futures finished slightly lower amid slack export demand, analysts said. The discovery over the weekend of the naturally occurring poison aflatoxin in some corn in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> had prompted speculation that farmers would try to sell such corn immediately, since the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would refuse to accept it as loan collateral. The tainted corn is harmless when blended with enough good corn to render the total aflatoxin content no more than 20 parts per billion for human consumption or 100 parts per billion for animal consumption. But with no evidence of a surge in farmers' selling of corn since Monday, futures traders decided the aflatoxin scare had been exaggerated, analysts said. `` The talk was there but there was n't the physical evidence of the corn coming to market,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with the G.H. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> division of the British-owned trading company <ORGANIZATION> LIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>.

 The stock market drifted today toward the lower end of the trading range that has prevailed for two weeks. The stock market has been stuck in a narrow range in recent weeks, not closing below 2,080 or above 2,101 on the Dow Jones average since Sept. 12. Traders said the stock market is sluggish partly because of a soft bond market. Bond traders have remained fearful of inflation in spite of a big drop in prices of gold and oil. In addition, short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills have provided an attractive alternative to both stocks and bonds. Three-month bills are yielding a healthy 7.55 percent. A big drop in oil prices failed to impress the stock market. The near-month contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, briefly fell as low as $ 13.85 a barrel before rebounding to the $ 14.12 range.

 Stock prices remained stuck in a narrow trading range Tuesday in the lightest trading since the end of August. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 2.84 to 2,082.33. That marked the average's 11th straight finish inside the range of 2,080-2 ,101 points Trading volume on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> was 113.01 million shares, down from 116.42 million in the previous session and the lowest since Aug. 30, when 108.72 million shares changed hands. Analysts and traders said the market was concerned by sluggishness in the bond market, which has failed to respond favorably to falling oil and gold prices and other indications that inflation pressure is easing. Relatively high rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities are giving investors an attractive and secure alternative to stocks and longer term securities. The three-month T-bill yielded about 7 -LCB- percent Tuesday. `` There's a lot of excuses to sit on your hands here, and I think people are using them,'' said <PERSON> Rodd </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a vice president of equity trading at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. On Tuesday, inflation signals were mixed Oil prices dropped sharply before rebounding to finish the day only slightly lower, and gold prices rose. Takeovers, restructurings and a stock buyback provided much of the interest in the day's session. <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 -RRB- to 88 | The publishing company said it had agreed to an amended acquisition offer by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> of $ 90.05 a share. Later <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, which had offered a rival bid of $ 89 a share, said it was evaluating the situation. <PERSON> SmithKline </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON> fell 2 to 46 -LRB-. The company announced a pre-tax charge against earnings of $ 375 million to $ 400 million and cuts of 1,600 jobs as part of a major restructuring. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 to 113 \ The computer maker announced plans to buy back up to $ 2 billion worth of its shares, or roughly 3 percent at current prices. Among other widely held stocks, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T fell -LRB- to 26, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> rose -RRB- to 43 and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> fell | to 73 -LCB-. Exxon fell -LCB- to 44 -RRB-, weighed down by the weakness in oil prices. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4-to-3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 600 issues up, 779 down and 543 unchanged. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 137.36 million shares. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index fell 0.32 to 151.64. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index fell 0.95 to 307.45, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index fell 0.60 to 253.68.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls as Pound Dominates Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was mostly lower Tuesday as the British pound dominated foreign-exchange markets following the release of trade deficit figures in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Gold prices rose. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 397.25 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $ 2.25 from late Monday's $ 395. The pound surged after the British government announced that its merchandise trade deficit had shrunk 31 percent in August. British Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said the deficit stood at 1.813 billion pounds, or $ 3.06 billion, the country's second-worst monthly shortfall but down from July's record 2.651 billion pounds <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a senior currency trader at <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the British trade figure was better than expected. Traders who earlier had sold pounds _ expecting negative trade news to send the currency lower _ turned around and bought heavily Tuesday, he said. The pound rose to $ 1.6780 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from $ 1.6720 late Monday. In earlier <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading, the dollar lost more than 1 cent against the pound. It cost $ 1.6785 to buy one pound in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, up from $ 1.6668 late Monday. With September drawing to a close, many traders stayed out of the market. `` Most people are not willing to put their profits on the line,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON>, an assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The dollar was up against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency rose to 134.63 yen from 134.535 yen late Monday. In earlier <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading, the dollar was quoted at 134.65 yen, and in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 134.58 yen, down 0.15 yen. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.8780 West German marks, down from 1.8817; 1.5895 Swiss francs, down from 1.5910; 6.3915 French francs, down from 6.4030; 1,399.42 Italian lire, dwon from 1,401.37; and 1.2205 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2195 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.8790 West German marks, down from 1.8835; 1.5910 Swiss francs, down from 1.5935; 6.3945 French francs, down from 6.5000; 2.1185 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1230; 1,402.95 Italian lire, down from 1,403.50; and 1.2185 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2211 Gold prices rose, but dealers said low oil prices kept bullion well below the $ 400-an-ounce barrier it plunged through last week. Falling energy prices are considered a harbinger of lower inflation, and gold is often bought as a hedge against higher inflation. Gold rose to $ 397.30 a troy ounce on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from late Monday's $ 395.10.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Surge On Signs Of International Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Coffee futures prices surged Tuesday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on indications that a new coffee price-support agreement was near. On other markets, sugar futures soared; energy futures retreated; copper and precious metals advanced; frozen pork bellies plunged; livestock were mixed; grains and soybeans were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated. News arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at midday from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, respectively the world's No. 1 and No. 2 coffee producers, had proposed an initial global export quota of 54 million bags for the 1988-89 marketing year. The reports sparked high-volume buying of coffee futures by roasters and speculators on ideas that the proposal could become the cornerstone of a new ICO agreement for stabilizing coffee prices in the upcoming marketing year, which begins Oct. 1. `` This was significant not only in that these two countries have agreed on something but in that it sets the tone for the conference as a whole,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, coffee market analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It indicates the meeting is progressing harmoniously.'' Under the proposal, coffee producers would limit sales to <ORGANIZATION> ICO </ORGANIZATION> consumers to 54 million bags during the marketing year, compared with this year's initial quota of 58 million bags. The ICO can adjust the quota upward or downward during the year, depending on market conditions, to keep prices stable. Global coffee consumption is declining, but demand for higher-priced `` mild'' coffees _ as opposed to the more plentiful `` robusta'' coffees _ is on the rise. <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said consumer nations might agree to the lower quota, which would tend to support prices, if producers agree to increase the percentage of milds in the export mix. Coffee settled 2.15 to 2.83 cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 1.2924 a pound. Sugar futures recovered nearly all of Monday's sharp losses on buying inspired by technical factors and rumors of physical sugar purchases by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said. Sugar settled .37 cent to .69 cent higher with October at 9.86 cents a pound. Crude oil futures dipped to 2-year lows below $ 14 a barrel early in the session on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> but recovered to finish only slightly lower than Monday's final prices. Analysts linked the early weakness to reports of continued discount sales of crude by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and pessimism about <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s search for a solution to the overproduction that has been blamed for the persistent weakness of crude oil prices West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 15 cents lower with November at $ 14.14 a barrel; heating oil was .55 cent to .72 cent lower with October at 39.51 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .45 cent lower to .34 cent higher with October at 45.59 cents a gallon. Copper futures posted new contract highs in most delivery months for the fourth straight day on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on continuing concern about tight supplies and rising demand. Copper settled 1.20 cents to 1.80 cents higher with September at $ 1.214 a pound. Precious metals futures also advanced on the Comex, buoyed by the stability in the oil market, analysts said. Gold settled $ 2.10 to $ 3 higher with October at $ 397.90 a troy ounce; silver was 5.5 cents to 6 cents higher with September at $ 6.166 a troy ounce. Frozen pork bellies for February and May delivery settled down the allowable daily limit of 2 cents a pound on a technically-inspired selloff on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said. Hog futures retreated on position-evening ahead of Friday's quarterly hogs-and-pigs report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, while cattle finishednarrowly mixed Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .38 cent higher with October at 70.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .37 cent lower to .15 cent higher with September at 79.80 cents a pound; hogs were .38 cent to .63 cent lower with October at 39.92 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.10 cents to 2 cents lower with February at 50.10 cents a pound. Most corn futures finished moderately to sharply higher in a late rally on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> after an expected increase in farmer selling of newly harvested corn failed to emerge. Soybean futures advanced with the corn market, but wheat moved slightly lower amid slack export demand, analysts said. Wheat settled -LCB- cent to 1 cent lower with December at $ 4.21 -RCB- a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent lower to 5 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.86 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents lower to 2 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.46 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 7 -LCB- cents higher with November at $ 8.10 a bushel. Stock-index futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for December delivery of <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stocks settled 1.45 points lower at 270.50.

 Federal investigators on Tuesday blamed the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet nearly a year ago in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> on the captain's failure to have the jetliner de-iced a second time after it stood in a steady snowfall for 27 minutes. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> also cited the inexperience of the captain and his co-pilot, who was actually flying the aircraft, and the heavy traffic conditions at as contributing factors in the accident. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1713 crashed seconds after lifting off from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Nov. 15, 1987, killing 28 of the 82 people aboard. The pilot and copilot were among those killed. The investigation showed that the <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 had been de-iced but then had to wait for 27 minutes until takeoff because of the heavy traffic flow and what investigators called confusion between the air traffic control tower over where several planes, including Flight 1713, were. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said that the pilots of Flight 1713 ignored a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> operations policy which required them to return for another de-icing whenever an aircraft is delayed at least 20 minutes after having been de-iced in snowy conditions. The safety board in its probable cause said that the failure to de-ice a second time caused an unknown amount of ice `` contamination'' to adhere to the upper wing surface, resulting in a `` loss of control during rapid takeoff rotation by the first officer.'' The safety board cited the inexperience of the 26-year-old co-pilot, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON>, who, the board said, had never flown the DC-9 in snowy conditions and had only 36 hours of experience in jet aircraft. He was piloting during the takeoff. The board said that <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON> lifted the nose of the plane off the runway at too severe an angle, adding to problems the plane already faced in gaining lift because of the ice contamination. The board cited as contributing factors in the accident `` the absence of regulatory or management controls'' over the operations of such pilots. Investigators also said the confusion over the location of Flight 1713 as it awaited takeoff added about nine minutes to the aircraft's delay. The safety board also raised concern about the experience level of the captain of Flight 1713, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Zvonek </PERSON>, 46, noting that he had been a `` high minimum'' captain who was not authorized without special permission to land an aircraft under the type of weather conditions that prevailed on the day of the crash. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Benzon </PERSON>, the board's chief investigator into the accident, said that while technically <PERSON> Zvonek </PERSON> was legally allowed to depart under those weather conditions, he would not have been allowed - except in an emergency - to land under those conditions <PERSON> Zvonek </PERSON> had flown 12,125 hours in all aircraft, but had only 133 hours in a DC-9 co-pilot and 33 hours as a captain, investigators said. <PERSON> Zvonek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON> had never flown together before. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> findings immediately were challenged by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which has maintained all along that the crash was caused by displaced air currents caused by a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 767 jetliner that had landed three minutes before Flght 1713's liftoff on a parallel runway. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for flight operations, said the board produced no evidence to conclusively show ice had developed on the aircraft's wings. `` Our position is that this investigation was not complete,'' he said. But the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> report said the `` wing-tip vortex'' issue _ as the air current phenomenon is called _ had been examined thoroughly and discounted because of the position of the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> jet to the incoming jet at the time Flight 1713 was encountering problems. Much of the board's report on the accident focused on <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON>'s training record, although the panel said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s training procedures had been adequate Most airlines regularly have the captain and first officer, or co-pilot, trade off in taking control of the plane during different flight segments. But since the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> crash, many, including <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, have the flight captain at the controls during the takeoff. According to the investigation, <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON>, had training problems with propeller aircraft before coming to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> in the summer of 1987. In 1985, he was fired by an air taxi company after failing three times to pass his flight examination on a propeller plane despite 30 hours of training, according to investigators. His examiner told the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> that other pilots passed the exam after only half that much training and that <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON> had `` chronic troubles,'' became disoriented and seemed `` unable to cope with deviations from the routine.'' A year later while at <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> commuter carrier, <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON> failed a fight check for a more advanced aircraft and was described by the examiner as `` being behind the airplane.'' After <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> hired <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON> in July 1987 he also encountered difficulties during several sessions of his formal simulator training for operating jet aircraft. During one session in the simulator he `` completely lost control of -LRB- the -RRB- aircraft with engine out at 2,000 feet,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> training report, according to the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>. But after the airline's routine seven simulator sessions on the DC-9, <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON> was sent to the work on the flight lines as a co-pilot. According to a summary of <PERSON> Bruecher </PERSON>'s background check by <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators, the co-pilot felt uneasy about some aspects of flying the DC-9 jet as recently as two weeks before the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> crash.

 <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which saw a 25 percent drop in profits in the second quarter of the year, announced Tuesday a major restructuring of its pharmaceutical business that will cost up to $ 400 million and force the layoff of 1,600 workers. The company also said it will close its <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> drug manufacturing operation, which employs about 800 workers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and international drug sales and research, which had been the three main units of the company's drug business, will be consolidated and headed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, who has been head of the international business since 1985, the company said. Sixty percent of the corporate staff in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> will also be fired. The restructuring will result in annual pretax savings of $ 100 million by the end of 1990, the company said in a press statement. `` Our purpose remains unchanged,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON>, chief executive officer, said. `` We are a technology-driven company pursuing worldwide leadership positions in fast-growing segments of the health care and life sciences markets. `` We are positioning <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, our pharmaceutical business, to receive more focused leadership and attention under a single organization designed to more rapidly commercialize current products and develop and market future products on a worldwide scale,'' he said. Earnings for this year are expected to be $ 3.75 to $ 4 a share, up from a 5 to 10 percent anticipated drop in 1987's $ 4.50-a-share profit, the company said. Also, the company will issue 5 million new shares of <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <PERSON> SmithKline </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON>. The company said in July that it would reorganize its business following a lackluster first-half performance in which earnings dropped by 25 percent. The company also predicted that earnings for the full 1988 fiscal year would be down by 25 percent as well. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> blamed the drop in its profits on the disappointing sales of its two top drugs _ Tagament, an anti-ulcer drug, and Dyazide, a drug used in the treatment of hypertension.

 <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is relocating part of its operations from its <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> office to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in a consolidation that will affect about 125 employees, spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said the regional oil exploration and production office and the partnership operations now based in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> will be merged with company offices in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Borger </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He described the action as `` part of the ongoing effort to improve profitability during this period of low -LRB- crude oil -RRB- prices.'' The <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> office, headquarters for <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' operations in the northwestern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has about 240 employees, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. All but about 30 are in exploration and production.

About 80 <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> employees of those affected are professionals, he said. `` We think the bulk of those professional people will be offered positions,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. He said jobs would be available in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Borger </PERSON> and elsewhere as a result of the consolidation.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> studio is the latest casualty in continued corporate shuffling at <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, under a $ 200 million restructuring announced Tuesday. The complex plan apparently depends on a substantial injection of cash from <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor who owns 79 percent of the show-business congolmerate and has been trading its parts periodically for nearly 20 years. The restructuring a $ 200 million stock rights offering to present stockholders, who would get the right to buy additional new shares in <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, maker of Academy Award-winning `` Moonstruck.'' <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tracinda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which already owns 79 percent of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, intends to buy any of the new shares not bought by other stockholders, the company said. The plan appears similar to <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>'s previous, failed, shuffle of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> in that most of the cash injected into the debt-burdened company would be his through purchase of more shares. The company said it would stop producing all but a few movies under the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> name, consolidating production under <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer </ORGANIZATION>, noted for its roaring lion trademark. He said the <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> movies and other strings of sequels will continue carrying the <LOCATION> UA </LOCATION> name, which also presently appears on `` Betrayed.'' <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> is exploring the possiblity of selling a part-interest in its television production arm, but does not plan to sell the <LOCATION> UA </LOCATION> name or film library, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Silbert </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer. `` That's not under consideration,'' he said, when asked about <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> speculation that <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION> might be up for sale. He refused to discuss a potential investor for <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s TV production unit, which is responsible for the critically-acclaimed series `` thirtysomething,'' among other shows. `` We're at the stage of exploring it, we have n't made a decision,'' <PERSON> Silbert </PERSON> said. Details of the plan to issue new shares to present stockholders have not been worked out, <PERSON> Silbert </PERSON> said, adding that the rights offering was expected to take place near the end of the year. The announcement follows by a day the resignation of <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomopoulos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, resigned in mid-July, and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> resigned as head of the MGM production unit two weeks later. In late July, <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>'s two-week-old plan to split <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION> and sell a part-interest in <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> and two moviemakers fell through for undisclosed reasons. That plan also called for sale of new stock to present shareholders, with <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> buying any unsold shares. Under the new plan, <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s bank debt of between $ 250 million and $ 275 million would be paid by money raised through the stock issue and sale of assets, <PERSON> Silbert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, who bought <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> in 1969, engaged in his biggest shuffle of <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION> assets in 1986 by selling the combined company to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> media entrepreneur <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and then buying back parts over a period of several months. Turner ended up with <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>'s library of classic films, including `` The Wizard of Oz'' and `` Gone with the Wind.'' <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> got the <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION> production companies minus the <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> studio lot, which was sold to <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar-Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

 A federal judge extended on Tuesday his temporary order blocking the purchase of the <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> supermarket chain by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Alpha Beta grocery chain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> said he needed more time to consider the merits of a challenge to the merger by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>. The attorney general had argued that the merger, considered along with the purchase of 172 Safeway supermarkets in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, would cut competition and so drive up prices at the checkout stand. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> issued his temporary order Sept. 7. An extension was required because temporary restraining orders remain in force for 20 days under rules of court procedure. The temporary order bars <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, a nationwide, 1,600-store grocery and drugstore chain, from combining Alpha Beta and Lucky while <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> considers the attorney general's request for a permanent order blocking the purchase.

 <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, the German-based parent of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, plans capital investments totaling $ 470 million to improve General's plants during the next four years, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said Tuesday night. The investments will be in addition to $ 220 million in previously announced capital expenditures. Most of the money will be spent in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, Urban said. Urban said financing for the improvements would come largely from the company's cash flow, with debts of $ 220 million to $ 280 million being incurred. `` The North American market is the most important in the world,'' Urban said. `` All our major customers from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are represented on this continent and also expect us, as suppliers, to manufacture here. Finally, our presence in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> reduces our currency risk.'' General Tire President <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said the planned investment `` demonstrates to General Tire's 10,000 employees <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to the North American market.
