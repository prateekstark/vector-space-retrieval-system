<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> authorized the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> to resume publishing Wednesday following a 15-day suspension imposed for reporting violence at an anti-government protest. But a statement released Tuesday by the ministry said <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>'s directors at a meeting with government officials `` were admonished for constant disrespect for the laws of the nation.'' Also Tuesday, the ministry suspended for 48 hours the radio news program <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguense </ORGANIZATION>. It accused the program directors of broadcasting `` false news'' but did not elaborate. The program is broadcast by the privately owned station <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundial </ORGANIZATION>. The left-wing Sandinista government ordered the suspension of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> on July 12, one day after the newspaper reported a violent police crackdown at a July 10 demonstration in the southern city of <LOCATION> Nandaime </LOCATION>. More than three dozen opposition leaders were detained by police during the demonstration. In ordering the shutdown, the government accused <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> of `` flagrant abuse of the freedom of expression to the detriment of the public order and the interests of the people.'' Also on July 12 the government ordered an indefinite suspension of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION>, the station operated by the Nicaraguan Roman Catholic church, for its reporting of the Nandaime demonstration. <PERSON> Cristiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON>, deputy director of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday night the newspaper rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s claims it had violated laws.

<TEXT>
 A critical test-firing of space shuttle Discovery's three main engines on the launch pad has been put off 24 hours, until Sunday, to give crews more time to seal the engine compartment. A practice countdown, the first of two leading to the firing, was halted Monday when the launch team decided it could not close out the compartment work in time to conduct the test on Saturday as intended. The postponement was announced as engineers assessed two major candidates for fixing a small shuttle gas leak without having to take Discovery off the launch pad, a move that could delay the planned early September launch by as much as two months. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials believe that even if the leak can be fixed on the pad, the launch will be delayed past the middle of September. The two most promising approaches for reaching the inaccessible leak for a launch pad fix are: _ Cutting a hole through the rear wall of the shuttle cargo bay and clamping a clamshell-shaped device over the leak, filling it with a sealant _ Running a flexible tube topped by a badminton-like shuttlecock through the 20-foot gas line, filling in the area behind the shuttlecock with a sealant Tests of both systems have been promising, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Shuttle managers were scheduled to meet again Thursday to consider the latest test findings.

<HEAD>Fraud, Abuse Increase with Number of Financial Planners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The explosion in the number of financial planners in the 1980s has been matched by a surge in fraud and abuse, state securities regulators told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, in a report to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on consumer affairs, said losses to fraud and abuse totaled $ 397 million between mid-1986 and mid-1988. The losses were suffered by 22,100 investors in 79 separate cases pursued by officials in 30 states. That compares with $ 91 million lost in 31 cases between mid-1983 and mid-1985, the association said. `` The absence of effective national oversight of the financial planning industry has created an enormous opportunity for con artists and ... -LRB- others -RRB- who have few scruples about how they earn their living,'' the association said. The group, which represents regulators in all 50 states, said an `` alarming rise'' in large swindles contributed to the increase. It also said more aggressive enforcement probably led to more cases being uncovered. `` Most disturbing is that we are seeing a substantial surge in the number of ` big ticket' cases with investor losses in the eight-figure range,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s top securities regulator and president of the association. A 1985 association survey turned up only one case where investors lost more than $ 10 million, while the latest check found five cases where losses totaled more than $ 30 million. With the proliferation of investment options in recent years, millions of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> have turned to financial planners for advice on saving for retirement, college education or buying a house. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> requires companies offering advice concerning securities to register as investment advisers. But, in contrast to stock brokers, who are required to pass an exam, there are no educational standards. Also, financial planners offering advice that does not involve buying securities do not have to register. Neither do lawyers and accountants whose advice is incidental to their work. And, individuals can work for a registered planner without registering themselves. Another contentious issue is how financial planners, who are supposed to offer independent advice, are paid. Some work only for fees paid by their customers. But, according to an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> study in February, 85 percent are compensated at least in part through commissions on what they sell. In May, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> censured and suspended a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> firm for failing to disclose it received commissions for the securities it recommended. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, says its membership has tripled from the end of 1982 to about 25,000. It estimates there are as many as 150,000 financial planners overall. About 13,000 firms have registered with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> as investment advisers. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, a financial planner in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and chairman-elect of the association, said his group has been pushing for more federal regulation, including the creation of a self-regulatory organization similar to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees brokers who trade over-the-counter stocks. `` We're talking here about rotten apples and my feeling is we should get those rotten apples out of the barrel,'' he said. `` One of the things I'm concerned about in this business is that somebody can call himself a financial planner with impunity.'' In a related matter, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to consider a rule Thursday which would require investment advisers to keep records for five years to back up performance claims made in their advertising. The 30 states included in the most recent <ORGANIZATION> NASAA </ORGANIZATION> survey were: <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> were not included in the 1985 survey. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> were part of the earlier study, but not the 1988 survey.

<HEAD>Promotion of Blacks Lags in Navy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is studying why the promotion of blacks in its ranks lags behind that of the other services, 40 years after President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> ordered the nation's military to integrate. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has launched an intensive two-month study to report to Chief of Naval Operations Adm. <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> on why the service has so few black officers and why so many blacks are subject to disciplinary action. The study was initiated at the suggestion of Vice Admiral <PERSON> L.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edney </PERSON>, chief of naval personnel. `` Progress has slowed. We need to find out why,'' <PERSON> Edney </PERSON> said at a convention of the mostly black Naval Officers' Association earlier this month in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The review coincides with the 40th anniversary today of <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s Executive Order 9981 for `` equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed forces without regard to race, color, religion or national origin. The road has been slow, especially in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The number of black officers in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has grown from 254 in 1965 to 2,518 today. But that means that only 3.4 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s officers are black, far behind the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s rate of 10.3 percent, and the 6.6 percent in the military as a whole. In the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, 5.4 percent of the officers are black, and in the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, 5.4 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> goal is to reach 6 percent by 1996. That would be quite a change for a service which declared as recently as 1933 that blacks would be accepted only as mess stewards and which did not name its first black admiral, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gravely </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, until 1971, according to the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rolls now list six black admirals, two of them promoted this year. The highest ranking black in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is two-star Rear Adm. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hacker </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base and naval training center at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, a major port for the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> fleet. `` While we have experienced significant growth in numbers and opportunities for minority personnel, we have clearly not met all of our challenges,'' <PERSON> Edney </PERSON> said in his speech, given July 8. `` Despite our best efforts, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> still suffers from shortages in minority officer accessions, officer promotions, enlisted advancement and _ while lower than past years _ slightly higher minority involvement with uniform code of military justice violations,' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has ordered a separate report, due by the end of the year, to determine why the court-martial rate for blacks last year was 1.65 percent compared to 1.34 percent for all naval personnel. Within two months, a task force is to report to <PERSON> Edney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> on ways to improve the promotion of blacks in the service. <PERSON> Edney </PERSON> proclaimed a commitment to `` keep equal opportunity on the front burner as a top priority. It is the right thing to do. Equal opportunity is fundamental to good leadership, morale and discipline.'' The white majority of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers, he said, have `` a natural tendency to be less sensitive to the perceptions and human needs of minorities, be they minorities of race, religion or gender.'' `` Top leaders must recognize this tendency and not tolerate such insensitivity. We must have checks and balances to make sure the chain of command is responsive,'' <PERSON> Edney </PERSON> said. The admiral promised that `` this will not be just another study of equal opportunity programs. It will be a hard, introspective look.''

<HEAD>Drought Cuts Duck Population</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government biologists are discussing a 25 percent cutback in duck hunting seasons this fall, saying drought has produced `` the worst habitat conditions'' biologists have ever seen. Reduced hunting is one suggestion that advisory committees are being asked to consider before the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> holds hearings early next month on guidelines for states to use in adopting actual hunting regulations. Also put up for discussion, spokeswoman <PERSON> Megan </PERSON> <PERSON> Durham </PERSON> said Monday, are a three-bird bag limit _ the typical recent limit has been four _ and an early closing of the period when hunting is permissible, Jan. 1 instead of Jan. 20. In other drought-related activity in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wrote key members of agriculture committees in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that some features of a bipartisan drought relief bill for farmers might violate principles he believes should be followed. The president did not say specifically what troubled him, but during a tour of drought-stricken corn and soybean producing areas in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> earlier this month, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> voiced concern that the relief package might take on the appearance of a `` Christmas tree,'' in which lawmakers attach favored amendments on legislation they know will pass the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The advisory committees' discussion is beginning with a prediction by the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> that the fall duck migration will total 66 million ducks, second lowest behind only the 62 million of 1985. All the reduction from last year's 74 million will come in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and Central flyways. The migration on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> flyways is expected to be unchanged. The service has warned several times that hunting most likely would have to be restricted this fall, not only because of this year's drought but also because of drought throughout most of the 1980s in the marshy breeding areas of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the northern plains states. The early-season guidelines for blue-winged teal hunting in September call for canceling the season outright in 13 states and for major reductions elsewhere. Last week, the service released population counts showing the breeding populations of 10 major duck species down 3.7 percent from 1987 and 17 percent below the long-term 1955-1987 average. The Northern pintail duck is at a record low of 2.58 million, 18 percent fewer than in 1987 and 54 percent below average. `` Biologists are beginning to worry that continued low water conditions in the areas waterfowl use for migration stopovers and wintering will concentrate the birds and make them more vulnerable to disease later this year,'' the service said in a survey of drought problems as seen by its biologists around the country. There are fewer statistics on non-duck species, but the service reported the <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> has been turned into a `` river of sand,'' exposing the nesting piping plover and the interior least tern to threats of predators and death of aquatic food species. Pheasant, quail and grouse may not be affected until next spring, when they'll have less cover during nesting season. Some other highlights from the survey: _ Geese are faring better than ducks, since they nest on more permanent wetlands and are better able to protect their young from predators _ Federal hatcheries in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> report rising water temperatures are increasing mortality of young trout and on Monday, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> state hatcheries were reported rushing 600,000 fish to the state's cooler streams a month earlier than usual _ Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> biologists on the Great Lakes report flows on tributaries are so low they can not safely apply chemicals to control lamprey, which prey on lake trout, and that dredging necessitated by low water will spread contaminated bottom sediment, threatening other aquatic life _ Without significant rain soon, a near-total failure of the acorn crop from oak trees in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and South will occur, spelling problems for deer, squirrels and wild turkey dependent on acorns for food _ All 750 seedlings of the green pitcher plant, an endangered species planted by the service in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> this spring, have been killed The duck population surveys recorded increases and in some cases record numbers of ducks in northern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. This means they could n't find suitable wetland areas further south, and may not have the energy left to breed at all after their longer flights. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON>, director of the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said last week he expects increased emphasis on habitat management. He said marshland managed specifically for waterfowl has provided the only relief for ducks and other species dependent on prairie wetlands.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> says he hopes to curb <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> purchasing abuses by ordering new limits on the number of `` final offers'' that defense contractors can make on a single deal. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said at a news conference Monday that he was surprised to learn how frequently companies were allowed to revise supposedly final bids, although he described it as `` the exception'' rather than the rule. In the past, contractors have been allowed to amend their final offers in consultation with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to change prices or technical specifications to meet military needs. The Pentagon has been rocked in recent weeks by allegations that private consultants working for defense contractors bribed top military purchasing officials for secret contract information. Many of the alleged abuses disclosed in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation involve contractors who, through the consultants, learned the price or other specifics of bids by competing companies, and then submitted a new `` best and final offer'' tailored to win contracts, some of them worth billions of dollars. `` It is the ` best and final offer' that seems to us to create the most intensive point in the competitive cycle. And that means that information is at a premium,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` We intend to continue with our competitive process. But when you repeat it once, twice, or three times, then it can readily become subject to abuse,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who was scheduled to testify before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today, also said his aides had drawn up a `` protocol'' for the military to follow as more information is disclosed from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the department has: _ Required that 17 companies implicated in the investigation certify they did not engage in `` illegal or improper activity'' to obtain a defense contract; _ Required those 17 to agree, in any new contract greater than $ 100,000, to include a clause allowing the government to recover profits or 10 percent of the contract value if the deal is tainted; _ Started procedures to lift the security clearances of six people, including one suspended without pay from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and five others transferred to other duties pending results of the investigation; _ Sent letters to the top 200 defense contractors urging them to implement strong internal ethics programs, `` stringent management controls, and asking them to report back to us on their self-governance programs;'' _ Reviewed federal acquisition regulations to tighten controls on consultants employed by defense contractors; _ Formed an audit task force to review the cost imposed on the military budget by consultants <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the certification requirement was being applied only to the 17 implicated companies to avoid penalizing contractors who were not under suspicion. `` This is a rifle action. It is not a shotgun action,'' he said. `` We are directing this at certain contractors. We do not intend to apply it indiscriminately, because it does impose a burden on people. `` And where there are burdens, there are costs, and those costs may come back to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayer,'' he said. `` It is only where we have reason to believe that people are under suspicion that we are doing this.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> declined to identify people whose security clearances were being lifted, saying only that `` we are taking steps to revoke the security clearances of individuals who have been involved in illegal or improper actions.'' In a related development, the White House announced that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> intends to nominate <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lohr </PERSON> to the new position of deputy undersecretary of defense for acquisition. Since 1983, <PERSON> Lohr </PERSON> has been president of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is praising Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> at a time when <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> is encountering opposition to a sweeping U.S.-Canadian free-trade pact. At the same time, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had kind words Monday for a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that often has come in for his criticism, saying lawmakers had put the agreement `` on a fast track'' _ just as he asked. The setting for the president's remarks was a Roosevelt Room ceremony at which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed letters transmitting to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> legislation to implement the agreement. `` Throughout North American history, whenever and wherever trade barriers have been lowered, we've seen our economies bloom like mountain meadows after a spring rain,'' the president said. `` This agreement is a sun rising on a new morning of economic vitality,'' he said. `` It will save <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers up to $ 3 billion a year. It will help keep the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> economy growing for a generation to come.'' On Jan. 2, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> signed an agreement that provides for the elimination of all tariffs in the two countries' $ 150 billion-a-year trade. It also would reduce many non-tariff barriers, liberalize investment practices and provide new rules covering cross-border trade in services. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not allude to the political situation in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> opposition has threatened to stall legislation implementing the accord there until <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> calls new elections. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> quoted his Canadian counterpart as saying, `` The choice could n't be more clear-cut _ the voices of the past against a vision of the future.'' `` I asked the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to put this on a fast track, which it did, and then some,'' he said. -LRB- Auto racing driver -RRB- <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mears </PERSON> could n't have driven it any faster, which shows what we can do when Democrats and Republicans work together.'' The accord ran into trouble last week in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> when the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> vowed to block ratification until <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> calls a general election. But <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, in a heated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> exchange </ORGANIZATION>, rejected demands for an immediate election to settle the free-trade issue _ a debate that has divided Canadians for a century. `` At an appropriate time, there will be an election,'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said last Wednesday. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did not believe <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would comment `` on the internal affairs of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in terms of their elections.'' However, he said, `` we're still hopeful that they proceed with the Free Trade Agreement and that they'll be able to get that passed up there as well.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said he hoped <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> would not amend or modify the agreement. He said he did not know whether such a move would require a renegotiation of the treaty. The Free Trade Agreement is scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1, 1989, provided <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> pass implementing legislation. The changes will be phased in during a 10-year period. The House of Commons approved it in principle July 6 and has scheduled a third and final reading in mid-August after committee hearings. The legislation then goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which has a large <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> majority. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s two opposition parties, the Liberals and socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, have accuse <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> of sacrificing the nation's sovereignty But <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> claims the deal will create prosperity and shield <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> protectionism.

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> completed his sixth year in office just a few days ago, and it's hard to recall a time during that period when things looked better for him. East European nations are showing an increasing tendency to diversify their diplomatic contacts, reflected in planned visits to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week by <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Olechowski </PERSON>. Years have passed since either of these Soviet allies sent high-level visitors to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In southwestern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, prospects have never seemed brighter for the withdrawal of Cuban and South African troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and for Namibian independence from South African colonial rule. Pushed along by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediation effort, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> have agreed to a statement of principle governing future negotiations and are to meet next week to discuss a timetable for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the region. As <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> sees it, the withdrawal of Cuban forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> will free the area of superpower competition for the first time since the Cubans began arriving there in 1975. In addition, a South African pullback from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> would create conditions for independent rule in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s last colony. Perhaps the best news for <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> lately is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s decision to accept the terms of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution aimed at ending the 20th Century's longest major war. The administration has been working hard to encourage negotiated settlements in both southwestern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. And administration officials in recent days have been feeling heady about the progress in both areas. But it's difficult to say whether these gains are the result of administration policy or just plain war weariness among the combatants. The fighting in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> dates back to the early 1960s; the war in the gulf has claimed more than 1 million lives. Even <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is showing a far friendlier face to the outside world these days. Vietnamese forces have occupied neighboring <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> for more than nine years, but <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has promised to withdraw 50,000 troops this year and the rest in two years. It also has demonstrated a far more forthcoming attitude toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on such issues as accounting for the nearly 2,400 American servicemen still listed as missing from the Vietnam War and its treatment of former officials identified with the former U.S.-backed regime in <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>. An American team of technical experts is in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> for discussions on arrangements for joint on-site inspections to help resolve the fate of the missing Americans. All this raises the possibility of eventual diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> for the first time since North <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> became independent more than 30 years ago. For now, however, the administration refuses even to discuss that possibility, waiting instead for a complete Vietnamese withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and a satisfactory accounting of <ORGANIZATION> MIA </ORGANIZATION>'s. On at least two issues, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is unable to claim progress. His efforts to promote Arab-Israeli peace talks have not borne fruit. In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, although a fragile cease-fire remains in place, the peace process is at an impasse and there is talk once again of renewed American military aid to the Contras. Still, the world seems like a far less contentious place to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> than it was at the time of the last presidential election. In those days, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was able to cite the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> victory over the <ORGANIZATION> Grenadan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> as an achievement but not much else. That was before the rise of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, a time when Democrats were criticizing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for being the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president in more than 50 years who had not met with a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader. That was four Soviet-American summits ago.

<HEAD>Political Debate Over Free Trade Has Parallel In 1911 Election</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX8</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For the second time this century, political furor over free trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could force a <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> government out of office. The precedent was set in 1911 when long-serving Liberal Prime Minister Sir <PERSON> Wilfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurier </PERSON> proposed free trade but was pressured into an early election and defeated by the Conservatives. The roles are reversed this time. A Conservative prime minister, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, has negotiated the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, while the Liberal opposition claims the deal will turn <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> into little more than a resource base for the Americans. The agreement to dismantle duties and non-tariff barriers over a 10-year period is scheduled to take effect Jan. 1. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presented final legislation Monday to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> is expected to approve the deal in August. In a bid to halt the ratification process, <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> played his final card last week. The Commons member asked the Liberal-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, an appointed chamber that can delay and amend legislation, not to consider the bill until <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> calls an election on the issue. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> accused Turner of hijacking the authority of elected members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> _ meaning the Commons where Conservatives hold 207 of the 282 seats. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s argument is that <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> has no mandate for entering a treaty that radically changes the future of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. In 1983, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> spoke against free trade and the issue was not part of the Conservative election platform in 1984. `` The agreement should not go into effect until the people of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> have had the opportunity to vote -LRB- on it -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who maintains that such a pact would make <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> subservient to its giant neighbor. He urged <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> to call a September election, one year before his five-year term expires. That would provide enough time to implement the agreement if voters return <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> to office. The Liberals would tear up the deal if they win, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. Polls show Canadians divided 50-50 on the issue and in favor of an election. But <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> reacted calmly to what he termed <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s `` act of desperation'' and said he has a full legislative agenda to complete before an election. He got a political boost Monday when a prominent Liberal, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Roggen </PERSON>, resigned as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> so he could speak out in favor of free trade. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s camp hoped more Liberals would break ranks. `` There's a lot bubbling around here and we'll have to wait and see what kind of stew comes out of the pot,'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a top <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> aide, said. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> has put a helluva lot of pressure on a lot of senators.'' <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s second opposition party, the socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, dislikes free trade. But party leader <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> has accused Turner of abandoning democracy by using the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to impede the will of the elected <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The Conservatives have climbed steadily in the polls this year, while the other two parties have slumped. For <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, deploying the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is a gamble because he gave the Conservatives two diversionary election issues: his judgment in defying elected legislators and the need for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reform. `` The election outcome may very well be determined more by people's feelings about the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> than about free trade,'' columnist <ORGANIZATION> Orland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> wrote Monday in The Globe and Mail, the national newspaper. The situation has many parallels with 1911. The Conservatives then stirred up public opinion with the slogan `` No truck nor trade with the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>'' and filibustered for five months to force <PERSON> Laurier </PERSON> into an early election. Then, as now, the government had not included free trade in its election platform. But in 1911, the Conservatives did not use the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to stop the treaty.

 More than 300,000 <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> automobiles are under investigation to determine if hundreds of reports of unintended acceleration are true, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says. The agency said Monday it had broadened its probe into allegations that the vehicles speed up without the operator's intervention to encompass 309,000 cars made by Mercedes from 1984 through 1988 The cars are all equipped with gasoline engines and automatic transmissions. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> in October had begun an investigation into 42,353 1986-1987 Mercedes Model 124 300E cars. The new engineering analysis broadens the regulatory case to include the Mercedes models 107 SL, 126 SE, SEL and <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, and 201 190E. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said it has received reports of 301 instances of sudden acceleration in the Mercedes cars. The agency said 217 of the instances reportedly resulted in accidents that injured 92 people and killed one person. <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will cooperate fully with the <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> investigation, said A.B. <PERSON> Schuman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the company in <LOCATION> Montvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. He said in the company's investigation of 283 sudden-acceleration reports, `` our technicians have never found any electrical, electronic or mechanical defect in our cars that could cause unintended acceleration.'' The Mercedes case is among six <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> investigations into alleged sudden acceleration involving at least 4.8 million vehicles. Other makers and the number of vehicles involved are <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 3.2 million; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 800,000; <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>, 255,000; <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>, 183,000; and <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, 62,500. The Mercedes investigation was opened at the request of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer group often at odds with the auto industry and its regulators. `` The steady increase in sudden acceleration incidents in numerous Mercedes models other than the 1986-87 300E demonstrates that Mercedes' entire line of recent-year gasoline engine cars with automatic transmissions is affected by this defect,'' the center said. The center said it had received 164 reports of sudden acceleration in Mercedes cars, resulting in 125 accidents, 46 injuries and one death.

<HEAD>USDA Says Peanut Program Hikes Prices But Keeps Quality High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government's peanut program restricts production and causes `` somewhat higher retail prices,'' says an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist. But the program also helps provide `` a steady, high-quality supply of peanuts for consumers'' through a two-tiered price support system, says <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The two-tier system is scheduled to continue at least through the 1990 peanut marketing year. It involves a support rate for peanuts grown under a national quota, and a much lower rate for peanuts grown in addition to the quota. Quota peanuts are sold for domestic food and related uses, while the `` additional'' peanuts are used for export or crushing into oil and meal. <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON>, whose analysis is in the current <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>, said net outlays by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> averaged $ 10 million annually between 1982 and 1986, well below the average of $ 30 million during the 1960s and the $ 61 million of the 1970s. `` The current program is expected to keep costs to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayers to a minimum because the program is designed for quota production to equal domestic food and related demand,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> acknowledged that the peanut program could cost substantially more if the national marketing quota greatly exceeded what processors want to buy at the quota rate. Should that happen, the government would wind up buying the unwanted peanuts and hold them as surplus. The 1988 price support, or loan rate, is $ 615.27 per ton for peanuts grown within a farmer's quota. The support for additional peanuts is $ 149.75 per ton. Farmers put their crop in storage arranged by grower associations. The peanuts then are pooled and controlled by the associations and the CCC. If the association sells the peanuts at a profit, growers participating in that pool are eligible for dividend payments. If the peanuts can not be sold on the market at the quota price, the CCC is obligated to buy them at the quota rate. <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> said the peanut program does raise consumer prices and lower supplies by supporting farmers' prices and setting quota. But it's difficult to say what prices would be without the program. `` We do know that the break-even price for peanuts _ the longrun average price needed for growers to recover all production costs _ was about $ 420 -LRB- per ton -RRB- in 1986,'' he said. `` Therefore, a free market price would likely be closer to $ 420 than the $ 607-a-ton quota loan rate set for that year.'' But <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> added that even these numbers can be questioned because the peanut programs _ which go back to 1934 _ have existed so long that farmers have altered production and marketing practices accordingly. Americans consume an average of about 8.5 pounds of peanuts a year, on a per capita basis, including peanut butter and candy, as well as roasted, salted and from the shell. <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> said the government programs probably have not had a significant impact on peanut demand, at least partly because there are few good, comparably priced substitutes. In other words, he said, lower prices would not necessarily mean substantially greater consumption.

 A 26-mile stretch of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 64 in southeastern <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> is the first segment of a new National Forest Scenic Byways system set up by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said Monday the byway is located in the <ORGANIZATION> Cherokee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and passes through scenic areas dominated by rock bluffs, mountain peaks and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocoee </LOCATION>. The byway also offers ready access to white-water rafting, boating, swimming and historical sites related to the Civil War and the Cherokee Indian culture, he said. The program was begun this summer `` to increase the scenic enjoyment of the millions of people who drive through national forests each year,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. Despite a variety of more active recreational activities, driving for pleasure remains the most popular in the nation's 156 national forests located in 43 states, he said. Various groups are working with the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency to place interpretive signs, develop brochures and provide facilities designed to make a drive through the forests more enjoyable, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said.

 The nation's hens worked a little harder last month, but because of fewer birds the extra effort fell short of the year-ago production mark, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. June output was estimated at 5.52 billion eggs, down 2 percent from June 1987, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Meanwhile, the number of hens in laying flocks declined 3 percent during the month to an average of 269 million birds. Individually, however, the fewer hens shelled out more eggs _ an average of 2,054 eggs per 100 birds during June, up from 2,033 a year earlier, the report said.

 Some $ 46 million in public money to finance <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Democratic presidential campaign is being held up temporarily by a tangle over running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s dual campaigns for vice president and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> filed a complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> alleging that any money <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spends on his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> re-election bid in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> will directly benefit the party's presidential ticket and give it an unfair advantage over the Republicans. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> was considering the matter today. Commission spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said the commission has 10 days to decide how to handle the unprecedented issue. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign filed its request for the money late Friday, and the existence of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> complaint will add to the time it takes to release the federal campaign funds, she said. <PERSON> Jann </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsten </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee, said at a news conference Monday that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is poised to spend more than $ 4 million on his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> re-election campaign at the same time he is running for vice president. An unusual <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law permits <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to seek both offices simultaneously. `` There is no denying that one -LRB- race -RRB- is going to impact the other,'' <ORGANIZATION> Olsten </ORGANIZATION> said. `` A dollar spent by Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, whether for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or the vice presidential campaign, is going to directly and immediately benefit both ... It just is n't fair.'' The 1976 law that created public financing for presidential campaigns stipulates that candidates who receive the federal money can not accept private funds for their campaigns. The $ 46 million each for the Democratic and Republican tickets comes from a $ 1 check-off on individual income tax returns. The <ORGANIZATION> NRSC </ORGANIZATION>, in a complaint filed Friday with the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>, asked that the government withhold the federal campaign funds until it either bars the spending of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign chest or determines to count any <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign spending against the $ 46 million limit. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opponent, Rep. <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, said at a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> news conference that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> intends to circumvent the law and should either bow out of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race or not spend money raised for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race. `` Nobody expects him to do either,'' <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> said. `` He wants it both ways.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVore </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s legal advisers had researched the issue and believed there was no problem with conducting and financing both campaigns, and said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> was trying to win a free ride for <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>. `` They know the <ORGANIZATION> Bentsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign would help the national ticket whether Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was part of the ticket or not,'' <PERSON> DeVore </PERSON> said. `` What they're really saying is they're scared silly.'' <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> noted that the only other case involving a similiar, but not parallel situation, was in 1976 when <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> ran for president and for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The commission at that time was asked to rule on whether he could spend the legal limit for both his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and presidential primary race. The decision was that he could not because he would gain a ` ` significant publicity advantage'' over his rivals by spending more money overall throughout <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> But that ruling is not a good precedent for this case because there are no limits on <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign spending any more and the issues are different, said <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>. `` It was a different legal situation,'' she said. The current case is more likely to revolve around how various campaign expenses are paid for _ such things as whether <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign photos of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could be paid out of his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> fund or would be considered presidential expenditures. Another potential gray area might involve which campaign would pay for signs stating `` Vote Bentsen'' without any further indication of what office was being referenced. <ORGANIZATION> Olsten </ORGANIZATION> said if the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> should rule against the Republican complaint it was likely that the party would seek a federal court injunction to halt the flow of federal campaign money. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s latest <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign report shows he has $ 3.9 million in cash on hand for his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race. Since the beginning of 1987, he has raised more than $ 6 million.

 Business is booming at the nation's movie theaters this summer with hits like `` Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' producing revenues running well ahead of last year's record $ 4.2 billion take. `` The business is really rolling along. It's got momentum because there's variety, a selection for every taste,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Exhibitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. With the completion of eight weeks of the traditionally rich summer season, more than $ 934 million worth of tickets have been sold, 13 percent more than for the period last year. The industry trade paper <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variety </ORGANIZATION> said when all the receipts are tallied the summer box office may reach $ 1.7 billion compared with $ 1.59 billion a year ago. Analysts attributed the revenue gains to the diversity of this summer's films _ ranging from mindless comedies, animated and partially-animated films and violent, action-packed fare. `` When you have many popular films, you have a great summer,'' said Variety's <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. `` You notice there are no films that did $ 10 million or more. That's because there is competition. It's the quality of product.'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>'s collaboration with <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, `` Who Framed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>,'' featuring the technological wizardry of live and animated characters, regained the No. 1 position at the nation's box offices last weekend with a take of $ 8.9 million. It nudged out last week's top film `` Coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The second-place <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> film earned $ 8.8 million, just $ 33,000 shy of the leader. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>' `` Die Hard'' was third, <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>'s `` Dead Pool'' was fourth, the <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeNiro-Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grodin </PERSON> comedy `` Midnight Run'' was fifth and the re-release of the 46-year-old Disney classic `` Bambi'' was sixth. The mindless `` Big Top Pee-wee'' faired poorly in its debut, bringing in $ 4.6 million to place seventh, and `` Caddyshack II'' was eighth with $ 4.4 million. The <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> hit `` Big,'' placing ninth, maintained its stature after eight weeks of release by adding $ 3.9 million in receipts for a total gross of $ 75.2 million. `` Bull Durham'' rounded out the top 10 with $ 2.4 million. Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in release and estimated production costs when available. 1. `` Who Framed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>,'' Disney, $ 8.92 million, 1,402 screens, $ 6,362 per screen, $ 84.1 million, five weeks, $ 40 million. 2. `` Coming To <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' Paramount, $ 8.89 million, 2,064 screens, $ 4,305 per screen, $ 81.2 million, four weeks, $ 20 million. 3. `` Die Hard,'' 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, $ 7.1 million, 1,276 screens, $ 5,569 per screen, $ 10.1 million, two weeks, n-a. 4. `` The Dead Pool,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 6.0 million, 1,831 screens, $ 3,285 per screen, $ 23.1 million, two weeks, $ 18 million. 5. `` Midnight Run,'' Universal, $ 5.5 million, 1,158 screens, $ 4,775 per screen, $ 7.1 million, one week, n-a. 6. `` Bambi,'' <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, $ 5.3 million, 1,489 screens, $ 3,570 per screen, $ 18.3 million, two weeks, $ 2 million -LRB- in 1942 -RRB-. 7. `` Big Top Pee-wee,'' Paramount, $ 4.6 million, 1,256 screens, $ 3,682 per screen, $ 4.6 million, one week, n-a. 8. `` Caddyshack II,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 4.4 million, 1,556 screens, $ 2,851 per screen, $ 4.4 million, one week, n-a. 9. `` Big,'' 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, $ 3.9 million, 1,276 screens, $ 3,060 per screen, $ 75.3 million, eight weeks, $ 15 million. 10. `` Bull Durham,'' <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>, $ 2.4 million, 1,019 screens, $ 2,371 per screen, $ 36.3 million, six weeks, $ 12 million.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is maintaining his hybrid schedule of Statehouse duties and presidential campaigning by tending to gubernatorial tasks today, including a law-and-order event. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was spending most of today at the office, with a visit to a new police post at a downtown subway stop to swear in six new members of the state transit authority police force. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor spent all of Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION>, putting aside state business for an hour-long meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> before the communist leader headed to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to meet President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Wednesday also was to be a Statehouse day for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who kicks off an eight-state campaign swing Thursday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> kept a low profile Monday, refusing to comment as he walked <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> out of his office to an elevator surrounded by reporters. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> is the first East European communist party leader to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 10 years and the first <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> leader to visit this country in more than 40 years. At the top of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' state agenda is legislative unrest with some of the $ 138 million in planned spending <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vetoed from the state's fiscal 1989 budget. Some lawmakers, irate over the slashing of $ 91 million in local aid, have asked the legislative leadership to halt a summer recess so they can attempt to override the vetoes. `` Not to worry _ all is well,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said when asked Monday afternoon to discuss a meeting between the administration's top budget officer and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Keverian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' schedule this week fits with his primary season practice of spending Monday through Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> before heading out to campaign. He is expected to continue that pattern through much of the general election campaign. The tentative schedule for this week's trip includes stops in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, took a weekend campaign trip with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> but was not scheduled to campaign with the governor this week.

<TEXT>
 A one-time police chief, a former white supremacist leader and three other men have been charged in what prosecutors say was a scheme to pass $ 100,000 in counterfeit money to raise money for paramilitary organizations. The federal indictment revealed Monday accuses <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickstrom </PERSON>, 45, with attempting to buy conterfeit $ 20 and $ 50 bills through <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON>, a chiropractor in <LOCATION> Cambria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, about 70 miles east of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wickstrom </PERSON>, who was arrested June 24, is a former leader of the supremacist group, Posse Comitatus. At a hearing June 29, <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddington </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wickstrom </PERSON> planned to pass the fake bills for genuine currency overseas to help support right-wing, paramilitary organizations.

 Disturbances broke out among inmates at a maximum-security prison, injuring eight guards, a prison psychologist and three inmates, authorities said. `` It appears to be under control,'' <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Starnes </PERSON>, assistant press secretary to Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, said about an hour after ambulances were sent to the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. State Police spokesman Cpl. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said no prisoners escaped. <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> met Monday night with the prison warden and state prison officials, and said afterward that he was satisfied with their handling of the disturbance. <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said the disturbance began in the recreation yard shortly before 1 p.m, spread to a crisis clinic where the psychologist was having a session with inmates, and erupted again in another section of the yard. He said a minor fire also was set in the clinic. <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> police carrying shotguns immediately surrounded the perimeter of the prison, and a police helicopter flew overhead. Several downtown streets were blocked off, causing traffic backups. Prison officials did not know the reason for the three incidents and do not think they were organized, <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said. Two homemade knives were recovered, and several gunshots also were fired, he said. Officials said the prison immediately was `` locked down,'' with inmates locked in their cells. Two inmates, one in critical condition and one in fair, were being treated for gunshot wounds, said <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Hisley </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON>. The third inmate was being treated at the prison hospital, which handles less-serious injuries, officials said. One of the eight injured guards suffered a gunshot wound to the neck, but authorities believe he may have been wounded by another officer during the melee. He and two other guards were hospitalized, while the others were treated and released. The psychologist was treated for facial injuries and released. The problem apparently resulted from an altercation that possibly followed an aborted escape attempt, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowlander </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> 92 of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, which represents correctional officers. The penitentiary, which opened in 1811, ordinarily holds 700 to 800 men, but Monday's inmate count was 1,270. Eighteen of its inmates are on death row.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> called a Central American peace plan a regional `` declaration of independence'' but accused <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> of not fulfilling obligations under the year-old effort. Also Monday, guerrillas set fire to a bowling alley in the capital to retaliate after police dispersed an anti-government march, the manager said. No one was reported hurt and no group claimed responsibility for the attack. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, 62, appeared energetic Monday during his first news conference since he returned to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> July 11 after six weeks of medical treatment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He is suffering from terminal liver cancer and doctors give him six to 18 months more to live. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government of not adhering to terms of the peace plan signed Aug. 7 in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> by the five Central American presidents. The plan calls for negotiations between governments and insurgents to end civil wars in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. It also calls for amnesties for politically motivated crimes, moves toward democratization and a ban on outside support for guerrilla movements. The plan `` has fulfilled many of its objectives and must be considered a declaration of principles and, for me, it has been a second declaration of independence for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said. `` In the short term, some of the plan's objectives have been fulfilled, and some have not been fulfilled,'' he said, without elaborating. `` <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, in signing -LRB- the accord -RRB-, made an appearance of trying to put it into practice, but obviously that put it into confrontation with democracy,'' he added. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> accused the Sandinistas of supporting leftist Salvadoran guerrillas battling his U.S.-backed government. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s government declared an amnesty for political crimes and lifted a state of emergency to comply with the peace initiative. But there have been no talks between the government and rebels since October. The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> meet Aug. 1 in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to discuss the plan's achievements and shortcomings. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said there are no plans for a meeting of presidents to mark the initiative's first anniversary. Meanwhile, 10 to 12 masked men with pistols and at least one submachine gun set fire to a bowling alley after taking money from about 30 patrons and identifying themselves as `` urban commandos'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Faribundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, manager of the <PERSON> Bolerama </PERSON> <PERSON> Jardin </PERSON>. The front, a coalition of five guerrilla groups, has waged an 8-year-old war against the government. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said the guerrillas took `` money they said was a ` contribution' to the cause. They said the attack was in reprisal for the government's repression of Thursday's march.'' The guerrillas then doused several pool tables in a room adjoining the main bowling area with gasoline and set them afire, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said. Firefighters arrived within 15 minutes and extinguished the blaze. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said none of the bowling alley's owners has any connection with the government and that he did not understand why the business was targeted. On Thursday last week, police used tear gas and fired shots in the air to break up an anti-government demonstration in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Protesters then burned at least nine vehicles. Human rights groups estimate more than 65,000 people have been killed in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> since the civil war began in October 1979.

 A judge has scheduled an impeachment trial for an 85-year-old mayor who last week donned a turban and rubber snakes while declaring `` National Voodoo Week.'' But an attorney for Florala Mayor H.T. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> said the trial is moot because the mayor's four-year term ends Oct. 3. `` Really I think he is more interested in clearing his name than anything else,'' said attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestwood </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Covington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> on Monday refused to dismiss charges of neglect of duty, corruption and incompetency, and set an Aug. 29 trial date. Last week, while clad in a turban and rubber snakes, <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> proclaimed `` National Voodoo Week'' at a midnight news conference on the steps of the county courthouse. The mayor said `` National Voodoo Week'' was aimed at promoting publicity for the town and peace among the residents. Attorney General <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegelman </PERSON> has accused <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> of mismanagement and improperly pardoning about two dozen drunken drivers in <LOCATION> Florala </LOCATION>, a town of about 2,200 residents on the <LOCATION> Alabama-Florida </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> has said he has pardoned numerous DUI convictions because of what he calls overzealous police officers. <PERSON> Siegelman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>' `` voodoo antics'' may be an issue at the trial. <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Siegelman </PERSON> had no right to ask a judge to empanel the county grand jury that returned the impeachment recommendation. <PERSON> Prestwood </PERSON> said he was `` absolutely optimistic'' that <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> would be found innocent at the impeachment trial, but may seek a delay to prepare for the trial.

Police Lt. <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Naguit </PERSON> said a car sped by <PERSON> Blackmer </PERSON> as he jogged in Mountain View and gunmen in the vehicle sprayed the man with automatic gunfire. It was the first slaying of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> serviceman in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> since Oct. 28, 1987, when gunmen killed two active-duty American servicemen and a retired <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military man outside <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Agency Investigating Wiring Insulation at Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is re-evaluating the use of a wiring insulation found in most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear power plants after discovering damaged electrical circuits at several facilities, according to a published report. <PERSON> Uldis </PERSON> <PERSON> Potapovs </PERSON>, chief of the commission's unit that inspects vendor-supplied plant equipment, said the insulating material known as <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON> appears to damage easily under mechanical stress and even in routine handling by plant maintenance crews, the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> reported in Tuesday's editions. Worn or damaged <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON> has been discovered on electrical wires that connect reactor containment buildings with main-plant control circuits located outside the reactor, <PERSON> Potapovs </PERSON> told the newspaper. He said such damage is a `` significant concern'' because it could cause erroneous equipment readings or failure of equipment, but there has never been a failure serious enough to produce a fire. <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON> can be found on wiring in most of the nation's 104 operating nuclear power plants, <PERSON> Potapovs </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON>, made by E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is a thin, lightweight insulation often used to wrap wiring in high-performance aircraft. It has been cited as a factor in dozens of aircraft fires and is suspected of contributing to dozens more, the Star-Telegram has reported in a series of stories this week. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> has long maintained that its insulation does not crack or break any sooner than other insulation. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, which has banned <LOCATION> Kapton </LOCATION> in its aircraft, says the material deteriorates prematurely, cracks easily and even explodes under certain conditions. But other <LOCATION> Kapton </LOCATION> users, including the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and most commercial aircraft builders, say the insulation is the best on the market for the job. Asked if the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> might call for a ban on <LOCATION> Kapton </LOCATION> in nuclear plants, <PERSON> Potapovs </PERSON> said, `` That certainly would be a possibility.'' But <PERSON> Potapovs </PERSON> added that it seems more likely that the agency will issue a non-binding notice to plant operators recommending that <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON> wires be reinforced with a sleeve or coating and that maintenance crews be instructed in how to best handle the material. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> has already issued one notice dealing with <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON> problems at nuclear power plants, agency records show. The agency reported Feb. 4, 1987, that wires wrapped with <PERSON> Kapton </PERSON> had shorted out because of `` insulation degradation'' on two occasions at separate plants. The wires were in small electric motors that regulated the opening and closing of steam supply valves at the plants.

<HEAD>Cancer Gene Linked To Breast And Lung Cancers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A gene found to be defective in a rare eye cancer has been linked to breast cancer and a common form of lung cancer, researchers say. The gene was the first of a new group of anti-cancer genes that normally protect against cancer but allow cancer to appear when defective, said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Similar anti-cancer genes now have also been linked to colon cancer, another common and lethal form of cancer. The findings that the gene is linked to breast cancer and so-called small-cell lung cancer suggest that it and other anti-cancer genes could play a major role in many types of human cancer, <PERSON> White </PERSON> told genetics students at the <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> on Monday. Identifying those genes and determining how they go wrong does not mean cancer will then be eliminated, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. But the understanding of these genetic abnormalities is crucial to ultimately being able to wipe out cancer, he said. Over the shorter term, he said, understanding the genetics of cancer might allow doctors to diagnose subtypes of common cancers and learn to treat them better. The gene was identified in children with a rare eye cancer known as retinoblastoma. White and <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavenee </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Ludwig </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> were among the scientists who made that initial discovery and learned how the gene worked. Later, those retinoblastoma children were found to develop osteosarcoma, a bone cancer, also as a result of defects in the retinoblastoma gene. More recently, researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, led by <PERSON> Wen-Hwa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, have found that the gene is defective in certain breast cancer cells grown in the laboratory. About the same time, <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute-Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oncology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> reported seeing retinoblastoma gene defects in small-cell lung cancer cells in the laboratory. `` It may well be that the majority of small-cell lung cancers involve a lesion in the retinoblastoma gene as well as several others,'' said <PERSON> White </PERSON>. Retinoblastoma affects perhaps 1,000 Americans annually, but small-cell lung cancer strikes 30,000 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> every year, and breast cancer strikes 130,000. Suddenly, a gene that was important only in a rare disease is now seen to be significant in two of the most important and most devastating human cancers. Meanwhile, <PERSON> White </PERSON> had identified a similar anti-cancer gene in a rare form of inherited colon cancer. He said Monday he has now shown that this anti-cancer gene plays a role in the much more common non-inherited form of colon cancer that is another one of the country's leading cancer killers. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogelstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> also has identified several other genetic defects associated with colon cancer. He estimated that perhaps as many as seven genetic defects must occur for colon cancer to develop. He said he and <PERSON> White </PERSON> have now identified five of those defects. `` You can look at these genetic alterations as the causes of cancer _ just as you can look at bacteria as the causes of infection,'' <PERSON> Vogelstein </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` Except it's more complicated in cancer.''

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> thought a clump of grass got caught in his car's suspension during a camping trip. But he was in for a surprise when he tried to remove the object. `` I touched it and it moved _ and then I moved, too!'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, 33, said Monday. `` I thought it was a snake or something.'' The `` grass'' turned out to be a hedgehog, a small, spiny, porcupine-like mammal. The hedgehog hitched 350 miles underneath the car last weekend before <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> found the prickly little beast curled up in the suspension. `` I thought it was grass,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said he found the hedgehog while cleaning the car and his camping trailer after a seven-hour drive from <LOCATION> Cornwall </LOCATION>, in southwestern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eaton </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Nottingham </LOCATION> in the north. `` I dropped a screwdriver under the car,'' he said. `` The hedgehog really surprised me.'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a sheet-metal worker, dismantled the suspension and removed the frightened animal, taking care not to touch it. He fed the `` ravenous'' little creature cat food and milk. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals later picked up the hedgehog and planned to release it in the countryside, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said. Hedgehogs, which grow to a foot in length including the tail, are covered with sharp spines and often roll into a ball when alarmed. They inhabit the undergrowth in woodlands and along the edges of fields and rarely venture out in daylight.

<HEAD>U.S. Doubts New Soviet Troops Have Entered Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they have come up with no hard evidence that Soviet troops are returning to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, despite a statement Saturday from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Haq </PERSON>. The officials did tell The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, however, that the Soviets would have difficulty meeting the Aug. 15 deadline for withdrawing half the 115,000 troops they had in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Monday, `` We fully expect the Soviets to honor their obligation under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords, to have half their troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Aug. 15th, and we'll continue to watch the situation carefully.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had received assurances from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> `` that they intend to meet their Afghan accord responsibilities.'' `` The basic fact of the matter is there is no evidence of a re-introduction of Soviet troops,'' said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` We doubt they are sending new troops in, but it will be very difficult to get the old ones out,'' another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. The pace of withdrawal stalled over the last two or three months, `` but they have enough time to get out by Aug. 15,'' a third <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials still expressed concerned that some Soviet military leaders found withdrawing under rebel fire difficult and that the Soviet military commander in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> had indicated last week that thousands of new troops would be sent to the embattled country. The commander's remarks were conveyed to <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> team that is monitoring the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> then touched off alarm bells on Saturday with a statement that the Soviets `` decided not only to stop their withdrawal, but they have brought in something like 10,000 troops back from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> was under threat.'' The Soviet military commander in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> may have spoken without the authorization of his superiors in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> or he may have been trying to unsettle the Pakistanis, who channeled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons to the rebels and took in hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees, officials said. `` We may never understand what happened,'' one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. `` Maybe the Soviet general was speaking prematurely or they were trying to get the Pakistanis off balance when he made the statement to <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>.'' In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the chief of the Soviet general staff, Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, rejected the Pakistani charge over the weekend as `` pure slander'' and said the Soviet withdrawal was `` proceeding in full compliance'' with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. The Soviets pledged in the accords signed in May to withdraw half their troops by Aug. 15 and the remainder by Feb. 15. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has fought for 7 -LCB- years alongside the pro-Soviet government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> against the U.S.-backed rebels, some of whom want to establish an Islamic fundamentalist state along the lines of the one in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 Filipino officials announced Tuesday they were indefinitely suspending talks on the status of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases because of `` substantial disagreement'' with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials over compensation. But an American spokeswoman said the break in the talks that began in April was only temporary and that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side expects the negotiations to resume `` shortly.'' `` As has happened several times in the past, there has been a temporary break in the talks,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> in a telephone interview. Mrs. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> is also the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> panel's spokeswoman. `` We do not consider the talks suspended,'' she added. `` Such temporary break occur from time to time particularly when one side needs time to consider a proposal from the other.'' The current talks are held every five years to review terms of the 1947 agreement allowing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to keep <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller installations. The <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> government is pressing for an increase in the $ 180 million it receives annually from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for use of the bases. Before the talks began, Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said the amount of $ 1.2 billion annually would be `` more realistic.'' `` The amount offered -LRB- by the Americans -RRB- was far, far below what we were demanding,'' said <PERSON> Leonides </PERSON> <PERSON> Caday </PERSON>, a member of the Philippine panel. He added that the suspension would last indefinitely, declined to elaborate. `` I do n't see the point in continuing these talks,'' <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Amatong </PERSON>, another Philippine panel member, quoted <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> as telling <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> before the talks broke off. On Monday, <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said that the two panels were nearing agreement but that they may not complete the negotiations by an end-of-the-month deadline. Tuesday's statement said only that `` there was substantial disagreement on the compensation issue, as a result of which the -LRB- Philippine -RRB- panel moved for the suspension of the talks.'' The talks do not directly affect the status of the bases after 1991, when the agreement expires. But a successful review is expected to influence the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> government's decision on whether to extend the agreement beyond 1991. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> says she will honor the current agreement but refuses to say whether she will support an extension after 1991. Under the new Philippine Constitution, any extension must be in the form of a treaty ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where opposition to the bases is currently strong.

 An animator has given in to a conservative media watchdog group and cut a segment from a Mighty Mouse cartoon, but maintains the scene shows the cartoon character sniffing flowers, not snorting cocaine. `` These 3 -LCB- seconds of footage have been taken totally out of context by individuals who seem to be searching for sinister undertones in a cartoon,'' animator <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> said in a statement Monday. `` Some have chosen to interpret the frames as showing a character using drugs,'' continued <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON>, who won an Action for Children's Television award for the Mighty Mouse series on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>. `` Nothing could be further from the truth.'' But the Rev. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON>'s decision a victory for his group. `` This is a de facto admission that indeed Mighty Mouse was snorting cocaine,'' <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> said from his <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, office. `` We have been vindicated by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> itself.'' <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> on Monday also demanded <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON>'s removal as producer of the Saturday morning cartoon and reiterated his call for the firing of <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for children's programming. He asked for a public apology by the network because of the April 23rd episode, titled `` The Littlest Tramp.'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said the cartoon has been rerun twice and will be shown again, but no date was given. The 11-minute episode involves Mighty Mouse's efforts to save <PERSON> Polly </PERSON>, `` a poor but industrious flower seller,'' from a villain who destroys her flowers. Just before vanquishing the villain, Mighty Mouse either sniffs cocaine -LRB- according to <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> -RRB- or inhales the aroma of flowers `` in typical cartoon fashion'' -LRB- according to CBS -RRB-. `` Mighty Mouse was happy after smelling the flowers because it helped him remember the little girl who sold it to him fondly,'' said <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON>, creator of the X-rated `` Fritz the Cat'' animated movies in the 1970s. `` But even if you're right, their accusations become part of the air we breathe. And that's why I cut the scene. I ca n't have children wondering if Mighty Mouse is using cocaine.'' <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> said the work of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> `` is the same thing'' as McCarthyism. `` The principal thrust of this episode is to show the redeeming quality of love and kindness,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> Entertainment President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> LeMaster </PERSON> in a statement supporting <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON>. `` There is nothing in the story line, the dialogue or the behavior of Mighty Mouse that would suggest otherwise.'' <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> last year pressured <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> into scrapping plans for a cartoon based on the `` Garbage Pail Kids'' cards. Other targets of the fundamentalist preacher have been the `` Bloom County'' comic strip, and adult magazines like Penthouse and <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>.

 An oil exploration ship crashed into a barge and overturned, leaving 71 people missing and feared dead in the second major boat accident in southwestern <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province in four days, reports said today. The Sichuan Daily said the Yunhang No. 24, a wooden vessel leased by the <ORGANIZATION> Sichuan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, overturned Monday morning in the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> after colliding with a barge. Twenty-five people were rescued. Most of those on board were workers from a geological prospecting team, the report said. The collision took place in <LOCATION> Yunyang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>, about 280 miles east of the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>. The daily said the boat's engine died after the vessel slammed into a rock. The boat then began drifting backward with the rapid current, crashing into the oncoming barge. The report said the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s longest river, is deep and swift-moving in the area of the accident, making rescue efforts difficult. It said $ 675,000 of oil surveying equipment sank with the ship. The daily also said 77 bodies had been recovered from a passenger boat which sank on Thursday after hitting a rock in the <LOCATION> Min </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a tributary of the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION>. It said 153 people were rescued from the Chuanyun No. 24, while more than 100 remained missing. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> late Monday said 72 deaths had been confirmed, 152 were safe and about 30 were unaccounted for. Estimates on the number missing have varied considerably, partly because of poor communications with the remote mountain area where the accident occurred and partly because of confusion over the number of passengers aboard. The ferry reportedly stopped at several places along its route from <LOCATION> Yibin </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Leshan </LOCATION>, letting people off and taking on new passengers. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been plagued by disasters on its overcrowded transportation system this year. Five fatal train accidents have left 169 dead, while the crash of a Chinese airliner, also in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> in January, killed 108.

 <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamp </PERSON>'s young daughter, <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION>, has been one of the few bright spots in her life since a stroke disabled her two years ago. Today the 4-year-old girl is in the middle of a custody fight between Ms. <PERSON> Shamp </PERSON>, 28, and her estranged husband, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Howdeshell </PERSON>. At issue is whether a handicapped person can adequately care for a child. `` I may not be capable of taking care of her, but, I can care for and love very much and do,'' Ms. <PERSON> Shamp </PERSON> said in a message printed through her computer. The stroke has left Ms. <PERSON> Shamp </PERSON> unable to speak. `` I have overheard Crystal say she wants to stay here. Why should n't she? I am her mother! What about the way I feel or does n't that matter anymore?'' asked Ms. <PERSON> Shamp </PERSON>, who uses a wheelchair and has been living in a nursing home since October 1986. Ms. <PERSON> Shamp </PERSON>, in order to keep <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION>, has asked her parents, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamp </PERSON>, to seek temporary custody of the child, who has been living with them since she was 8 months old. The Shamps, who live in this town of 3,100 residents, filed for temporary custody in May 1987. <PERSON> Howdeshell </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Morenci </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, later filed for permanent custody. The case is in the hands of <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Probate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollex </PERSON>, who listened to five hours of testimony at a hearing last week. He is expected to make a decision the first week of August. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Lublin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Howdeshell </PERSON>'s lawyer, said his client's rights are paramount to those of the grandparents, since the child's mother is unable to care for Crystal. But Mrs. <PERSON> Shamp </PERSON> said in an interview that taking Crystal away from them would be `` just like taking one of our own away.'' `` We have raised that little girl,'' she said. `` The only reason we filed for temporary custody is because <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> asked us to. We all want Crystal to stay here. `` Everybody seems to treat <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> as though she does n't exist, like she was dead. Mentally, there is absolutely nothing wrong with her. It seems that her feelings about Crystal do n't count because she's handicapped,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Shamp </PERSON> met <PERSON> Howdeshell </PERSON> when her family lived in <LOCATION> Morenci </LOCATION> in the late 1970s. But shortly after they were married in 1979, their relationship soured. After they separated several years ago, <PERSON> Howdeshell </PERSON> gained custody of their son, <PERSON> Shane </PERSON>, now 7. Ms. <PERSON> Shamp </PERSON> had custody of Crystal and went home to live with her parents, who had moved to this village 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Shamp </PERSON> was granted a divorce in 1986. Ms. <PERSON> Shamp </PERSON> later moved to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, leaving Crystal with her parents while she tried to put together her life. She suffered the stroke Sept. 10, 1986. Since then, Ms. <PERSON> Shamp </PERSON> has lived in the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. She sees Crystal on the weekends at her parent's house. At the hearing, <PERSON> Howdeshell </PERSON> said he believed his daughter would be `` better off in a healthier atmosphere with her brother. `` I love my daughter and believe she should be with us,'' he said. The <PERSON> Shamps </PERSON> said they can provide a loving home for Crystal. `` She's all that <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> has. <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> looks forward to seeing her daughter. She looks forward to coming home on the weekends ... to having Crystal crawl up on her lap and hug her. If you take this away, it may be taking the only thing that <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> has that is worth fighting for,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Shamp </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Government Lifts Import Ban On Beef</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By M.H. AHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government sought to cool trade tensions today by lifting a 3-year-old ban on imported beef, but limited this year's shipments to 14,500 tons. Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kun-hwan </PERSON>, who made the announcement, did not say how much beef will be imported after this year, but indicated imports will be limited in order to protect the local beef industry. Officials said the government will maintain an import quota system, which has been opposed by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The end to the import ban was designed to avoid trade friction with foreign countries while at the same time alleviating domestic beef shortages, <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been pressing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to drop the ban on beef and many other imports to help correct <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s $ 10 billion trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. There was no immediate reaction from local farmers who have strongly opposed imports of beef unless the government guaranteed a definite price support system before lifting the import ban. Many Korean farmers went bankrupt due to an excessive import of foreign beef cattle before the last ban was imposed in 1985. Farmers have staged demonstrations to demand retention of the import ban. Imported beef will be stockpiled in case the government needs to stabilize prices if domestic sales prices exceed designated levels, <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> has said previously that this year's proposed quota will include 3,000 tons of high-quality American beef for tourist hotels. Officials said that beef could start arriving next month.

 A mild earthquake jarred the central Coast Ranges area, apparently causing a small landslide near <LOCATION> Hollister </LOCATION>. No damage or injuries were reported. The quake struck at 8:27 p.m. Monday and measured 4.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, said the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. Its was centered 10 miles north of <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and 40 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>, said seismologist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhrhammer </PERSON>. State forestry workers discovered the landslide 18 miles outside <LOCATION> Hollister </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> shortly after the earthquake, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortulgaliza </PERSON>. `` I would have to think it -LRB- the earthquake -RRB- was what caused it,'' she said. The rocks blocked a road until they were removed. <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Liskey </PERSON>, a dispatcher with the <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department in <LOCATION> Salinas </LOCATION>, said the quake was felt by people working in the basement of the county courthouse `` It was just a little one,'' she said. The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. An earthquake with a magnitude of 4.0 can cause moderate damage.

 Negotiations to end the 20-week-old scriptwriters strike continued past midnight Monday's deadline set by a federal mediator. At the opening of contract talks Monday afternoon, representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> were told they had nine hours to end their labor dispute that has crippled the industry. `` At 12 midnight, we're going to be through,'' said <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, district director for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm going to conclude the negotiations at midnight.'' But the talks continued after midnight. Wood, one of two mediators taking part in Monday's talks, did not say what would happen if the two sides were unable to reach a settlement by that time. He did say, however, the deadline was imposed `` to keep these people thinking about solutions'' and push them toward a settlement. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> also had said the writers and producers were making progress in the marathon contract talks, which were ordered by mediator <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> last week and began Saturday. `` Both sides are working hard,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. Because of a news blackout ordered by <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, neither the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> nor the producers alliance could comment on the negotiations. <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> sources familiar with the negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity, said earlier Monday that the producers alliance so far has made few concessions in weekend bargaining sessions, the first two of which lasted 13 hours each. At issue in the strike, which began March 7, are payments for one-hour television programs rebroadcast domestically and all television shows rebroadcast overseas. On June 22, the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> roundly rejected the producers' last contract offer, which the producers alliance has repeatedly described as `` final.'' The strike has resulted in a delay of the fall television season and sweeping layoffs throughout the entertainment industry. The <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> is proceeding with pickets called for Wednesday morning at the offices of television producer <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Spelling </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> studios.

 Police plan to demonstrate at a performance next month by <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> because the country singer participated in a fund-raiser for <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peltier </PERSON>, an American Indian convicted of killing two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> today marks the 35th anniversary of his revolutionary fight to power, facing a battle against inefficiency that has dogged the economic performance of his communist state. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> traditionally gives his most important speech of the year on the anniversary of his failed effort to take the <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON> garrison here on July 26, 1953. He came to power less than six years later, on Jan. 1, 1959. The government has a 2-year-old `` rectification campaign'' to eradicate employee absenteeism, low productivity and other signs of inefficiency in the island nation's economy. But domestic commercial production fell by 3.2 percent last year, while <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s foreign debt grew by $ 671.8 million to $ 5.6 billion. The economy is heavily dependent on the sugar industry, which has suffered poor harvests for three consecutive years because of severe drought. In marked contrast to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` perestroika,'' or restructuring that involves economic liberalization, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has moved away from economic incentives and loosening state economic controls to focus on moral persuasion in a bid to increase productivity `` I do n't see why one thing should be linked with the other,'' <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, editor of the Cuban <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> monthly magazine <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Militante </ORGANIZATION>, told foreign correspondents Monday when asked about the apparent differences between Cuban and Soviet policy. `` The problems are our problems ... stemming from our own situation,'' he said. <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said that political work was neglected in favor of economic incentives in the decade preceding the rectification campaign. The government implemented, then abandoned, such experiments as a restricted free market for agricultural goods. `` The formation of the New Man was lost a little,'' <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said. Although a possible <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> agreement with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> that could lead to the withdrawal of nearly 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has drawn heavy international attention, officials in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> have been reluctant to discuss the issue and there is little mention of ongoing talks in the domestic news media. Cuban newspapers instead have focused almost entirely on the anniversary celebration, including extensive historical recollections of the failed battle and the startlingly young faces of <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and his companions 35 years ago. The attack <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> led on the <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON> military barracks in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s second city after <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, failed. But the brutality with which it was suppressed by the regime of <PERSON> Fulgencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Batista </PERSON> triggered popular support for <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s later revolutionary insurrection. Celebration plans called for Pioneer Youth groups to recreate each step of the <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON> attack. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has been in the <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> area since last week to inaugurate public works projects, including the nation's second oil refinery, built with Soviet help, and a new hotel held up as an example of what can be done to expand the tourist industry and attract badly needed foreign exchange. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> timed the attack on <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON>, now a museum and elementary school, to coincide with the traditional Carnival celebration to take government forces by surprise. Carnival still is celebrated these days simultaneously with the <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON> anniversary.

 The Miss Teen USA pageant crowned a petite redhead who wants to help child victims of drug or alcohol abuse, but disqualified a contestant and declined to say why. The winner of Monday night's nationally televised pageant was 16-year-old <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hillsboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> `` It's wonderful,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Newberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> student. `` It's a feeling you ca n't explain.

No formal announcement of the disqualification of <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 16-year-old <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toro </ORGANIZATION>, was made until reporters questioned the change in the number of contestants. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, a pageant spokesman, said in a brief statement that Miss <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> broke a pageant rule. She was allowed to participate in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> broadcast but was dropped from eligibility. Later, a newspaper reporter who persisted in attempting to determine why <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> was declared ineligible was escorted from the pageant site by security guards and told not to return. Pageant officials said the matter of eligibility rested between the pageant and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, and declined to elaborate, citing her age. TV personality <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and actress <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Scoggins </PERSON> were hosts of the pageant, whose contestants ranged from ages 15-18. Miss <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> succeeds <PERSON> Kristi </PERSON> <PERSON> Addis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Holcolm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and wins $ 150,000 in cash and prizes, including a Jeep, jewelry, a mink coat and mink jacket, exercise equipment and an electronic keyboard.

 Guards quelled an uprising at the overcrowded 177-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> in less than an hour, but officials were unsure today what sparked the knifings and gunshots that left 12 people injured. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, about 30 inmates, some with metal pipes and clubs, brawled in an exercise yard at a maximum-security prison, officials said. Two sustained minor injuries in Monday's disturbance Authorities here were trying to determine whether a corrections officer shot a fellow guard during Monday afternoon's riot. The injured officer was one of four guards still hospitalized today after order was restored at the downtown maximum-security prison. In all, eight guards, three inmates and a prison psychologist suffered broken bones, knife wounds or gunshot wounds in the melee, which was confined to the recreation yard and crisis clinic, officials said. `` I think the warden acted properly. I think ... he took action as soon has he felt there was something unusual happening,'' Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said in defense of prison warden <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said that after <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> noticed only a few inmates turned up for breakfast and lunch, he bolstered the 116-guard force by transferring some officers from administrative posts to the yard. The disturbance began in a yard about 12:45 p.m., spread to the clinic where the psychologist was conducting a session with inmates, and erupted again in another section of the yard, said a state police spokesman, Cpl. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON>. He said a minor fire also was set in the clinic. `` There were assaults on guards by groups of inmates,'' <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> did n't know if the disturbances were coordinated. He said the penitentiary tactical force suited up in riot helmets and batons to quell the uprisings. The prison was locked down by early afternoon and remained so today, officials said. Two homemade knives and two baseball bats were recovered. Throughout the day and evening, city police officers remained stationed near the 1811 prison, the nation's second-oldest, and helicopters circled. One inmate was in critical condition after surgery for gunshot wounds to the head and neck, while another was in fair condition with a gunshot wound to the head, said <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON>. One guard was listed as serious at <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> and one was in surgery there early today. Two other guards were listed as stable at Mercy Medical Center. Four guards and the pyschologist were not hospitalized. Spokesmen for two of the three unions representing the guards blasted corrections officials for deteriorating conditions at the prison, which housed 1,270 inmates on Monday though it's supposed to hold 700 to 800. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, officials said the brawl at the Cedar Junction prison at <LOCATION> Walpole </LOCATION> was divided along racial lines and may have resulted from the stabbing of a black prisoner by three whites Sunday night. The victim was hospitalized in stable condition with stab wounds to the chest. On Monday, 60 to 70 inmates climbed through the windows of an industrial workshop to try to join the brawl, but were stopped when a tower guard fired warning shots into the air, said <PERSON> Deodato </PERSON> <PERSON> Arruda </PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Arruda </PERSON> said the fighting lasted less than 15 minutes. Two inmates suffered cuts requiring `` two or three stitches'' at the prison infirmary. No guards were injured, he said.

<HEAD>Arafat Aide: Reagan Representative Asked Delay In Hostages'
Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A representative of then-candidate <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 to try to delay <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s release of the American hostages until after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election, a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> offical said. The White House quickly denied the allegation made to <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> magazine by an aide to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Also in the magazine's September issue, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said a close adviser to then-President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> sought the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s help in speeding the release. In the wake of the 1973 war between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its Arab neighbors, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed not to have contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> because the organization refuses to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence. Minutes after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981, the 52 Americans held 444 days at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> were freed. In the interview, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he was instrumental in helping thousands of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> escape from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1976 and 1977, and in winning release of some of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in 1980. `` We released the first hostages from the embassy, the first 13 embassy personnel,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. `` They were released according to my personal efforts.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he undertook the mission at the request of <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` There was a special and permanent contact between me and President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. `` I have written documents from President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> himself.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said that although he had a letter of thanks from former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> for his help in 1976 and 1977, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government never acknowledged his alleged role in the 1980 hostage release. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s chief adviser, <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, said in the interview that a member of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1980 campaign staff asked the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to help stall the release. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s supporters in 1980 made much of <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s failure to obtain the release of the hostages. `` We were told that if the hostages were held, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would be given recognition ... and the White House door would be open for us,'' said <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>. `` It is not true,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Roman Popadiuk countered Monday in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> declined to elaborate. <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said he met in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with one of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` closest friends'' during the 1980 presidential race. He identified the supporter as a major financial contributor to the campaign but did not name the individual. <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> associate `` asked that I contact the chairman and make the request.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was not available for comment Monday, but a spokeswoman said he had been asked previously about reports that a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> supporter had attempted to delay the hostages' release. `` We have reports similar ... but I never sought or received any confirmation of the allegations,'' <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> as saying. Neither <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> was paid for the interviews, which were conducted in April and May, said magazine spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Paige </PERSON>. He said he did not know if <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was present when <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> made the allegation that a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ally had sought the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s help in delaying the hostages' release. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> made no comment on the allegation in the printed interview.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed Iraqi troops pushed further into Iranian territory today as a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> team arrived in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to discuss a truce between the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> enemies. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, after a series of sweeping attacks during the weekend, denied the claim and said it was moving its forces out of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and would take its dispute to the bargaining table. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION>, an Iraqi-backed forced opposed to <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, claimed its forces had taken two Iranian towns and had marched 95 miles into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, diplomats for both countries were preparing to meet Wednesday with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to discuss an end to the 8-year-old gulf war. A separate team of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> advisers arrived in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> today to begin working on the technical aspects of a truce. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vadset </PERSON>, the team leader, said he will explore ways to implement and maintain a cease-fire, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said the seven officials would remain in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for three days, then fly to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. Another team of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> experts is already in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to determine the status of prisoners of war. The peace moves were made possible after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced July 18 that it accepted a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a cease-fire. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepted the resolution shortly after it was adopted in July 1987. But since then, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has sought to take as many Iranian prisoners as possible, saying it captured more than 8,000 in three days in attacks that began Friday, apparently as a bargaining chip during peace talks. A communique carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops would `` be withdrawn in line with our declared policy that we have no territorial ambitions in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' Announcers on state-run Iraqi television said troops would pull back today from Qasr-e <PERSON> Shirin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sumar </PERSON> and Sar-e Pol-e Zahab, all on the central war front. A military spokesman said on <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> radio today that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces had pulled out of Gilan-e Gharb in the morning and would soon withdraw from the other towns. But the Iranian news agency said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops thrust further into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> early today and tried to take the town of <LOCATION> Karand </LOCATION>, 35 miles from the border, and the nearby town of <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION>. It said Iranian fighters launched a counter-offensive and pushed the Iraqis out of <ORGANIZATION> Karand </ORGANIZATION>, killing or wounding hundreds, with the help of residents. It said the Iraqis still held <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION> but Iranian forces were battling to free the town in `` heavy fighting.'' The deputy speaker of the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON>, announced the legislature was to be `` temporarily closed so that the deputies may go to the war fronts,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, Information Minister <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON> called the Iranian claims `` lies and fabrications'' and re-asserted that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> planned to complete its pullout on the central front today. A spokesman in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, an alliance of anti-Khomeini exile groups, claimed it took <ORGANIZATION> Karand </ORGANIZATION>. Large numbers of Iranian troops in the area defected to the opposition army, bringing their weapons and equipment, said the spokesman, <PERSON> Alireza </PERSON> <PERSON> Jafarzadeh </PERSON>. He said `` several divisions'' of the army were 95 miles inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and heading toward the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION>. The conflicting claims could not be independently confirmed. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that he will meet separately with Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and his Iraqi counterpart <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is not yet prepared to have direct talks with its enemy, but the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief said he may suggest direct meetings later. `` We have certainly contemplated direct talks,'' he said. He predicted a truce could be implemented within 10 days. The resolution provides for a cease-fire, withdrawal to recognized borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an investigation of which side started the war. In a related development, members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> began private consultations Monday on an Iranian complaint that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons in the weekend offensive. The use of chemical weapons violates the 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Monday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is prepared now to talk to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> about American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. An administration official said the potential end of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war might signal a thaw in U.S.-Iran relations.

<HEAD>Feds Indict `Marco Polo' of Drug Smuggling, 21 Others in Asian
Marijuana Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Briton dubbed the `` <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Polo </PERSON> of drug trafficking'' was arrested on a federal indictment charging 22 people with running a worldwide hashish and marijuana smuggling ring based in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, authorities said. The indictment accuses all 22 defendants of racketeering, including ringleader <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, interim <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> told a news conference Monday. Marks, 42, was arrested Monday in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, with his wife, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON>, and fellow Briton <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenion </PERSON>. Marks was previously acquitted of drug charges in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> after falsely claiming he worked for MI5, the British counterintelligence agency, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said. Marks, an <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate and a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> resident, operated all over the world, authorities said. `` He was the <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Polo </PERSON> of drug trafficking,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office. The ring led by Marks for 17 years shipped marijuana from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and hashish from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, authorities said. It operated in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries. `` They shipped in ton quantities, thousands of tons,'' said <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>. The ring had its own ship and amassed $ 30 million in property that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government now wants confiscated, he said. The traffickers laundered money through banks and corporations around the world, officials said. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said he expected <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to quickly extradite the <ORGANIZATION> Markses </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kenion </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Reaves </PERSON>, who was arrested several weeks ago in that country. More arrests were expected, including some in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said. Several of the people indicted were Marks' relatives. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, a British citizen arrested Monday in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, Marks' brother-in-law, authorities said `` Marks made a family enterprise out of it, using his wife, his brother-in-law and sister-in-law,'' said Cash. Marks was the subject of `` The Life and High Times of <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>,'' a British book in which he detailed his drug career in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

 Ten elementary school pupils from one of the city's poorest, roughest neighborhoods were leaving for a three-country tour of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> after studying French and raising $ 30,000 for the trip. The pupils at <ORGANIZATION> Suder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> have worked since October, studying African culture after school and getting shots, passports and visas in preparation for their departure this afternoon, Principal <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Daigre </PERSON> said Monday. The children, aged 11 to 14, will make a one-day stopover in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. Then it's on to <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Abidjan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Lome </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION>. They are scheduled to return to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Aug. 9. In preparing for their trip, the youngsters have heard African speakers and visited the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> branch at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> here, Mrs. <PERSON> Daigre </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` We taught them how to set long-range goals,'' and how to meet short-term goals along the way, she said. `` I think we have made them much more sophisticated about meeting people ... how to carry themselves.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Daigre </PERSON>, one of five adults going on the trip, helped organize it. She said setting up travel to any country would be instructive for the students, but that for students from an all-black school it would be particularly beneficial to visit countries dominated and run by blacks. `` I have traveled extensively, and nothing hit me as hard as when I went to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said the principal, who also is black. `` There is a kinship that you feel, there is an openness that you feel. `` I felt as though I went home, I really did,'' she said. <PERSON> Yo-seanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Baines </PERSON>, 13, who will be an eighth-grader at <LOCATION> Suder </LOCATION> this fall, said she's anxious to meet people in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and see `` how they dress and the food they eat.'' She also wants to see what houses and clothes look like in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Yo-seanda's mother, <PERSON> Vernya </PERSON> <PERSON> Baines </PERSON>, said she thinks the trip will be a `` beautiful experience'' for her daughter, who has never been on an airplane or traveled out of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` We're poor, but I think it'll give them a chance to see people that are poorer than we are,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Baines </PERSON> said. `` Maybe she'll appreciate some of the things she maybe takes for granted. More than $ 30,000 was raised for the trip from churches, community groups and fund-raising events such as candy sales, said Mrs. <PERSON> Daigre </PERSON>, who is paying her own way. The cost for each child is $ 2,700. School officials told the students that some <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> cities would look much like <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities, and that the old stereotype of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a land of villages and huts may not apply, Mrs. <PERSON> Daigre </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Abidjan </LOCATION> is referred to as the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` When you go downtown, you think you are in a small, metropolitan city. `` The lesson from that is travel and find out for yourself.''

 Two states, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, ended fiscal year 1988 in the red while <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> expect deficits in 1989, according to a national survey. The study, released Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislatures </ORGANIZATION>, said the total budget balance of the 50 states on June 30, the end of fiscal year 1988, was $ 6.1 billion. That equaled 2.6 percent of overall general-fund state spending in fiscal 1988 _ about half the minimum surplus economists recommend. `` The margin of safety for many states is not much,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>, fiscal affairs director for the lawmakers' group. `` But it's amazing, I think, that more states did n't have problems. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> showed an 18.9 percent deficit for 1988 and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> a 3.4 percent deficit. In last year's survey, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> also were the only states with deficits. The new survey also found <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> projected a 10.2 percent deficit in 1989 and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> a 3.5 percent deficit for that year. In addition, it found that 43 states estimated they had surpluses for fiscal 1988. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> led with a 17.7 percent budget surplus this year, followed by <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> at 15.7 percent, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> at 15.5 percent, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> at 15.3 percent, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> at 14.8 percent, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> at 13.1 percent and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> at 10.1 percent. Those were the only states with double-digit percentage surpluses this year, according to the survey of 49 states. Complete information from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> did not come in time to make the survey. Overall, the preliminary survey indicated that a strong national economy helped 20 states become better off in 1988 than in 1987, while 18 states held their own and 10 states declined. `` In many states, there has been an improvement over the past few years,'' <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said at the meeting of 1,500 of the nation's state legislators, who are in town through Friday for their annual conference <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said many of the fiscal problems have been caused by budgeting uncertainty because of unpredictable federal policies. States like <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are `` traveling in unchartered waters'' because of several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law and policy changes, he said. Those include tax reform, federal mandates for new state programs that lack the necessary funding, and reduction of federal funding in areas such as housing, welfare, education and transportation. `` People were really working in the dark,'' <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said. `` States are gradually taking on more and more roles. Where the federal government has cut back, the states have taken up the slack.'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON>, president of the national legislatures group, agreed. `` Uncertainties in budgeting are growing and states must continue to be cautious in their budget and revenue decisions,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s most powerful leaders met today to discuss a successor to Ne Win as chairman of the country's ruling <ORGANIZATION> socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, sources said. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gathered to choose successors to Ne Win and party Vice Chairman <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu </PERSON>, the country's two most powerful figures, the sources said on condition of anonymity. The 77-year-old Ne Win, who came to power in a 1962 military coup, announced abruptly Saturday that he was resigning. He cited his age and violent anti-government rioting in March and June as key factors in his decision. The Central Committee, elected in 1985, includes about 270 members and normally abides by decisions made by the party's most powerful body _ the 15-member Central Executive Committee. The most senior member of the executive committee, party General Secretary <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON>, is considered Ne Win's likely successor. No details of the meeting were available. It comes one day after a special party congress concluded its meetings on sweeping reform proposals. The three-day congress session ended Monday with a vaguely worded announcement, possibly reflecting splits within the party over the dramatic events of recent days. The official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said delegates `` firmly suggested'' against a voter referendum on whether <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s 26 years of one-party rule should be replaced by a multi-party system. The rejection of Ne Win's recommendation for the referendum was the first known time the party had not rubber-stamped his proposals. Some liberalization of the economy last year has failed to stop <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s downward spiral. Inflation is soaring, government stores are virtually empty and the country is saddled with a foreign debt of about $ 4 billion.

<HEAD>Delegation Leaves For Historic Visit To Moscow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> delegation including two Soviet-born Jews headed today for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the first such official trip in 21 years. The five Israelis will kick off their visit by attending Sabbath prayers in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> synagogue, where they hope to have a chance to meet informally with Soviet Jews, said Soviet-born diplomat <PERSON> Meron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who heads the group. In addition to <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, 41, who came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> at the age of 10, the delegation includes <PERSON> Yaakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Kedmi </PERSON>, a former Soviet dissident named <PERSON> Yasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazakov </PERSON> who came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1960s. `` We are both very moved,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. `` When we left there, we were young. I do n't think either of us ever thought we could return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ certainly not as official representatives of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The delegates left for <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, where they are to pick up two-month visas and then travel to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Thursday. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> severed ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1967 after the Six Day War to protest <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the territory captured from three Arab countries. The two countries still have no official diplomatic relations, but links between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> have recently improved. In the summer of 1986, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and Soviet delegates met in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, for the first official session since 1967. Last summer, a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation arrived in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> on two-month visas that since have been extended. Before leaving from <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> told reporters the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> delegates would visit a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> synagogue Friday evening for Sabbath prayers. The delegates, most of whom speak Russian, will work out of an office in the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, which represents Israeli interests in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. One of their first jobs will be to inspect the old <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> building, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. The other delegates are <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Megido </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gershon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Balsar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorev </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Hasia </PERSON>, also is accompanying the team.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> sent a postcard from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> the day before the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner he is accused of hijacking departed from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, according to evidence introduced today. The postcard, introduced by prosecutors during <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s trial on air piracy and murder charges, was dated June 13, 1985, and had been sent to the brother of <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s West German girlfriend. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight 847 was hijacked on June 14, 1985, and diverted to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, after it had departed <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was fatally shot and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. The postcard was read by Chief Judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> at the start of the fourth week of <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s trial in a courtroom on a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> prison compound on charges of hijacking, murder and possession of explosives. The postcard, written in German, is addressed to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, brother of <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s former West German girlfriend, <PERSON> Birgit </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for two years until November 1984. The postcard carries a stamp June 13, 1985, and reads: `` I send you this card after seven months because you are my friend and brother. Take care of my daughter <PERSON> Lydia </PERSON>. Your brother <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>.'' In the text, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> purportedly wrote: `` Today is my birthday and I am now in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> said the postcard was sent from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is being tried by a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> juvenile court, which is attempting to determine his age at the time the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking began. Depending on the court's decision on the age issue, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> could receive a maximum prison sentence of 15 years as a young adult, or life imprisonment as an adult if found guilty as charged. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, allegedly sent another postcard dated June 11, 1985, to his girlfriend in the southern West German town of <LOCATION> Saarlouise </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> said the stamp on the second postcard had been torn off and it was not clear if the card had been sent from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The card says, `` To my <PERSON> Lydia </PERSON>, greetings from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>.'' The postcards were introduced as evidence during testimony by <PERSON> Lydia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, mother of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <PERSON> Birgit </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, 48, testified that <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> had told the family he was born on June 13, 1964, which would have made him 21 when the hijacking took place. Court records show <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was born on June 13, 1964, but <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has said the year of his birth on official records was altered by his father, making him `` one or two years older,'' to gain more social support payments for his family in warn-torn <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Also scheduled to testify was the former wife of <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s older brother, 29-year-old <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. A <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> court in April convicted <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> of masterminding the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> kidnappings of two West Germans in an attempt to gain the release of his brother. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was sentenced to 13 years in prison. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport on Jan. 13, 1987, after customs officials discovered bottles of liquid explosives in his luggage. Shortly after his arrest, two West Germans, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, were kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport on Jan. 26, 1987, after returning from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and charged with the abductions. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> was released by his captors in September, but <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> remains a hostage.

<HEAD>Midnight Deadline Passes, Talks Continue In Writer's Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Both sides refused to speculate on how negotiations were going today in the 20-week-old writers strike after a federal mediator stopped the clock on his own deadline, keeping representatives at the bargaining table. `` The talks continue and the mediator is still present,'' <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said early today. `` The mediator stopped the clock.'' Talks were supposed to end at midnight. There was no comment on whether the two sides were nearing agreement, as a news blackout was imposed by <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, the federal mediator who ordered both sides to resume negotiations last week. `` There's just no way to predict'' the outcome, Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. At the opening of contract talks Monday afternoon, representatives of both the guild and the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> were told they had nine hours to end their dispute. `` At 12 midnight, we're going to be through,'' said <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, district director for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, who imposed the deadline. `` I'm going to conclude the negotiations at midnight.'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> also said at time that the writers and producers were making progress in the talks. `` Both sides are working hard,'' he said. Guild sources familiar with the negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the producers had made few concessions in bargaining sessions Saturday and Sunday, which lasted 13 hours each. However, there were reports on the guild's computer bulletin board Monday that <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> had threatened the producers with fines for refusing to bargain at the commencement of talks Saturday. The threat was confirmed by an independent guild source familiar with the negotiations, who spoke anonymously. Adding pressure on the producers to settle was the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union, which said its Hollywood members may strike next week. A Teamsters strike could halt almost all film production in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> studios. `` I certainly hope we do n't strike,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, secretary treasurer of Teamsters Local 399. `` But there's always that possibility when a contract expires.'' The Teamsters contract with the producers expires Sunday at midnight. At issue in the writers' strike, which began March 7, are payments for one-hour television programs rebroadcast domestically and all television shows rebroadcast overseas. The strike has delayed the fall television season and has led to sweeping layoffs throughout the entertainment industry.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> told <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in a surprise letter today that it was willing to talk about entering the Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, but insisted again on discussing its demand to co-host the Games, officials said. The North had said previously it would boycott the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Games unless it was made a co-host <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> have said some events could be held in the <PERSON> North </PERSON>, but that the Games are awarded to a single host city _ in this case <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> _ and not to countries. Aides to <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chae-sun </PERSON>, speaker of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said today's letter was from <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyong </PERSON> <PERSON> Sop </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. It was received at the border truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, they added. As made public by the aides, the letter said, `` We are willing to discuss the issue of our participation in the Olympics as demanded by your side.'' The letter came as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was considering its response to an earlier North Korean letter proposing parliamentary talks on a non-aggression pact between the two rivals, split since 1945 into the communist North and capitalist South. They fought a bloody war in 1950-53. The new North Korean letter said, `` We propose with courtesy that the scheduled North-South joint parliamentary conference be held within August at the latest before the opening of the Olympics and discuss as an urgent agenda such issues as your request for our participation in the Olympics and our proposal for its co-hosting.'' The South Korean government had no immediate comment. The <ORGANIZATION> IOC </ORGANIZATION> has said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> could stage archery, table tennis, women's volleyball, preliminary soccer games and a cycling road race. The North has insisted on more, including its own set of opening and closing ceremonies in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> and a share of television revenue. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympic officials have said the offer to the North would be kept open until the last possible moment in hopes of promoting North-South reconciliation. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s political leaders had been working to solve differences among themselves before sending a unified response on Monday next week to the North's earlier letter. South Korean government officials have been reluctant to agree to immediate full-scale parliamentary talks, saying preliminary negotiations are needed for such conferences. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is one of only six countries that have not accepted invitations to the Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The others are <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Seychelles </LOCATION>. A record 12,000 athletes from 161 nations are expected to compete in the Games. The 161 include North Korean allies <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which have no diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 An appeals court has overturned the conviction of a public relations man accused of collaborating with the late Queens Borough President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Manes </PERSON> in soliciting a bribe for the awarding of a cable television franchise. The Appellate Division of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday overturned the indictment, conviction and sentence of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, a political associate of <LOCATION> Manes </LOCATION> and one-time aide to former Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 40, was convicted Aug. 7, 1987, of collaborating with <PERSON> Manes </PERSON> in soliciting a $ 250,000 bribe from <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Orth-O-Vision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in 1981, when the company was competing for a cable television franchise in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. The prosecution said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> refused to pay. His company did not win the franchise. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, who had worked on Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s 1982 campaign, was sentenced to one to three years in prison. In its ruling Monday, the four-judge appeals panel said it `` agreed with the defendant's contention that the evidence adduced was legally insufficient to support his conviction.'' <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was `` grateful and relieved'' and determined to `` get on with his life.'' <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was free without bail pending the appeal, living in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> and working as a sales consultant. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s was one of three trials that stemmed from investigations into the awarding of cable franchises in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. In another of the cases, real-estate developer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, the husband of former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice-presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, was acquitted last October of working with <PERSON> Manes </PERSON> to extort a bribe for the awarding of a cable franchise. In the third case, former <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> Administrative Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was convicted in July 1987 of perjury and criminal contempt. He was sentenced to one year in jail but has remained free on bail while an appeal is being prepared. <PERSON> Manes </PERSON> fatally stabbed himself in the heart in March 1986 as word of the indictments leaked out.

 A special administrative council dominated by Gurkhas will be set up in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> state as part of a plan to end a separatist war by Gurkha militants, the government says. The council will administer 1,080 square miles in the tea-growing Darjeeling district of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>. More than 1.4 million Gurkhas, who are Indians of Nepalese descent, live in the <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Narendra </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Home Ministry, said the decision was made at a meeting between Home Minister <PERSON> Buta </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> Chief Minister <PERSON> Jyoti </PERSON> <PERSON> Basu </PERSON> and Gurkha leader <PERSON> Subhas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghising </PERSON>. The three met at <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s residence in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. The Home Ministry is responsible for Indian internal security. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Darjeeling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gurkha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> will be set up as soon as practicable,'' <PERSON> Narendra </PERSON> said. He estimated it would take about three months. `` A final agreement will be signed at <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION> very soon,'' he added. <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION> is the capital of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> state. Militant Gurkhas launched an campaign for a separate state within the Indian union in May 1986, claiming their cultural and social identity was being swamped by migrants from other parts of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>. More than 300 people have been killed in attacks by the militants. Most of the deaths have occurred in the Darjeeling district, known for its tea and breath-taking views of the <LOCATION> Himalaya </LOCATION> mountains. The separatist campaign was suspended at the end of June after Ghising held discussions with <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Basu </PERSON>, where the creation of the hill council was agreed to in principle. A sticking point, the inclusion of the word `` Gurkha'' in its title, apparently was resolved at Monday's meeting. Sunday, a weekly news magazine, reported earlier that the council would be responsible for land allotment, tourism, public works, health and education. It will be made up of 42 members, with 30 to be elected and the rest named by local legislators, the magazine said. <PERSON> Narendra </PERSON> said the council would be set up after the proposal received the sanction of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> legislature and plans for the elections were worked out. An estimated six million Gurkhas reside in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>.

The offer is part of a package being pursued by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> aides that includes a pledge to promote national reconciliation in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> if he is n't charged with wrongdoing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. `` If there is no indictment, he will support the government of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' said Col. <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON> at <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> home in exile. `` There will be a national reconciliation.'' Representatives of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> are talking with <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> officials, including Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON> and Philippine Ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Peleaz </PERSON>, trying to work out the $ 5 billion deal, according to <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, political science professor. <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON>, who has been in direct contact with the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> camp in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, and with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has agreed to stay out of Filipino politics, stay out of the capital <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and support Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> if he is allowed to return. But the ousted ruler, accused of siphoning billions of dollars from the national treasury during his tenure as president, has asked that his son <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> be allowed to run for political office, perhaps for governor of the family's home province of <ORGANIZATION> Ilocos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> said. Asked about the $ 5 billion offer, <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> said, `` You have long ears. ... I'm not sure whether I can talk about it or not. I'd rather you did n't ask me. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' spokesman in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, Gemmo <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>, however, quoted <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> as saying the report about a $ 5 billion offer `` is totally absurd.'' `` The president -LRB- <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> -RRB- told me negotiations are going on, but they do not involve any money,'' <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said he was not privy to information on who was particating in the negotiations. Estimates of the amount of money allegedly diverted from the Philippine treasury by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates range from $ 1 billion to $ 10 billion. The $ 5 billion offer was so high it reportedly caught Philippine officials by surprise and raised suspicions as to how much money he may have put away. `` That's why the negotiations have n't been easy,'' <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> said. `` Everyone -LRB- in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> -RRB- is saying, ` If he's got $ 5 billion, maybe he's got $ 40 billion.'' In the two years since the revolution that led to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' flight to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has repeatedly said he could n't return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. But recently she has softened that position, saying <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> could return if he agreed to stand trial. Federal officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> have recommended that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> be indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges stemming from his alleged use of <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government funds to buy art and real estate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> while concealing their ownership. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quintin </PERSON> <PERSON> Doromal </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Good Government, said he was unaware of the offer. The commission is responsible for tracking down and recovering money <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> allegedly stole during his 20 years in office. `` I do n't think the commission knows anything about it,'' <PERSON> Doromal </PERSON> said. `` If there is such a thing, we would know something about it but it's zero, no information along that line.''

<HEAD>PTL Will Auction Gifts That Were Stored in Vault</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An appraiser will begin setting prices today on gifts by <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> contributors _ ranging from old coins to fur coats _ that were stashed in a vault at <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>. PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said the items, which supporters donated over a 10-year period, will be auctioned early next month to raise money for the ailing television ministry. `` I do n't know of a more critical time to use these gifts than right now as we try to undergo the reorganization,'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> told a reporter Monday, as he examined a bag of coins taken from a 15-by-16-foot vault at the World Outreach Center. Although the vault looked like any other storage closet, valuable coins and dollars were found in some file cabinets and stamps were organized in books or piled in envelopes. Furs were strewn across some cartons. The ministry has n't determined the value of the items, but <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s administrative assistant, <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalnaker </PERSON>, said he was told one stamp book was worth $ 28,000 to $ 30,000. `` We ca n't answer the value of what we have until the appraisal's made, but some of these dollars in there are worth $ 100 or more,'' he said. Many of the furs that had been in the vault were sold at earlier auctions, he said. `` The partners send it in just to help support the ministry,'' said <PERSON> Delores </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, supervisor of cash management, as she reached for gold bank notes and a bag of coins, some of them dating to 1853. Besides auctioning the valuables, ministry officials expect to auction cars, trucks, a train, heavy equipment, some motor homes and a boat that had been used at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>.

 A woman walking to her car in the parking lot of a bank thought it was a joke when an 8-year-old told her to hand over her money or he'd kill her. When she refused, the youngster flashed a knife. She ran to her van. He threw the knife at her as she drove off. `` I just thought it was a kid messing around, so I told him to beat it,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamusta </PERSON>. `` Then he pulled out a knife, and I took him seriously.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lamusta </PERSON> drove to a nearby convenience store and called police, who arrested the boy and a 12-year-old friend a short time later. The two boys were charged with attempted armed robbery, said Lt. F.M. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. Police could not release the suspects' names because they are juveniles. `` It's sort of discouraging to think that our society has gotten that bad,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. `` It tells me our whole system is out of whack.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lamusta </PERSON>, a mother of three adult children, said she could not believe it either. `` Kids do strange things,'' she said. `` It upset me.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lamusta </PERSON> told police she had seen the boys sitting under a tree when she first pulled up at the bank. `` It's a busy intersection there,'' she said. `` It never occurred to me that anyone would be up to any shenanigans.''

 <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> today rejected the Vietnamese-installed government's latest peace plan, but said he was willing to meet with Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>. The warring Cambodian factions today met for a second day of informal talks at the Dutch colonial summer palace of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s late President <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Bogor </LOCATION>, about 35 miles outside <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> resigned July 10 as president of the guerrilla coalition fighting the government and Vietnamese troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. He is widely considered central to any settlement in the 9 -LCB- year civil war, but vowed he would not attend the peace talks that began Monday. The talks bring together Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and the leaders of the three resistance groups _ <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, and Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON>, who represents his father, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. In a meeting today with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ambassador in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> rejected a seven-point plan proposed by <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> as an old proposal aimed at preserving the current <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government, Japanese reporters said. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> told Ambassador <PERSON> Sumio </PERSON> <PERSON> Edamura </PERSON> that he was willing to attend talks in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>'s presidential palace Wednesday with <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s guerrilla coalition partners, <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said he would make `` a very important speech'' then, according to the Japanese journalists. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1941 to 1970, also said he would meet with President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> at a dinner Wednesday. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON>, who organized the talks today and Monday, said the atmosphere at Monday's session was good and that the talks would last `` as long as it takes.'' He said the Cambodian factions agreed on the need for a new coalition government and a neutral, non-aligned <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and has more than 100,000 troops there supporting the <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> government. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> met the guerrillas for the first time ever during the talks Monday. Officials said the Cambodians previously have agreed that an early political settlement is necessary, that a new coalition government must be formed and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> must become a neutral and non-aligned nation. But <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> told reporters he and the guerrilla leaders resolved no concrete problems Monday. He presented at the talks a seven-point peace plan containing proposals already rejected by the guerrillas. The plan said that before elections for a new government, the status quo must be maintained _ defying guerrilla demands that <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s government be dismantled before elections. In one new move, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said that in order to bridge this dispute he was proposing formation of a `` national reconciliation council'' headed by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> to implement any peace agreements and organize elections. The plan also repeated demands for elimination of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leadership, and dissolution of its army, the largest of the guerrilla forces. Only this, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said, would ensure the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> can not return to power. From 1975 until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded, the fanatical <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime killed hundreds of thousands of people in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and launched bloody attacks on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s western border. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> say the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is storing arms for all-out attacks when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraws all its troops by 1990, as it has pledged. However, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which arms the guerrillas, recently indicated it was prepared to lessen its once-unequivocal support for the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and said it supported a government in which the group would not have a dominant role.

 Orders for `` big ticket'' durable goods, propelled by a big jump in aircraft orders, increased 8.8 percent in June, the largest advance in 42 months, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders totaled $ 125.23 billion last month, an increase of $ 10.14 billion over the May figure. Virtually all of the gain reflected a big jump in orders for aircraft. The transportation category shot up 35.5 percent to $ 38.24 billion last month. Without this gain, total orders would have risen only 0.1 percent, the government said. The big increase in total orders had been expected because of announcements by the Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of a string of giant orders for commercial aircraft in recent weeks. Those orders have totaled $ 8 billion. But the report said that demand for commerical aircraft rose by about $ 3 billion, indicating that the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> orders will show up in coming months. The overall increase of 8.8 percent was the largest single-month gain since an 8.9 percent increase in December 1985, also a month when the orders report was propelled by a big jump in the transportation category. While there have been concerns that high factory operating rates would contribute to inflationary pressures, economists said they were not too alarmed by the big jump in manufacturing orders in June since it was contained in one industry. The 0.1 percent rise in demand excluding the transportation category was slightly below expectations. The overall increase of 8.8 percent followed a 1.9 percent drop in May which had been the biggest setback since last August. Manufacturing has been one of the top performers of the economy this year as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies have benefited from rising export demand. The 35.5 percent jump in transportation orders was the biggest increase since a 45.3 percent rise in December 1985. In addition to the strong gain in aircraft, the shipbuilding and tanks categories also reflected big increases as the military stepped up its orders. The total defense category showed a gain of 88.6 percent last month, the biggest advance since a 123.2 percent rise in December 1982. The category of non-defense capital goods posted a 9.8 percent increase to $ 34.57 billion with the $ 3.1 billion increase reflecting the rise in commercial aircraft orders. Orders for electrical machinery were up for the third consecutive month with the June increase a 0.6 percent advance to $ 20.3 billion. Orders for non-electrical machinery rose 1.3 percent to $ 20.8 billion. Orders for primary metals fell 3.5 percent to $ 411.5 billion. This was the first decline since January. Shipments of durable goods rose 1.5 percent to $ 116.3 billion in June following a 1.8 percent increase in May.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Angry Mourners At Funeral of Christian Arab</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of Palestinian mourners shook their fists and chanted anti-Israeli slogans today at a memorial service for a Christian Arab killed by Israeli troops. <PERSON> Jeris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunkar </PERSON>, 40, a tailor from the town of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jalla </LOCATION> near the biblical city of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, was hit by three bullets during anti-Israeli protests Sunday. The army said <PERSON> Kunkar </PERSON> was shot accidentally when a soldier chasing Arab stone-throwers stumbled and his gun discharged. Palestinians said <PERSON> Kunkar </PERSON> was not involved in the violence and happened to step out of his house when he was hit by bullets. Mourners today decked the <LOCATION> Kunkar </LOCATION> home with outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and chanted, `` With our spirit and blood, we will avenge the martyr'' as church bells pealed in the background. The army stayed away from <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jalla </LOCATION> during the service, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. <PERSON> Kunkar </PERSON> was the third <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> to die over the past 10 days and the fourth since the Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupied teritories began last Dec. 8. A total of 233 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed. The deaths of Christian Arabs have heightened anti-Israeli sentiment among <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christians </LOCATION>, considered more moderate than their Moslem brethren. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, a small home-made bomb exploded today in the outdoor market but did not cause damage or injuries, an army spokeswoman said. She said soldiers closed off the area and carried out searches. In another development, the army asked the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to lodge a complaint against <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s consul in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewulf </PERSON>. The army charged <PERSON> Dewulf </PERSON> spat at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers guarding a Palestinian prisoner and knocked away one soldier's hand. An army spokeswoman said the incident occurred last week outside the military government building in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. A Foreign Ministry official said the matter would be investigated. He told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Dewulf </PERSON> acknowledged giving the soldiers a disapproving look, but denied spitting at them. Officials at the Belgian Consulate refused comment and referred queries to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>.

 The government announced it will stop funding research into the development of a space plane because the project is too expensive for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, which caused commuter misery for three months while under repair, was fully opened to traffic today for the first time in three months. `` The bridge is now stronger than it's been since World War II,'' said Transportation Commissioner <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> as he watched the first cars roll over the last four lanes that had been closed. The rusting 85-year-old span was closed April 12; two lanes for motorists traveling from <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> were opened in May and another two in June. Subway service was also restored in June. The opening of all lanes this morning came two weeks ahead of schedule. Brooklyn-bound trucks remain forbidden, but should be allowed on the bridge come mid-August, <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> said. Work was done on what <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> called an emergency contract basis, which meant workers labored seven days a week to add 150 tons of steel to the bridge. He said the total cost was just under $ 10 million. `` We did a five-year job in three months,'' said Deputy Transportation Commissioner <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>. An estimated 107,000 vehicles and 420 subway trains crossed the bridge each day before its closure. The closure tied up traffic in southern <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, added to problems throughout the city and forced the city <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> to reroute trains.

 Iran-Contra prosecutor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> says <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> is trying to turn his trial from a criminal to a political one and should not be allowed to use politics to win a six-month delay. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> on Monday to reject <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s motion for a delay until after the presidential election. `` Having failed in several attempts to avoid completely the trial of this case, while proclaiming his innocence in speeches, the defendant <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> is now grasping at the criminal defendant's maneuver of last resort _ delay,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` This trial in particular should not be held hostage to a media which the defendant himself has strenuously sought to inflame,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in a brief filed with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> also rebutted <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s contention that his actions had been approved. `` The government knows of no presidential decision that <PERSON> North </PERSON> can point to as authorizing his activities,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said, adding: `` The government also is not aware of any superior, except <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s co-conspirators -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> -RRB- </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, who knew enough about <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s activities to have conveyed even informal or implicit approval.'' Had <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> found <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responsible for authorizing <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s activities, the prosecutor would have been unable to charge North in March with defrauding the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because <PERSON> North </PERSON> would have been acting with the necessary presidential approval The prosecutor included 15 newspaper clippings reporting <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s recent speeches about his case and in support of Republican congressional candidates He quoted <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s own statement after his indictment last March: `` I have now been caught in a bitter dispute between the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president over the control of foreign policy. ... It is a shame that the new battleground for such a fight will be a courtroom.'' Delaying the trial would give court approval to `` North's transparent attempt to transform this trial from a criminal into a political one,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> argued A retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel and former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide, <PERSON> North </PERSON> is the first of four defendants scheduled to be tried on charges including a conspiracy to defraud the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by illegally diverting profits from U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. Last Wednesday, one of North's attorneys, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, told the court that ` no fair-minded person could argue that this trial should be started seven weeks prior to the presidential election. The intense publicity generated during the final seven weeks of a presidential campaign would deny -LRB- North -RRB- a fair trial.'' But <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said, `` To the extent that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial may become a political issue in the upcoming elections, North bears at least a substantial measure of responsibility, and therefore has little credibility in complaining.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> has made many pretrial speeches and statements `` in which he had claimed that the charges should be evaluated in a political context.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial could begin Sept. 20 as planned with an impartial jury despite the presidential campaign and urged <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to reject <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s motion for a six-month delay, which <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said was filed `` simply as a stalling tactic.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said courts in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> are well trained by their experience with Watergate and other political scandals to conduct trials in cases which receive a lot of publicity. He said the trial would draw media attention no matter when it occurred and that much of this publicity has been favorable to the defendants. Of the 16 counts against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said those involving false statements and obstruction of justice, personal enrichment and tax fraud could easily be tried Sept. 20. To meet that date for the conspiracy, theft of government property and wire fraud charges, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> would have to modify a July 6 order granting North access to additional classified documents. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> enclosed a letter from <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> general counsel <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruemmer </PERSON> to support such a modification. <PERSON> Bruemmer </PERSON> said some of the documents already had been provided, others including excepts from the President's Daily Brief on intelligence matters, and summaries by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> could be ready in four weeks, but others are not readily available and would require several months to gather. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ordered the documents on the basis of a meeting with defense lawyers from which prosecutors were excluded. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said no defense argument he could envision would make the documents relevant to the case. He indicated that most of them refer to other government covert actions abroad and said no other covert action had ever involved the transfer of funds from one operation to another. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to require North to come up with more specific reasons for seeing items before they are ordered turned over to him. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> did not rule on the motion immediately.

 Gunmen in a speeding car shot and killed a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> sergeant while he was jogging with his dogs in a neighborhood near <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, police said today. In a separate incident, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> authorities said the Filipino wife of an American serviceman was robbed and slain Sunday night near the base, located 50 miles north of the capital <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Police said both incidents appeared to be criminal and not related to the 19-year communist insurgency. Communist rebels operate in the <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area and have threatened to attack American military personnel. News of the killings came as talks between the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases here broke down over compensation. The rift was expected to fuel Filipino sentiment against the bases. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> panel in the talks, described the suspension as a `` temporary break in the talks.'' But the chief Filipino negotiator said the two sides were so far apart he doubted talks could resume. Police said Tech. Sgt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmer </PERSON>, 31, of the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, was jogging near his home in the <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION> subdivision about 9:30 p.m. Monday when gunmen opened fire with M-16 rifles. His home is about one mile from the base's main gate. The assailants also killed his two German shepherd dogs, police added. Police officers who spoke on condition of anonymity said a preliminary investigation indicated the killing may have been the result of a marital dispute. They said <PERSON> Blackmer </PERSON> was estranged from his Filipino wife and was living with another woman. Police picked up the wife, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, for questioning late Monday but said no charges had been filed. <PERSON> Blackmer </PERSON> was the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> service member slain in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> since October, when communist rebels killed two <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> enlisted men, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> sergeant and a Filipino civilian of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ancestry. But a Filipino investigator, who also requested anonymity, said the style of the killing and weapons used did not fit the pattern of guerrilla atacks. Rebel assassination teams normally use .45 - caliber pistols and fire at close range, he In the other incident, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Billa </PERSON> <PERSON> Heacox </PERSON>, 41, wife of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heacox </PERSON>, was found fatally stabbed late Sunday about three miles north of <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>. Master Sgt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Mrs. <PERSON> Heacox </PERSON>'s body was found in the car after witnesses saw the vehicle run off the road and two Filipino males flee. Her husband, assigned to a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> communications station in nearby <LOCATION> Arlac </LOCATION> province, said the victim left their home to drive <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and was carrying about $ 150, which was missing. A base spokeswoman, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Maryellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jadick </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities had not imposed any new retrictions on the nearly 26,000 American troops, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> civilians and dependents living in this city of some 200,000. Nearly 40 people have been killed in <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and other communities around Clark Air Base this year. Police say many of the slayings are politically motivated. Communist rebels have been fighting to overthrow the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government since 1969. In December last year, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense secretary for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said the Pentagon was taking steps to protect the 8,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen stationed at <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and 6,000 uniformed personnel at the <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>. They are the two largest American military installations outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said measures included tighter security on the bases, reductions in off-base leaves, anti-terrorist training for servicemen, reduction in travel to the bases and increased police patrol in the city outside <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> officials have agreed to improve security, but no details have been announced. About 40,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen, civilian personnel and dependents live near <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and four smaller <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations.

<HEAD>Zoo Plans Unprecedented Effort to Save Expected Panda Cub</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, where four panda cubs have been stillborn or died shortly after birth, said today an unprecedented technological effort is planned to save the expected offspring of female giant panda Ling-Ling. `` We're, in fact, taking a step that's altogether unprecedented, but really on the best medical advice,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the zoo's director, in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America''. <PERSON> Ling-Ling </PERSON>, who lives with her mate <LOCATION> Hsing-Hsing </LOCATION> in the zoo's <ORGANIZATION> Panda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, gave birth to three stillborn cubs before giving birth to a live cub last year Zoo employees' hopes were raised when that baby was born apparently healthy and screaming lustily, but the cub died four days later. `` What happened last year is that the baby had no immune system,'' said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` When we did the autopsy, -LRB- we found -RRB- there were no immunoglobulins in the baby's blood. And that means that it had no protection against any kind of bacteria that it could encounter in the world around it.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said zoo officials, who in the past have not intervened with panda births for fear of alienating the mother from her baby, will be aggressive from the start this year. They believe the female panda will give birth this weekend or early next week. `` We're going to remove the baby from the mother and inject it with immunoglobulins we've extracted from his -LRB- <LOCATION> Hsing-Hsing </LOCATION>'s -RRB- blood, and hope that that will confer a greater immunity than the last one had,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` We're going to be extraordinarily careful about that, of course,'' he added. `` The baby will be removed by our veterinarians wearing surgical gloves and gowns and masks in the usual way, so it should n't acquire any human odor. And we will treat it before we return it to Ling-Ling with materials from the mother so that it acquires her odor.'' Zoo offiicals believe <PERSON> Ling-Ling </PERSON> is pregnant because she mated with <LOCATION> Hsing-Hsing </LOCATION> three times in April during her brief annual period of fertility, according to <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. He said her hormone levels are similar to those she displayed at this stage in her pregnancy last year. Zoo officials believe the 19-year-old <PERSON> Ling-Ling </PERSON> is nearing the end of her childbearing years. Nobody knows how many years pandas are fertile, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` The estimates are between 19 and 23 or 24 years. But there are no good longevity records on pandas from anywhere in the world, so that's just ` guess-timating'.'' Only about 1,000 of the endangered giant pandas are alive in the world today, including just 14 outside of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> broke off talks today with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases and Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said differences over compensation were so wide he doubted the talks could be revived. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> made the remark to reporters after a meeting with President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> during which he informed her the nearly 4-month-old talks were suspended indefinitely. `` I do n't know whether the talks can resume ... but right now, our positions are so far apart that I do n't think we can resume,'' he said. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, head of the Philippine panel in the negotiations, said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> `` realizes that our position is a reasonable one and that we should stick to it.'' He declined to elaborate, saying revealing more details could create more difficulties. The <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> government is pressing for an increase in the $ 180 million it receives annually from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for use of the bases. Before the talks began, <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said $ 1.2 billion annually would be `` more realistic.'' The talks are held every five years to review terms of the 1947 agreement allowing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to maintain <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller installations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview the break was temporary and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side, headed by Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, expects the talks to resume `` shortly.'' She denied the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> panel approved a statement that Filipino spokesman <PERSON> Leonides </PERSON> <PERSON> Caday </PERSON> described as a joint statement and read to reporters. It said: `` There was a substantial disagreement on the compensation issue, as a result of which the -LRB- Philippine -RRB- panel moved for the suspension of the talks.'' `` As has happened several times in the past, there has been a temporary break in the talks,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said. `` We do not consider the talks suspended. Such temporary breaks occur from time to time particularly when one side needs time to consider a proposal from the other.'' During previous interruptions, however, neither side had described the talks as `` suspended.'' In previous instances, spokesmen for both sides said talks had been temporarily recessed because of foreign travel by negotiators or to allow time to study proposals. On Monday, <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said that the two panels were nearing agreement but that they may not complete the negotiations by an end-of-the-month deadline. The talks had initially been scheduled to end during the first week of July. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not oppose an increase in compensation but would not agree to paying any `` staggering amount.'' The talks do not directly affect the status of the bases after 1991, but a successful review is widely expected to influence <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s decision on whether to extend the agreement. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to reveal her position. Meanwhile, the communist-led <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, accused Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> maneuvering for `` an impending sell-out of our national sovereignty and interests.'' The front, an umbrella organization of 12 Marxist rebel groups, said in a statement delivered to news agencies by courier that the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> administration `` has actually agreed to retain the bases beyond -LRB- 1991 -RRB- in exchange for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assurance of its survival.''

<HEAD>USIA Hints U.S. Will Abandon Cultural Exchange Treaty Over Court
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may abandon an international cultural exchange agreement if it loses a court battle with documentary filmmakers over allegations of censorship, a federal official suggested in a court filing. The threat by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, is the latest development in a battle over allegations the agency has hampered international distribution of documentaries with liberal themes. Movies that are certified by the <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> as being of an educational, scientific or cultural nature are exempt from import duties in some 60 countries under a 40-year-old international treaty known as the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Agreement. The suit, filed in December 1985 on behalf of makers of movies on subjects ranging from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to nuclear power, accuses the <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> of, in effect, censoring the work of liberal moviemakers by making it more expensive to export their work. Two courts have sided with the moviemakers, ordering the <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> to rewrite its rules for determining whether a movie is of an educational, scientific or cultural nature. If the government fails to get the rulings reversed, <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> said in a statement to be filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, `` it is my intent to recommend that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> terminate its participation in the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Agreement.'' An attorney for the seven moviemakers in the case, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, called <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>'s response unreasonable `` It's like the kid with the football who says, ` If I ca n't win the game, I'm taking the ball home,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials handling the case did not respond to a telephone request for comment. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashima </PERSON> sided with the moviemakers in 1986, ruling that the <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> policies violated the moviemakers' constitutional rights to free speech. He ordered the agency to redraft its rules. Last May, <PERSON> Tashima </PERSON> rejected new rules, which included a provision allowing the government to brand a movie propaganda. The <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> has appealed that ruling and has asked the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, which upheld a challenge to <PERSON> Tashima </PERSON>'s original ruling, to reconsider. <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> wrote that the redrafted rules were a good-faith attempt to implement the court order and that broadening the rules further would amount to abandoning the treaty. In keeping with its interpretation of the treaty, the agency demanded that movies that advocate a point of view acknowledge that another point of view exists, <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said his organization, a public interest lawyers group, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> have drafted a proposed set of rules for movie certification, but <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> officials had refused to consider it.

 Riot police today arrested about 1,400 striking locomotive engineers and their relatives whose protests paralyzed the national railway system. Police said thousands of riot police were mobilized to disperse sit-ins by engineers and their supporters at railway stations in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities. The strikers were demanding higher pay and shorter working hours. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, hundreds of police stormed a <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> building and arrested about 300 engineers. No clashes were reported. Police said they would release most of the detainees, but that others would be charged with illegal activity under laws banning wildcat strikes by government officials. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, a government agency, said the strike _ which began shortly after midnight _ disrupted about 90 percent of normal daily service of 2,050 trains and affected more than 1 million passengers. The engineers, who earn an average of $ 1,230 a month, are demanding a 100 percent increase in wages, including overtime. About 4,400 train engineers and their assistants work for the national railroad. The railroad management has offered the workers a reduction in working hours from the current average of 245 hours to 224 hours a month, in addition to monthly raises from about $ 100 to about $ 138.

 The last newspaper union to oppose a proposed partial merger of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s two major newspapers has dropped its objections, and backers say the plan now meets all requirements for federal approval.

Five other newspaper unions have endorsed the proposal. <ORGANIZATION> Knight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the News, filed a statement with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> saying the merger application meets the standards for approval set by the Newspaper Preservation Act The newspapers asked the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 for an exemption in antitrust law allowing them to merge business, advertising and circulation departments. Editorial departments would remain separate. A spokesman for Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who must rule on such exemptions, has said he will decide on it before he leaves office, which a spokesman has said will be by Aug. 15. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the Guild's new position would not affect his ruling. He declined further comment. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> has said if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> rejects the request, it would close the Free Press, resulting in the loss of 2,200 jobs. Both newspapers claim they have lost millions of dollars in recent years. The Guild's agreement with the Free Press reduces the number of Guild members to be laid off at the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> under a joint operating agreement from 100 to no more than 75. The agreement also guarantees the jobs of 45 maintenance workers at the News. The Guild represents about 650 editorial and business employees at the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and about 300 editorial workers at the News. The Guild filed a statement with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> which `` urges that the -LRB- merger -RRB- be approved.'' The statement said the union has become convinced `` that the closing of the Free Press is inevitable if the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> is not approved.'' Knight Ridder issued a statement Monday welcoming the Guild's decision News President and <PERSON> Publisher </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weil </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> declined to comment. The Free Press had 1987 circulation of 639,720 daily and 724,342 on Sundays, while circulation of the News was 678,720 daily and 839,319 on Sundays, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circulation </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>WADLEY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mayor B.A. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> has ordered police to `` shoot to stop'' anyone caught fighting in the city's park. `` There has been too much fighting in the park _ young men from <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, young men from <LOCATION> Bartow </LOCATION>, young men from <LOCATION> Wadley </LOCATION> _ and the only way to break it up is for police to shoot them,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Monday. The mayor said fighting in the 12-acre Hope Williams Memorial Park has been a frequent problem, but Sunday's brawl involving eight youths who used `` big sticks with nails driven in them'' as weapons prompted him to take action against such skirmishes. He said no one was seriously injured in the fight, but it presented a threat to the families and children who wanted to use the park as well as a threat to the town's reputation. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> has ordered an increased police patrol in the park during weekends. `` There will be a full-time policeman every Friday, Saturday and Sunday,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` They are to shoot from the waist down only.'' `` We're going to fix it so decent people can go to the park. All the hoodlums in <LOCATION> Bartow </LOCATION>, stay in <LOCATION> Bartow </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` All the hoodlums in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, stay in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, and all the hoodlums in <LOCATION> Wadley </LOCATION> have been suspended from the park for the rest of the year.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he also has increased the fine for fighting in the park from $ 71.50 to $ 125. Reports from the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said seven of the eight involved in Sunday's fight were juveniles and were turned over to juvenile authorities. The adult was charged with fighting and released on a $ 125 bond. <PERSON> Wadley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bartow </LOCATION> are in a rural area of eastern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> about 130 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s `` shoot to stop'' order is the latest in a series of such orders he has issued in the past three years. In 1986, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> issued a `` shoot to wound'' order _ instructing police officers to shoot suspected burglars from the waist down _ after a rash of burglaries in the east <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> town of 2,700. In 1985, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> ordered police to shoot stray dogs on sight to control the animals, which city officials said roamed the streets in packs, destroyed property, snapped at children and howled at the moon. He even offered a bounty of $ 3 for every dog shot. No shooting ever took place and both orders were eventually rescinded. Also in 1985, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> ordered police to arrest anyone using profane language in public. The order was aimed at young people playing basketball in the city park whose games were frequently accompanied by loud streams of what then-City Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> described as `` pure, unadulterated profanity.''

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of nurses and other hospital workers today struck seven hospitals in a contract dispute that focuses on health insurance benefits. Picket lines went up shortly after 6 a.m., union spokesman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. The strike was the first in the 50-year history of Local 250 of the Hospital and <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, which has 1,700 members. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the hospitals, said Monday that patients would not be affected by the walkout by licensed vocational nurses, aides, housekeepers and laundry workers. The six hospitals in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and one in neighboring <LOCATION> Daly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hired additional workers and also will use management employees, she said. Union officials disputed the hospitals' claim that patient care would not suffer. `` The union takes the stand that that attitude is irresponsible. You ca n't take away 1,700 workers from seven institutions and expect it not to have any effect,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Twarog </PERSON>, Local 250's chief negotiator As Affiliated Hospitals of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the hospitals had negotiated with Local 250 for a new, two-year contract since February. A federal mediator adjourned talks Saturday because no progress had been made. Health insurance was the major issue in the dispute. Affiliated Hospitals offered full coverage at no cost to employees, but a new provision would require contributions of $ 30 a month from full-time employees for family benefits. Also at issue were wages, with Affiliated Hospitals offering 3 percent raises for vocational nurses and lower-tier employees and no increase for higher-tier workers. Pay currently ranges from $ 7.90 an hour for housekeeping, laundry and food service employees and hospital aides to $ 11.70 an hour for technicians and vocational nurses. Talks continued between six of the hospitals and about 2,000 registered nurses. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has voted to strike Aug. 2 if no agreement is reached. The hospitals are <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, Children's, Pacific Presbyterian and Mt.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s ruling party today chose its No. 4 ranked leader _ <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> _ as party chairman to replace <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, who wielded authoritarian power over this Southeast Asian nation for a quarter century. A brief news release said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> elected the 64-year-old retired army general during a special session. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a hardliner widely criticized for his ruthless handling of student demonstrations, has served as the party's joint general secretary since 1985. He also holds the government post of <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> secretary. His elevation to the country's top post appeared to dash hopes among the public here that Ne Win's retirement would lead to widespread reform of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s one-party, military-backed system. Shortly after the announcement, state radio reported that Prime Minister <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kha </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Myint </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> had been dismissed from their posts after being found reponsible for bloody student riots here last March. It was <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> who was widely criticized in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> for the brutal suppression of those riots, in which 100 people are said to have been killed. The radio annoucement gave no further details. Ne Win asked to step down Saturday after 26 years in power. On Monday, a special party congress accepted his resignation and that of the second most powerful figure in the country _ party Vice Chairman <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu </PERSON>, also the country's president. The 77-year-old Ne Win, who came to power in a 1962 military coup, cited violent anti-government rioting in March and June, for which he acknowledged some reponsibility, and his age as reasons for stepping down. Today's news release said the vice chairmanship of the party was left vacant and <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON>, who some had expected to succeed Ne Win, retained the No. 3 job of general secretary. It was not clear why <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> was passed over for the top job. A three-day special party congress ended Monday with little but vaguely-worded statements issued to the public, possibly reflecting splits within the party over recent events. After the congress ended the 1,061 delegates were suddenly summoned back _ some from areas outside <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> _ but the session did not reconvene. Official Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> announced Monday that delegates had `` firmly suggested'' rejecting a referendum called by Ne Win which could have ended 26 years of one-party rule. It marked the first known instance in which the party did not rubber-stamp Ne Win's proposals. State radio announced late Sunday that an emergency parliament session would convene Wednesday, apparently to act on the referendum proposal. Although the parliament is empowered to order a referendum by majority vote, it is not expected to oppose the party decision. The emergency session could also deal with the appointment of a new president to replace <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yu </LOCATION>. By tradition a party leader who quits his party post also resigns his government job. The political changes in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> follow months of street riots and deepening public discontent over the country's deteriorating economic situation. Public anger peaked last October when the government withdrew several currency notes from circulation and failed to provide any compensation, sparking the first major riots in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> since 1974. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> commanded the military forces that brutally put down a student protest in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> last March in which more than 100 people are said to have died. Recently the government admitted that 41 protesters suffocated in a van after their arrests. He also commanded an army company which killed 22 students during anti-government demonstrations at <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in July 1962. Efforts to liberalize the economy last year failed to stop <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s downward spiral. Inflation is soaring, government stores are virtually empty and the country is saddled with a foreign debt of about $ 4 billion. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> was among several party members who offered their resignations alonmg with Ne Win last week. But the party congress rejected them, saying the leaders were still young enough to rule. Succeeding <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> as joint general secretary was <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Htin </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as well as deputy prime minister and defense minster.

<TEXT>
 Major collective bargaining settlements in private industry during the first six months of this year provided for wage increases averaging 2.2 percent a year, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that the last time these settlements were negotiated, generally in 1985 or 1986, the wage increases over the life of the contract averaged 2.9 percent. The contracts negotiated in the first six months of the year involved 1.02 million workers. The report said that the average pay increase for the first year of the contracts was 2.6 percent, compared to a first-year wage boost of 2.3 percent the last time labor and management in these industries negotiated. Meanwhile, in a second report, the department said that wage and benefit increases rose 4.6 percent for the 12 months ending in June. This compared to a 3.3 percent increase during the same period a year ago. This increase included wages and benefits such as employee contributions to health and pension plans.

 A woman who hijacked an airliner with 146 people aboard to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> 19 years ago has been arrested in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, where she has lived for five years under assumed names, authorities said. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>, 39, was arrested Monday, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, who added they have 14 aliases listed for her. She was living under the name of <PERSON> Haziine </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON> with her husband and five children. A hearing to certify <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>'s identity was postponed until Wednesday. <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON>, told acting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Scully </PERSON> that a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> lawyer had agreed to represent his wife, but could not get to <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> today. <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON>, also a lawyer, said the identification of his wife as the hijacker was `` absolute poppycock.'' <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> and her then-husband, <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, took a 2-year-old boy hostage on an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Jan. 2, 1969, then forced the pilot at gunpoint to fly to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, authorities said. While running up the aisle, <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> shouted `` Black Power'' and `` <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>,'' according to authorities. None of the 138 passengers or eight crew members was hurt. Grinage and <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> were indicted on air piracy charges later that year, although they remained in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> for a time after the passengers and crew returned, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> died in 1971 from wounds he received during a shootout with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police while fleeing a bank robbery. Authorities did not say how or when <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> and <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> re-entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> had been living in the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> area since 1983 but police were not tipped about her whereabouts until receiving an anonymous phone call in July 1987, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. Police did not make an arrest until Monday because they needed time to confirm her identity, she said. Authorities did that through writing samples and telephone records of a phone call made to the Rev. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Staten </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>'s grandfather, according to an affidavit made for a search warrant. <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>, who wore a red bandanna, jeans and a T-shirt in court, walked by reporters without commenting. <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON> said he believed the arrest was a mistake. The charges are `` completely inconsistent with the person I know,'' <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON> said. `` It's absolute poppycock. It makes excellent fiction.'' In court, <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON> said his wife `` has roots in the community, is gainfully employed in the community and has resided in the community for 10 years.'' `` She is unable to respond in her present state,'' <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON> told <PERSON> Scully </PERSON>, describing his wife as `` distraught.'' If convicted, she could be imprisoned for 20 years to life. <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> had at least six addresses in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> since 1983. The prosecutor said she was n't aware that the woman had a job. <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON> said she would ask that <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> be held without bail, and would not comment on whether authorities would pursue charges against <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON>.

 Firefighters today called in helicopters and said they would use natural barriers to try to maneuver a forest fire that burned within 10 miles of Old Faithful geyser in parched Yellowstone National Park. Helicopters slinging torches that spit a napalm-like substance were called in, and ground crews used meadows and streams as a wall against the fire, said Incident Commander <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplinger </PERSON>. A final decision on sending out the helicopters was expected later today. `` What we can do, we can go out to one side or the other of the head of a fire, and ignite fire and get it to building and have it draw the head of the fire in one direction or another,'' he said this morning. `` We would just be trying to further influence the fire. It's going in the direction that we want it to go, but the more we can get it going in a more northerly direction, the better,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Smart </PERSON>, fire planning coordinator, said today About 450 firefighters moved into the area Monday, and by tonight the total was expected to swell to 800 to protect the Old Faithful complex of hotels and cabins from the North Fork fire, which covered more than 2,700 acres. While officials earlier had said the fire burned to within eight miles of the geyser, <PERSON> Caplinger </PERSON> said it was still 10 to 12 miles to the west today and burning toward the northeast. `` The fire will burn to the northeast and will miss the Old Faithful area,'' Fire Information Officer <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Poague </PERSON> predicted late Monday. `` We're not in as much jeopardy as we thought we were.'' Blazes in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s oldest national park have blackened about 52,400 acres of its 2.2 million acres, which is mostly in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s northwest corner but extends into <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> In addition to <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, wildfires burned in sections of seven other Western states and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Nearly 15 miles southeast of Old Faithful, hot embers Monday night rained down on <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, burning through power lines as the 4,500-acre Shoshone fire and the 3,000-acre Red fire approached the area. The fire did not damage a small hotel, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> staff apartments and several house trailers in the area because they were made of cinder block and other non-flammable materials, <PERSON> Poague </PERSON> said. The area was evacuated last weekend, along with the <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> campground nearly 10 miles to the southwest and the park's southern entrance was closed. At <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, the fires burned to within one-eighth of a mile of the campground, and crews hosed down structures to keep them from catching fire, <PERSON> Poague </PERSON> said. About 500 firefighters battled both blazes. The threat to the Old Faithful area had seemed more serious because of aerial surveys and misleading winds, <PERSON> Poague </PERSON> said. Ground winds blew the blaze northeast into backcountry where it could burn untended, away from the geyser that erupts every 30 to 100 minutes, <PERSON> Poague </PERSON> said. But another wind at a higher altitude blew smoke west, toward <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Faithful </LOCATION>, making it seem the blaze was headed that way. No services or accommodations at Old Faithful have been closed, but visitors have been advised such action may be necessary, said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>. About 1,200 guests generally spend a night at the historic Old Faithful Inn, the Snow Lodge and cabins in the area around Old Faithful, said park Assistant Superintendent <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Clary </PERSON>. Crews also fought the 31,500-acre Clover Mist fire in the park's eastern half to keep it out of adjacent <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Poague </PERSON> said In the Teton Wilderness along <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s southern border, more than 700 firefighters made progress today along the northern side of the 24,400-acre Mink Creek fire, working to keep it from spreading into <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meadows </LOCATION> and Shoshone, officials said. Precipitation at <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> is 7.5 inches below normal for the year, and the Old Faithful area got just 0.75 of an inch of rain in June, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Other fires crackled across hundreds of acres of brush and forest elsewhere in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and in parts of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Temperatures Monday climbed to more than 100 degrees in sections of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Firefighters in central and northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> mopped up dozens of little fires while more lightning strikes were reported in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> range. Crews virtually extinguished a pair of fires in <LOCATION> Calaveras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> that burned about 11,000 acres and eight homes, officials said. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where more than 50 fires have charred about 1.2 million acres, firefighters were battling only 22 of the blazes. Among the many fires in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, one near <LOCATION> Waring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Kotzebue </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, had jumped in size by 10,000 acres, spreading to 207,000 acres, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the blaze destroyed an unoccupied cabin and authorities were unsure if it was abandoned or in use. Fire lines were holding in check a 323,000-acre fire near <LOCATION> Livengood </LOCATION> in interior <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. It was just seven miles from the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, but the line was in no danger, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Party Condemns `Extremist' Activists in Territorial Dispute</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> today sharply criticized activists who led a six-month campaign to annex an Armenian region in a neighboring republic. The party position, outlined in the newspaper Pravda, reflected an unusually harsh line against those pressing for Armenian control of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a mostly Armenian enclave in neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Coming after a hardline speech by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in which he rejected ethnically motivated claims, it seemed designed to show pro-annexation activists they could no longer count on high-level support. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s parliament voted in June to annex <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Azerbaijani authorities opposed the change, and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> last week deemed annexation `` impossible.'' Pravda reported that party leaders in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> met Monday to discuss `` the instigatoray character of speeches at meetings'' held in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital. The Armenian leaders `` condemned the extremist, instigatory, politically harmful speeches and urged ... all the ideological agencies to launch effective efforts to expose the anti-people character ... of the activists,'' Pravda reported. Armenians account for about three-quarters of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s 162,000 residents, and they have complained of mistreatment by the government of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, which is predominantly Moslem Most Armenians are Christians. Labor unrest that brought <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to a virtual standstill for two months began subsiding Monday, when <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 78 percent of the region's workers showed up at their jobs. Both the state-run media and activists in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s central city, reported Monday that the strikes were over and business was proceeding at a normal pace. Some have vowed to continue the fight for annexation, but central authorities have made it clear that a tougher stance will be taken by police in future demonstrations or work stoppages. Activists in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> called last week for a five-day strike to protest the July 18 decision by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, but most residents ignored the proposal.

<HEAD>Government Drops Proceedings Against Research Vessel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government is dropping forfeiture proceedings against the owners of a top ocean research vessel that had been seized under the government's `` zero tolerance'' anti-drug policy, an attorney said. The multimillion-dollar vessel is being released because the <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> did n't know any drugs were aboard, according to its attorney, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Zvetina </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zvetina </PERSON> said he was notified Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has decided to drop forfeiture proceedings. The vessel had been seized May 18 after Customs officers found a trace of marijuana and two drug-related pipes when the vessel returned from a trip off the coast of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Atlantis II, a 210-foot vessel that participated in the 1986 exploration of the sunken liner Titanic, had been allowed to continue its scheduled scientific voyages, but the institute was required to inform Customs of its movement pending the outcome of forfeiture proceedings. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the forfeiture proceedings will be formally terminated after Woods Hole pays the expenses of the seizure. However, <PERSON> Zvetina </PERSON> said the institute may not have to pay any expenses because its personnel operated the ship during the entire seizure period. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which has authority over <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION>, determined the institute was innocent because it had no knowledge of the drugs and had taken reasonable precautions to prevent a violation, <PERSON> Zvetina </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, the crew member in whose stateroom the marijuana was found, pleaded guilty in May to a misdemeanor charge of possession of a controlled substance. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Buzzards </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, was sentenced to one year of unsupervised probation and fined $ 100. Capt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Coburn </PERSON>, marine operations manager for the institute, said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> also was put on three months' suspension.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> said today it would be `` very difficult'' to restore normal relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> before the release of hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian extremists. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said he thought it was unlikely there would be any re-establishment of relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, at least in the next couple of months, because of the hostage situation. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> made the remarks amid statements from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that it is prepared to discuss the hostage problem with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but only with authoritative figures and with no deal-making. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked Monday whether the time had come to talk to Iranian officials about the hostages, replied, `` If they're willing and ready to talk, it's time. The administration has expressed interest in establishing a dialogue with `` authoritative'' Iranian leaders, but no official has yet publicly suggested that a rapprochement could take place in the absence of a hostage release. In an interview on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning'', <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> was asked if it was possible to normalize relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> before the nine American hostages are released. `` Well, it would be very difficult,'' he replied. `` There's no question that the people that are holding the hostages have some kind of allegiance or connection with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. I think it would be very difficult for us to justify anything unless they released the hostages.'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said Iranian officials would have to explain why the hostages remain in captivity. `` I mean, what are they holding these people for, that have nothing to do with the policies they do n't like?'' the ambassador said. `` These people are college professors and doctors and librarians, and what have they got to do with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government policies that the Iranians do n't like? It's a totally illogical and rather cowardly thing to hold those hostages.'' `` I think the whole fact that they seized our embassy and held 150 people there hostage for a year, they've probably destroyed the embassy or seriously damaged it,'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said. He said there would have to be arrangements about `` where we'd go'' and a whole lot of other complicated logistical arrangements <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials hope that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acceptance of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ceasefire resolution `` will lead to an improving relationship and circumstances where we might be able to have a dialogue.'' `` But that does not diminish the fact that we will only have a dialogue with authoritative representatives of the government,'' the spokesman said, `` and that has not occurred.'' The White House often has said that it was doing all it could to win the release of nine Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian elements, and recent developments have prompted new speculation about a possible hostage release. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made only a terse statement in response to a reporter's question Monday as the president concluded a Rose Garden ceremony honoring youths selected for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> political studies program The president has steadfastly defended his administration's clandestine sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to the revolutionary government of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> in 1985-86 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has offered conflicting accounts of whether the sales amounted to an arms-for-hostages deal. Two hostages, the Rev. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, were released during the time of the transfers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Money from the arms sales eventually was diverted to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, leading to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's worst scandal. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not elaborate on his terse statement of Monday. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that `` our position remains the same, that we're always available to talk any time, any place about the safety or the release of the hostages but we will not negotiate for them and we do n't anticipate any negotiations.'' An administration official noted earlier Monday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had sent a new message to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> last week asking about the possibility of talks aimed at normalizing relations. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> still has not sent an `` authorized'' reply, the official said. The official, who asked not to be identified, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would like to talk to the Iranians about ending the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, the nine Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and terrorism. But he said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> message did not specify conditions for a resumption of relations, which were severed in 1980.

<HEAD>Doctors Issue Special Appeal To American Indians For Marrow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Doctors are asking American Indians to consider donating bone marrow for a transplant to save the life of a 4-year-old Indian girl suffering from a rare form of leukemia. The appeal to potential Indian donors for <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Geshick </PERSON> was made because heredity factors make this the best approach, doctors said Monday. Without the transplant, the girl will probably die within six months, said Dr. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlave </PERSON>, director of the Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Program at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. If she gets the transplant, her chances of surviving are 1 in 3, <PERSON> McGlave </PERSON> said during a news briefing at the American Indian Center. <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>'s four siblings and her biological parents do not have compatible bone marrow, and a search of the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry found no match among the 18,000 registered donors, said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroncek </PERSON>, medical director of the registry. Most of those registered are Caucasian. <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, who lives with her foster parents, was diagnosed as having a rare form of blood cancer _ chronic myelogenous leukemia _ when she was 8 months old. She received intensive chemotherapy and her disease went into remission for about three years, but she became ill again last April. `` All of my people, please get out and help this little girl,'' said her foster mother, <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruehl </PERSON>, who is a Chippewa Indian. If 1,000 American Indian volunteers can be tested, two or three may be found with bone marrow that matches <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Stroncek </PERSON> said.

 The former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division said today he had told <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in resigning that he thought the attorney general had probably committed felonies in doing favors for his long-time friend, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> `` I advised Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on the day I resigned,'' said former Asssistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had `` certainly'' violated the federal law barring the giving of gratuities to publich officials in exchange for official acts and that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` probably had violated the statute as well.'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said that as a lesser <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official he had won convictions of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> building inspectors and a congressman with less evidence on the same charge. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> listed for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> 63 items of fact concerning the attorney general's relationship with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> which <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said bolstered his contention that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had violated ethics regulations and probably had violated the gratuities statute. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> questioned <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s actions in assisting the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil pipeline project and regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies. Another top aide, who resigned with <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, told the committee he had quit because the department's morale and performance were deteriorating due to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal problems. That aide, former Deputy Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, testified that, `` from my vantage point, I could see that performance by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> was being impeded by a deep malaise that was setting in by virtue of Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s problems and the public outcry for his resignation.'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> told the committee that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had certainly violated federal ethics guidelines prohibiting public officials from committing acts which give any appearance of impropriety. `` Because I had concluded that Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s conduct over the years had given the appearance of partiality to Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, and constituted the use of Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s public office for Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s private gain, I would have resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> when I did irrespective of whether I had felt Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s conduct also infringed the provisions of the gratuity statute `` A possible defense against a gratuity charge being applied to Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is that all of the things of value he received from Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> were done in the name of friendship, and had no relation to any of the official acts performed by Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> which benefited Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said. `` My conclusion was that there were simply too many official acts performed by Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to benefit Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, and too many things of value conferred by Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> on Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, for a prosecutor to conclude as a matter of fact or law that the gratuity provisions ... would not apply.'' `` Not only did Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> perform many official acts for the benefit of Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, but his efforts in that regard were unusual, in the case of'' <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, the oil pipeline and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision, following a receipt of a memo from <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, on behalf of the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies `` In return, Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> appears to have become, over time, the financial ` Johnny-on-the-spot' for Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. According to <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> as well as an 814-page report by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, some of the items of value which were provided to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> by <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> included legal services for which <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> did not charge <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, arranging to provide <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> with the services of financial manager <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> and helping arrange a $ 40,000-a-year job for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said that he had outlined his views of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s culpability to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as well as congressional leaders and other White House aides. `` It is well-documented that Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> enjoyed unparalleled access to Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and saw him frequently throughout the time Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was in the White House and at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said. `` I concluded that if Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> were an ordinary public official he would be prosecuted under the gratuity law. When I was the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, we successfully prosecuted building inspectors who accepted gifts from friends who maintained they merely wanted to ` get in good' or ` say thanks' or ` expedite' an otherwise lawful official action. `` And when I was head of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, I reviewed and approved the indictment of a sitting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressman who took an action to benefit a company in his district and received two free trips to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> from a business and social acquaintance who had an interest in the company. The congressman was indicted and convicted of a violation of the gratuity provisions. The federal gratuity law is a felony punishable by up to two years in prision. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> came to the conclusion that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had not violated the gratuity statute based largely on the conclusion that the things of value that passed between <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> were done in the name of friendship. Testifying before <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` was recused in a number of matters and recusals multiplied by virtue of his being defended by a law firm which had many matters in the Department of Justice. This, coupled with the devotion of enormous amounts of department time and resources to Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s defense, adversely affected morale and performance.'' In addition, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> testified, there have been a number of cases where other department employees, ranging from senior officials to line personnel, were placed with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s approval on administrative leave while serious allegations of misconduct against them were under investigation. `` I was confronted with the argument that it was wrong for us to place an employee on administrative leave where allegations were not as serious as those facing Attorney General <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and that the same standard should apply, that the attorney general should be measured by the same standard as any other department employee and, if there were a difference in the standard, the one applying to the attorney general should be more stringent,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. `` I had no answer to this argument,'' he said. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said that he held discussions with <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and others in the department, had discussions with White House counsel A.B. <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> and White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, and that `` I decided that I had to leave.'' `` It became clear as a bell to me that I could no longer bear silent witness to the deterioration of morale, the paralysis and performance setting in in the department and the continuing erosion of public confidence in the department,'' he said. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said he was prohibited by the 1978 Ethics in Government Act from discussing his concerns directly with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> during the criminal investigation of the attorney general. `` There was only one way I could make a statement that something was wrong,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. `` I chose it. I resigned.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on Monday attacked <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, saying they failed to conduct a `` competent and thorough'' departmental inquiry of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in the spring of 1987, resulting in the criminal probe by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> recently concluded that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` probably'' broke criminal laws on four occasions, but the independent counsel did not seek an indictment. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has announced he will resign, probably by mid-August, claiming he is `` completely vindicated.'' In a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> declared that `` the evidence now shows that if a competent and thorough preliminary investigation had been directed by the then-deputy attorney general and the former head of the criminal division, there would likely have been no cause for referral to an independent counsel.'' The attorney general did not refer to <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> by name. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said the decision to launch a criminal investigation of him was based on `` hearsay'' from executives of the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> who had pleaded guilty to felony charges.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today proposed rewriting conflict-of-interest rules that govern federal employees to cover a wider variety of misconduct and said members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> no longer should be exempt from the provisions. `` Those who take on the people's trust must hold themselves to an exacting code of conduct. We can expect, and indeed, tolerate nothing less from the people who work for the government,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the all-but-certain Republican nominee, discussed the subject of ethics and standards of conduct in a speech to a gathering of congressional interns at the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. It comes on the heels of Democrats' charges of `` sleaze'' in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that in his many years of government he has been `` guided by a moral compass of decency, integrity, fairness and public purpose.'' He said his philosophy is `` it's a privilege to serve, it's an honor to hold the public trust and it's a disgrace to violate it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that as president he would establish an office of senior counselor to the president whose first responsibility would be ethics. He said the counselor would be in charge of a White House ethics office that would complement the work of the existing Office of Government Ethics. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> complained that the present system of federal ethics law `` is a confused quiltwork of executive policy statements, administrative regulations, criminal laws. Indeed, virtually every agency of government issues its own set of standards of conduct.'' He said that under his administration the code of conduct would be clear, uniform and reflect common sense. `` Nothing will be overly technical. What is intuitively right _ what your conscience tells you _ will invariably be the written rule,'' he said. He said the standards he would prescribe would eliminate `` needless restrictions'' to avoid discouraging good people from serving in government. `` The sanctions imposed by law for breach of the standards of conduct must be fair and proportionate,'' the vice president said. `` Today there is little or no room under the conflicts law for the exercise of discretion and the fashioning of a measured response. `` To put it in high relief, one is either charged with a felony or nothing at all,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` This is plainly unacceptable.'' He said prosecutors should be free to exercise their judgment to pursue civil remedies as well as enhance criminal sanctions. `` A wider variety of misconduct will consequently be reached, with fair and proportionate responses for all,'' he said. He said the conflict-of-interest statutes must cover members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` To exempt <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from any of these rules, as does current conflict-of-interest law, is to establish a double standard that breeds suspicion, breeds cynicism and in my judgment breeds abuse,'' he said. In a break with the current administration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I whole-heartedly endorse the concept of an independent counsel,'' but again said that the independent counsel law should apply to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as well. More than 100 administration officials have been accused of wrongdoing during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term, including some of his closest advisers, such as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>, convicted of three counts of perjury, and <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, convicted of three charges that he illegally lobbied the executive branch for private clients. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech has been long in the making, but was delayed until the release of a report on the investigation of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who found that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> probably broke two tax laws and twice violated a criminal conflict-of-interest statute. However, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> decided not to prosecute <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who is resigning. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, talking with reporters on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> II over the weekend, said the Democrats are `` going to try to run against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Sex Charges Against Teacher Prompt Changes At School For Deaf and
Blind</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The only state-supported school in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for the deaf and blind has tightened its hiring procedures as a result of sex charges brought by male students against a former dormitory teacher. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for the Deaf and <PERSON> Blind </PERSON>, whose alumni include musician <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, now requires six, instead of three, references from prospective employees and includes more questions on job applications about contact with children. In addition, non-teaching staffers must undergo fingerprint and criminal background checks. All new <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> teachers, including those at the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Augustine </LOCATION> school, must already undergo such checks to be certified. Dormitory teacher <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, 22, was fired in April when he was charged with sexually molesting 17 of the boys he was entrusted to protect. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, hired in 1985, pleaded innocent and is being held without bail in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> pending a September trial. His accusers include 19 deaf boys aged 9 to 14 who are students at the school founded in 1885. Most of the 550 students at the school are deaf and live on campus. `` There has been an enormous shock because the individual alleged to have done this is a person -LRB- who -RRB- had earned the trust of many kids, parents,'' Principal <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> said in an interview published in Monday's editions of The <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. As a dormitory teacher, <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> looked after the boys and taught them how to dress, clean and study. He also supervised them in games. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> is the fifth school employee since 1986 to be arrested and fired on charges involving students at the school. In separate, unrelated cases, a classroom teacher and three dormitory staffers pleaded no contest to charges including child abuse, attempted lewd and lascivious assault, or solicitation of sexual activity by someone in a custodial position. School administrators have hired a psychologist as a consultant and are offering counseling to the students and their families.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> struck back at the Democrats today, saying their criticism of his administration has gotten `` my Irish up.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, faced with Democratic charges of administration `` sleaze,'' criticized laws that he said mean officials are `` charged with a felony or nothing at all.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, was facing heat at home over budget-line veto decisions in his role as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the expected <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee to succeed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said recently he expects the Democrats are `` going to try to run against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>,'' a reference to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who faced a conflict-of-interest investigation but was not charged. But Bushf-interest rules that govern federal employees to cover a wider variety of misconduct and said members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> no longer should be exempt. In his administration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, the code of conduct would be clear and would reflect common sense. `` Nothing will be overly technical. What is intuitively right _ what your conscience tells you _ will invariably be the written rule,'' he said. `` Today there is little or no room under the conflicts law for the exercise of discretion and the fashioning of a measured response,'' he added. `` To put it in high relief, one is either charged with a felony or nothing at all. This is plainly unacceptable.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, at the outset of a White House meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders today, lambasted the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` To hear the opposition talk, you would think growth in our economy had come to a dead halt,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, adding that criticism emanating from the Democratic Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> got `` my Irish up.'' `` The opposition talks about growth. We deliver,'' he said. `` The opposition talks about jobs, we deliver.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, reading his statement to reporters, said, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will cut taxes again. What will their nominee do? I mean, what will he really do?'' The president said he will be an active participant in the fall campaign. He gave his own version of a campaign line associated with the late President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>: `` I'm going to give the opposition the truth, and they'll think it's hell.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was consulting with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders on his threat to veto legislation requiring companies to give workers 60 days' notice of plant closings and layoffs. The Democrats have made the plant-closing measure a campaign issue. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, carrying out his duties as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor while campaigning as the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee for president, was spending most of today at his Statehouse office. He faces legislative unrest over some of the $ 138 million in spending he vetoed from the state's fiscal 1989 budget. But he was upbeat Monday afternoon after a meeting between the administration's top budget officer and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Keverian </PERSON>, declaring `` all is well.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned to break for a law-and-order appearance in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, visiting a new police post at a downtown subway stop to swear in six new members of the state transit police. He met for an hour Monday with Hungarian Prime Minister <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> before the communist leader headed to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to meet President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, returned to his duties as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today as the panel began writing a bill to correct errors and make changes in the 1986 tax overhaul. Discussing today's White House meeting on plant closings, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> probably would veto the bill but no final decision had been made. The administration's stand on the issue has been repeatedly assailed by Democrats, who say employers owe it to workers to tell them when they are about to lose their jobs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says business should have the `` flexibility'' to close plants and lay off workers without the 60 days' notice. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, certain to win his party's nomination at the Republican Convention next month, has stated sentiments similar to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s on the issue. There have been reports, however, that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign would prefer to see the president let the bill become law to ease the political heat on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s dual campaigns for vice president and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have caused a temporary setback for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. Some $ 46 million in public money for the campaign is being held up because of a complaint from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> planned to begin reviewing the issue today. The Republican complaint says any money <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spends on his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> re-election bid in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> will directly benefit the Democrats' presidential ticket and give it an unfair advantage. An unusual <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law permits <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to seek both offices simultaneously.

The four are members of the anti-nuclear group Plowshares founded by <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON>. The group claims the missiles are outlawed by international law, and that their actions to symbolically disarm the weapons were not illegal because they had no criminal intent. Sister <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON> received a two-year suspended sentence and was placed on probation on the condition she not enter a military establishment. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> received a 4-month sentence and <PERSON> Boertje </PERSON> a 6-month term.

 Thunderstorms rumbled over much of the nation today, bringing rain to drought-parched land, after severe storms belted the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and South with tornadoes, lightning, hail and fierce winds that killed two people. A cold front hammered violent storms through the central <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Monday, producing severe weather in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, a late evening thunderstorm whipped up high winds that caused widespread damage around Pine Bluff. One person was killed when a tree was blown onto an occupied car. In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, lightning struck and killed a <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> woman as thunderstorms packing winds up to 60 mph raced across the state's southeastern <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, knocking out power to thousands. Two tornadoes ripped through southeastern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Monday afternoon and a third touched down a few hours later, uprooting trees and damaging crops near the eastern town of <LOCATION> Lapeer </LOCATION>. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, thunderstorms unleashed winds that downed large trees near Alma, <LOCATION> Saginaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lapeer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and hail up to an inch in diameter. The storm knocked out power to 20,288 <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> customers in the southern <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>; power was restored this morning to all but 5,480 customers, company spokesman <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Farr </PERSON>.

In <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, thunderstorms generated high winds that downed trees near <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Girardeau </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON>. Thunderstorms developing along the same cold front produced severe weather at a few places in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, farmers hoping for a little rain instead saw crops battered by damaging hail as storms moved across the state, stripping leaves off plants and causing spotty power outages from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. More than 2 inches of rain fell at <LOCATION> Cooksville </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, while more than 1.5 inches fell in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is expected to make an unprecedented visit to a Soviet air base near <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and naval facilities on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> during a visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> beginning next week, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official said today. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is scheduled to leave <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday, rest in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, arrive in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Monday, and travel to <LOCATION> Sevastapol </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION> before heading for <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> next Thursday, said the official. While in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is expected to visit the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Kubinka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> about 30 miles west of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> capital, and a base housing the <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> division, an element of Soviet ground forces. He is expected to fly to <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The official, who spoke on condition that he not be further identified, expressed chagrin that the Soviets have not notified <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> of his exact itinerary. He said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> would not accept Soviet offers to negotiate arms control agreements through the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> frequently tries to engage various parties in government and out of government as surrogate negotiators in the arms control area ... We are there in the capacity of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. We are not there to negotiate arms control agreements ... or to play these kind of games,'' said the official. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is the latest in a series of military talks that began during the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last December. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> met with his Soviet counterpart, Gen. <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Switzlerland </LOCATION> last March and in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in June. At the beginning of July, Soviet military Chief of Staff Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> took a tour of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities that included a cruise aboard the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theodore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> to watch flight operations and a look inside a B-1 bomber and Minuteman missile training facility. In return, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials let it be known that they wanted to see the Soviet Blackjack bomber and visit Soviet ships at sea. But so far, they have not received confirmation. `` Our formal agenda has not been agreed to yet,'' said the official. `` ... we let <PERSON> Marshal </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> know in detail what was going to happen.''

 The top Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> made a public appeal today for <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the new Democratic vice presidential nominee, to continue to vote for aid to the Nicaraguan Contras despite the opposition of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` We believe we ought to have that vote,'' Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> told reporters. `` He voted consistently in support in the past.'' `` My guess is there will be a lot of criticism of Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> if he abstains or does n't vote on the Contra aid package,'' he said. `` He has stood for that and been part of the bipartisan coalition and to suddenly opt out now would be very strange.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has supported President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s requests for aid to the Contra rebels in the past. A forthcoming vote that is expected in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be his first opportunity to cast a vote on the issue since becoming the running-mate of Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who opposes Contra aid. <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> commented after a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders with the president at the White House. He said the Contra issue was discussed and `` there was a general consensus that the legislation ought to proceed.'' He said there was no discussion of figures. `` We believe there ought to be military assistance,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. `` We believe those funds will bring about some credibility in negotiations.'' `` Without there being humanitarian assistance, at least with some military on the way if it does n't work out, the thing really wo n't accomplish what we want,'' he said.

<HEAD>Error-Correcting Bill Wins Committee OK</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today approved a bill of several hundred pages designed to correct errors in the 1986 tax overhaul. Attached to the bill, which won unanimous approval, was a provision exempting farmers from paying the federal tax on diesel fuel they buy for off-road use. A 1987 change requires them to pay the tax of 15.1 cents a gallon and then apply for a refund at yearend. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the committee, said the `` technical corrections'' bill is too important to clutter with other amendments that might delay its enactment. But he said committee staff will attempt to put together a package of unrelated tax amendments that would be added to the bill when it reaches the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, if a majority of committee members can agree. That presumably would include, for example, an amendment allowing free-lance writers and artists to deduct certain expenses even before a book or painting begins producing revenue. Another likely amendment would free owners of mutual fund shares from paying a tax on certain operating expenses of the fund. Those provisions and numerous others were added to the technical-corections bill by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, as were selected tax increases targeted to pay for the tax benefits. The House bill, for example, would impose a tax of $ 2.67 a pound on pipe tobacco and bar moonlighters and others who work out of their homes from deducting any part of their base monthly telephone bill.

 West Germans increasingly are snubbing their traditional wurst and potatoes for vegetables. Vegetable consumption climbed from 152 pounds per person in 1982 to 170 pounds last year and is expected to continue to increase, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for German Agriculture. West German officials are among those lining up for plates of leafy greens and vegetables. There's a new daily salad buffet available at the commissary for employees at the office of Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. Vegetable dishes have also become a favorite at the cafeteria for federal lawmakers, even though the traditional breaded cutlet, sausages and ham sandwiches still are popular. The environmentalist <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led the charge in altering the menu at federal government cafeterias to include vegetarian dishes. Chefs at <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s personal kitchen say the chancellor sometimes orders food from the commissary available to his employees, but they refuse to say whether the portly politician is among those who make a beeline for the salad buffet.

The article in <PERSON> L'Osservatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> reaffirmed the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s opposition to promoting the use of condoms in the fight against acquired immune deficiency syndrome, declaring that, as with smoking, the best medical advice is abstinence The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> commentary said the theory of not striking at the roots of evil but only its consequences has resulted in the promotion of condoms as the `` routine remedy'' of dealing with what is presented as `` the evil of the century.'' In a major statement in March, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> newspaper said the issue of sexual permissiveness was the `` true cause'' of the AIDS problem. The latest commentary said the TV spots fit into the logic that `` the essential issue is not to prevent the evil but to control its effects.'' The spots, contracted by the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, begin Tuesday on <ORGANIZATION> RAI-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s three channels and run through Aug. 8, and then again in mid-September.

<HEAD>Israeli Delegation To Moscow, First Visit in 21 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A team of Israeli diplomats, including a former Soviet dissident, left Tuesday for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in a visit seen here as critically important to <LOCATION> Soviet-Israeli </LOCATION> relations, which were severed 21 years ago. The five delegates plan to join in <LOCATION> Sabbath </LOCATION> prayers at the main synagogue on Friday evening in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and to make themselves highly visible among Soviet Jews, many of whom have been choosing to emigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> instead of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who met Tuesday with visiting Russian Orthodox Metropolitan Filaret, said he hoped for a substantial improvement in <LOCATION> Soviet-Israeli </LOCATION> relations. The visit will be especially emotional for two of the Israelis. Delegation head <PERSON> Meron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> emigrated from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at the age of 10, and <PERSON> Yaakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Kedmi </PERSON>, 43, is a former Soviet Jewish dissident who came here at the age of 24. `` We are both very moved,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, 41, said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. `` When we left there, we were young. I do n't think either of us ever thought we could return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ certainly not as official representatives of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Yeshayahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Anug </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, spent the last year heading efforts aimed at gaining Soviet permission for the official Israeli visit. He called it a `` major event'' and added `` the atmosphere is promising ... but we do n't intend to conquer the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in one day.'' He said the immediate purpose of the delegation was to help process Israeli visas both for Soviets wishing to emigrate and those wishing to visit. From January to June, 6,017 Soviet Jews emigrated and 840 of those went to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, according to the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> Intergovermental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Migration </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, the team will inspect the empty <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> building, for which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> pays about $ 100,000 annual rent. <PERSON> Anug </PERSON> said the delegation's limited mandate could be expanded, although there was no plan for it to take part in political talks with Soviet officials. The diplomats traveled Tuesday to <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, where they are to pick up two-month Soviet visas and then leave Thursday for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> hopes the delegates will be allowed to stay longer. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> severed ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the 1967 Middle East War to protest <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of territory captured from three Arab countries. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> still have no official diplomatic relations, but links between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> have recently improved. In the summer of 1986, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and Soviet delegates met in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, for the first official session since 1967. Last summer, a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation arrived in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> on two-month visas that since have been extended.

<HEAD>Hunting May Be Limited for Drought-Stricken Ducks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drought has reduced the expected fall duck migration to the second smallest on record and could mean a 25 percent reduction in hunting this year, federal wildlife officials say. The migration will total about 66 million ducks, according to biologists of the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Only 1985's estimated migration of 62 million was lower, and last year's was a hopeful 74 million. All the decline will come in the Central and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> flyways because of steady loss of marshy breeding areas in the northern plains states and southern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in the 1980s. The flight on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> flyways should be unchanged from last year. The service has been warning for weeks that major new restrictions probably will be needed for hunting seasons starting in October. States are in charge of actual hunting regulations, but they must choose from possibilities set out by the service. Early-season guidelines for hunting the blue-winged teal in September call for no season at all in 13 Central and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> flyway states. Regular-season guidelines will be decided upon next week after a public hearing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Advisory committees meeting in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> on Monday were asked to discuss a 25 percent cutback in the number of days during which duck hunting is allowed, a reduction in bag limits from the typical four to three and an early closing of the season on Jan. 1 instead of Jan. 20, said <PERSON> Megan </PERSON> <PERSON> Durham </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. It is n't just this year's drought that has reduced breeding activity in the marshes. There have been many dry years in this decade, allowing farming to be extended into areas previously too wet for crops, particularly in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Surveys released last week showed record numbers of ducks in northern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, with populations up 9 percent there. Those ducks could n't find suitable areas farther south, and the longer flights may have tired them too much to breed, biologists fear. Overall, the census by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian biologists showed the breeding populations of 10 major species down 3.7 percent from last year and 17 percent from the 1955-1987 average. There were only 2.58 million Northern pintail ducks, 18 percent fewer than last year and 54 percent below average. Mallards in southern <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION> fell below 1 million for the first time. `` Biologists are beginning to worry that continued low water conditions in the areas waterfowl use for migration stopovers and wintering will concentrate the birds and make them more vulnerable to disease later this year,'' the service said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON>, director of the service, was quoted as expecting increased emphasis on management of wetlands for waterfowl as provided for under the 1986 `` North American Plan'' agreement with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, because such areas in many cases have provided the only relief for drought-stressed waterfowl. Some other findings from the survey: _ The <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> has been turned into a `` river of sand,'' exposing the nesting piping plover and the interior least tern to threats of predators and death of aquatic food species _ Geese are faring better than ducks, since they nest on more permanent wetlands and are better able to protect their young from predators _ Flows of tributaries to the Great Lakes are so low biologists can not safely apply chemicals to control lamprey, which prey on lake trout Dredging necessitated by low water will spread contaminated bottom sediment, threatening other aquatic life. _ The acorn crop from oak trees in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and South could be a near-total failure without major rain soon, spelling problems for deer, squirrels and wild turkeys dependent on acorns for food _ Pheasant, quail and grouse, though doing well in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> now, could be hurt next winter and spring through drought-caused loss of food and cover Poor production of pheasant, grouse and Hungarian partridge is expected in the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>. _ Some fish wo n't spawn in the upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> rivers because of low water, and high temperatures in the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> has eliminated or reduced production of walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass and largemouth bass at federal hatcheries

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's top <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> official will meet next week with his Soviet counterpart to discuss developments in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and the stalled <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace process, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Tuesday. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> will meet in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> early next week with <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON>, a specialist on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> at the Soviet foreign ministry, said the official. He spoke on condition of anonymity. The Murphy-Polyakov meeting is part of regularly scheduled contacts between the two officials, although they have increased the pace of their meetings this year, said the official. They last met in March. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> will travel to the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> meeting, said another official. He declined to elaborate or to be named. <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace moves have been moribund since attempts earlier this year by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to bring the sides to the negotiating table and defuse the Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupied territories. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> appears to have placed its peace plan on hold, pending the outcome of general elections in both countries in November. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is seeking an increased role in the peace process, which so far has been dominated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In the Gulf, the superpowers are cooperating in supporting attempts by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to bring about a cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The two neighbors, who have been at war for almost eight years, agreed last week to accept a year-old <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution designed to end the conflict. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> is meeting this week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with representatives from both sides to work out implementation of the cease-fire. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> are also expected to discuss implementation of the cease-fire, as well as rehabilitation plans for the devastated region. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has offered to provide financial help for rehabilitation projects. The Soviets enjoy good ties with both parties, while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is seeking to renew the dialogue it had with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> before ties were broken following the 1979 take-over of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> by Iranian militants.

Parliament held a special session in honor of the 81-year-old monarch, and a portrait of the prince etched onto <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION> marble was unveiled in the government building in the capital, <LOCATION> Vaduz </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> is the second-longest ruling head of state in the world, behind <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, 87, who has reigned for 62 years. He oversees a 62-square-mile principality with a homogeneous population of 27,000. Four years ago, <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> turned over administrative duties to his eldest son, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>, and since then his role largely has been ceremonial. Under <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Josef </PERSON>'s rule, <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION> moved from being a poor agrarian state to a modern industrial nation. The prince also is credited with resolving internal political unrest before World War II and with keeping the principality, nestled between <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, neutral during the war.

The talks had been set for Wednesday. Further talks with <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and his Iraqi counterpart, <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, are to be held Wednesday. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> was scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> later today. It was not known if he would see the secretary-general today. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> was aided by senior political, military and legal officers. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Monday he is optimistic a truce date can be set within 10 days. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced July 18 that it accepted the year-old <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a cease-fire in the nearly 8-year-old war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> previously accepted the resolution. Since Friday, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has captured Iranian territory and prisoners in a series of attacks but has said it did not intend to keep the land. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has said it intended to take the prisoners to improve its bargaining position in cease-fire talks. `` They have intensified the war on the front ... in the last few hours they have attacked some cities and invaded our border,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said today. He said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> officials declared Monday that their forces would withdraw from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by midnight. However, he said, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded two northwestern cities `` and still the war is going on very seriously and they have used chemical weapons on a large scale.'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> declined to answer reporters' questions about the possibility of restoring a dialogue with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said today it would be `` very difficult'' for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to normalize relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> before the nine <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages were freed from captivity in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` There's no question that the people that are holding the hostages have some kind of allegiance or connection with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` This Morning.'' `` I think it would be very dfficult for us to justify anything unless they released the hostages,'' he said. The longest-held among the 18 foreign hostages believed held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> on Monday reaffirmed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> willingness to hold a dialogue with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. He told reporters the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> a message last week raising the possibility of talks, but no reply had yet been received. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> broke diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> after Iranian revolutionaries stormed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> there in 1980 and took hostages. The last 52 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were freed 444 days later. A seven-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team, meanwhile, arrived in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> today to work out the technical details of the cease-fire and was to visit <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> later in the week. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team leader Lt.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today side-stepped a controversial pension issue during debate on the fiscal 1989 health and human services spending bill, after having rejected attempts to terminate the nation's family planning program. The massive $ 137 billion bill, which also contains money for the departments of labor and education, is traditionally a lightning rod for controversy. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said he would veto the entire bill based on a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> provision permitting Medicaid funds for abortions where pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. Current law permits payments only where the life of the mother is endangered. Senators agreed today to leave out another provision opposed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a one-year moratorium on companies cashing out overfunded pension plans. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had approved the moratorium, but the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> instead passed a resolution directing the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to deal with the issue. Hundreds of companies have dipped into their plans and labor leaders say the money is often used for mergers or other business moves not in workers' interests. `` Company after company has turned its pension plan into a piggybank'' while paying meager benefits to retirees, said Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, chief sponsor of the provision. Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., a leading opponent of the moratorium, said the <ORGANIZATION> Metzenbaum </ORGANIZATION> approach would have encouraged companies to underfund their plans He also said the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had no expertise in the complicated area of pension law. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, lost attempts Monday to eliminate the $ 140 million Title X family planning program and to require unmarried minors seeking contraceptives from federally funded clinics to have written parental consent. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 65-21 against getting rid of Title X and 54-34 against the mandatory parental consent proposal. In other action Monday on the labor-HHS spending bill, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved by voice vote an abortion `` conscience clause'' sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, R-N. The provision says none of the money in the bill can be used to require any person or entity to perform or facilitate abortions. It applies to medical personnel or denominational hospitals with religious or moral objections to abortion. Title X provides money to states, local health departments and private groups for family planning clinics serving primarily low-income women. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> alleged that Title X recipients are using federal funds for abortion-related services and for `` secret sex programs for our nation's teen-agers.'' `` The federal government takes money from American parents and then uses that money to give contraceptives ... to their children,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. `` This is wrong. This is immoral.'' Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, R-Conn., countered that `` Title X is not an abortion program It's a knowledge program. It has been enormously successful.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday stripped away all issues of controversy and unanimously approved a bill correcting hundreds of errors in the 1986 tax overhaul law. The chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, won quick approval of the bill by promising colleagues that the committee staff would attempt to put together a separate package of their favorite unrelated tax provisions. If such a package could win approval of a majority of the panel, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, it could be offered as an amendment when the bill reaches the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, perhaps in September. That package likely would include amendments to permanently free about 20 million mutual fund shareholders from a tax on certain fund operating expenses and to allow free-lance writers and artists to deduct expenses before a book or painting starts producing income. Most of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s bill is designed to correct mistakes in the 1986 law, but there is a new provision which would exempt farmers and some other diesel users from paying tax on fuel used for off-road purposes. A 1987 law requires that such users pay the tax of 15.1 cents a gallon and apply for a refund at year-end. `` This is the last major piece of legislation we expect to come out of this committee this year,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the running mate of Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He cautioned that many tax incentives that members want to add to the bill can not be accepted because of budget constraints. While members of the committee probably would have no trouble agreeing on some relatively small selective tax increases, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, the problem would come in deciding which of many pet tax incentives would go into the final bill. `` Unless we follow what you suggest,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the committee, `` we will have no bill at all.'' The committee's action left in doubt the fate of several major provisions that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> added to its own version of the `` technical corrections'' bill. These include tax credits for business research and experimentation, for owners of low-income rental housing and for employers that hire the poor, as well as a tax exemption for bonds used to help low-income families buy their first home. The Ways and <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also approved several tax increases to pay for those and other incentives. Those provisions range from a new tax of $ 2.67 on a pound of pipe tobacco to a reduction in tax benefits for single-premium life insurance policies. `` There is a whole litany of things we would like to do but were are not going to be able to get them in'' this bill, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. Accountants and tax lawyers are especially eager to have the technical-corrections bill enacted because many provisions in the massive 1986 law are unclear or ambiguous.

 A federal judge today ordered state Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s extortion trial moved from <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> to Mobile after <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s attorneys complained that pre-trial publicity made a fair trial impossible. The veteran Tuskegee lawmaker is also president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>.

The six week delay is to allow one of <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s defense attorneys, former Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxley </PERSON>, to recover from a bleeding ulcer. In a court hearing today, <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION>'s defense team presented two television reporters who testified about the extensive coverage <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s case received on their Montgomery stations. A private investigator working for <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s lawyers said he had interviewed more than 300 people in central and south <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> about the <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> case and at least 90 percent were convinced <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> was guilty. Private investigator <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the least opinionated people he found in his survey were in the Mobile area. After listening to the testimony <PERSON> Dubina </PERSON> agreed to move the trial. `` I think that's some indication the judge agrees Mr. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> has been mistreated, or treated differently,'' <PERSON> Baxley </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> first rose to prominence in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> by commanding an army company that shot and killed 22 protesting students in a 1962 riot at <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Last March, when thousands of students went on a rampage in some of the worst rioting in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s history, it again was <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> who led the forces that put them down. Analysts had suggested the 64-year-old hardliner would be a logical scapegoat as the government of Ne Win, his close ally, sought to appease critics and stabilize the country. Instead, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> emerged Tuesday as <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s most powerful leader, succeeding <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, who resigned Saturday. The new chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ virtually the country's sole political institution _ is like almost all of its members a retired military officer. He joined the army in 1942 when <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> officers, including Ne Win, were siding with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> against the Allies _ specifically <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which had colonized the onetime kingdom. As the war progressed, the officers switched allegiance to the Allies, realizing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> posed as much a threat to <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> independence as had the British. Independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1948 was followed by a chaotic, 14-year experiment with democracy. That experiment ended in 1962, the year Ne Win seized power in a military coup and began to enforce his brand of economic socialism, military-backed authoritarian rule and isolation from much of the world. That same year, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> led his army unit in quelling the protest at <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, firmly establishing his reputation as an unbending leader prepared to wield an iron fist to root out opposition. Little has been pubished about <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> and others in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s senior hierarchy, most of whom live secluded lives away from the public eye <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> retired from the army and in 1977 became a member of the party's guiding body, the Central Executive Committee. He took the No. 4 party slot of joint general secretary in 1985. Also in 1985, he was named secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 3 position in the government after president and vice president. The 28-member council directs all state organs. He has also held ministerial portfolios for cooperatives, transport, communications, and home affairs. On March 18, in a day that was later dubbed `` Bloody Friday,'' thousands of students stormed through downtown <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, burning cars and shouting anti-government slogans for the second time in three months. The `` Lon Htein,'' or riot police, were called out, reinforced by regular army units and armored vehicles. According to Western diplomatic and <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> sources, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> commanded the police from a tactical command headquarters at the government broadcast station. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> overruled some leaders who wanted to handle the riot more leniently, the sources said. The government has since admitted to 43 deaths but more than 100 people are believed to have been killed. Analysts, among them the respected <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>, had suggested <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> would take the fall for the violence, which deepened anti-government sentiments. Home Minister Min Goung resigned, several other officials were sacked or reprimanded. On Tuesday, the nation's prime minister and attorney general were dismissed in connection with the riots, and <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> emerged as leader.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has selected two sites in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> as the best locations for proposed government-owned facilities for the production and testing of a new space shuttle solid rocket motor, the space agency announced today. A location in northeastern <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> known as <LOCATION> Yellow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> was selected as a production site for the space shuttle advanced solid rocket motor, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said, and the <ORGANIZATION> Stennis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, has been selected as a site for the testing of the motor. <LOCATION> Yellow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> facility. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said work at the <LOCATION> Yellow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> site could provide about 1,400 new jobs, and an additional 600 jobs would be created at <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The space shuttle advanced solid rocket motor is planned to replace the current redesigned shuttle rocket motor in the mid-1990s. The advanced motor is expected to provide more reliability and safety, and enable the space shuttle to carry more cargo into orbit. Under the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> advanced rocket motor plan, the space agency will now ask for contract proposals for work on the rocket motor at the two <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> sites. Companies will be asked to make bids on building a government-owned facility that would be operated by the contractor. Companies may also propose that the work be done in facilities built and owned by contractors at a privately owned site of the contractor's choosing. After evaluating the options, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will make a final decision on the advanced solid rocket motor contract. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said that an advanced solid rocket motor program in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> will make `` maximum utilization'' of the Michoud Assembly Facility and the <ORGANIZATION> Slidell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION>, both located nearby in southeastern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Study Says Many Lower Back Disc Operations May Be Unnecessary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The spine specialist who prescribed back surgery for football star <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Montana </PERSON> says at least twice as many operations as necessary are performed for ruptured discs in the lower back. Dr. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Saal </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said surgeons generally use the wrong criteria in deciding to operate. He reported findings of his three-year study, co-written with his brother, Dr. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Saal </PERSON>, to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, on Monday. These include severe pain, leg weakness, failure to respond to bed rest and diagnostic exams showing a fragment of the disc's nucleus has broken through the disc wall and is pressing against a nerve root None of those, <PERSON> Saal </PERSON> said, should be used as overwhelming evidence that surgery is needed. Instead, the decision should be based on the patients' level of function and whether that can be improved by an active rehabilitation program, he said. `` More than 20 percent of patients with -LRB- lower back -RRB- disc problems have surgery but less than 10 percent may really need it if there are no other problems, such as stenosis, or narrowing of the spine,'' <PERSON> Saal </PERSON> said in an interview. Other studies have noted the presence of stenosis as a reason for failed lumbar disc surgery and estimated the presence of stenosis in 30 percent of those patients. Rapid, progressive weakness in the leg is an indication surgery is needed, <PERSON> Saal </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> had those symptoms, along with stenosis, before his surgery in 1986. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s back surgery was so successful, it was commonly referred to on the sports pages as a `` miracle.'' At mid-season, doctors said the surgery would sideline him for the rest of the year, possibly forever. But he was back on the field in weeks to lead the 49ers in the playoffs. Most patients with ruptured lumbar discs have less severe symptoms and can return to work and sports within four months after starting active, non-operative treatment, <PERSON> Saal </PERSON> said. `` He's probably correct,'' said <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON>, chief of neurosurgery at the <ORGANIZATION> Palo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and associate professor of surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Far too much surgery has been done on lumbar discs, and we're becoming more aware about how much it's been overdone now because we have better tools, such as magnetic resonance imaging.'' <PERSON> Saal </PERSON>'s treatment included teaching patients how to reduce the risks of further injury, training for spine stabilization and exercises to develop overall body strength and flexibility while the disc heals itself. Injections or drugs sometimes were used to block pain and reduce swelling. Such treatment, he said, can cost up to $ 3,500, compared with more than $ 30,000 for surgery and post-operative care, while involving much less risk. More than 2 million Americans suffer from ruptured discs in their necks and lower backs, and they spend more than $ 3 billion annually on lumbar disc treatment, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthopedic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgeons </ORGANIZATION>. An estimated 237,000 operations on discs in the neck and back were performed in 1986, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortara </PERSON>, neurosurgeon at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and associate professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, said he agreed that lumbar disc surgery is sometimes performed unnecessarily but was unaware of any studies indicating how often that occurs. But he was skeptical of <PERSON> Saal </PERSON>'s claim that 90 percent of lumbar disc patients could be healed without surgery if they have severe pain. `` We're quite conservative here, as a rule,'' he said. `` But if the patients have failed bed rest, physical therapy, pain medication, antispasm drugs and are out of work and ca n't do the things they like, then surgery is probably indicated.'' <PERSON> Saal </PERSON>'s study, based on 59 patients averaging 35 years old and thought to be free of stenosis, found their symptoms _ sciatic pain in their toes, legs or buttocks, a tingling sensation in their toes and weakness in their feet _ lasted an average of five months. Only six patients required surgery after the non-operative program, but four of those were found to have stenosis. Eighteen patients asked surgeons for a second opinion of their cases and all were recommended for surgery as soon as possible to avoid long term complications. Fifteen of those, however, rated themselves good or excellent after treatment without surgery.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it will build a $ 20 million plant that will process 1,250 tons of coal an hour.

The plant, which would be among the largest in the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, will provide 2 million to 3 million tons of coal a year, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said the facility could allow the company to hire more people to work in Blue Diamond's mines.

The company also plans to develop a $ 12 million longwall mining system at two new eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> mines. A longwall uses a large cutting machine that runs back and forth on a track, shearing hundreds of tons of coal off a seam as it passes. Hydraulic systems keep the track _ and temporary, metal roof supports above it _ advancing as the machine cuts into the seam. Blue Diamond will finance the projects with roughly $ 30 million it received from the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> when that utility bought itself out of a high-cost contract last year.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today approved 17 articles of impeachment against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and sent the historic bribery case to the full House. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, 51, is the first federal judge to face impeachment after his acquittal in a criminal trial on the same charges, and the first black to face removal from federal office under the impeachment procedure. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> said that those who voted against him `` acted in blind ignorance. They could not have read the material.'' The committee voted 32-1 to approve all the 17 impeachment articles. A number of committee members said they had done considerable soul searching because they feared <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> may have been correct in his assertion that he was the victim of racism. But those expressing such reservations said that factual circumstances of the case showed impeachment was warranted. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> would be removed from his lifetime office if the full House votes for impeachment and he is convicted in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trial. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> is accused of conspiring to solicit a bribe from two defendants who appeared before him and of lying about the scheme to a federal jury. He also is accused of leaking information about a wiretap. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney accused of participating with <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> in the bribery scheme, has been convicted of the charges. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, in a separate 1983 trial, was acquitted. The first of the articles of impeachment, which are similar to an indictment, accused <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of engaging in a corrupt conspiracy to obtain a $ 150,000 bribe from two brothers. Other articles accused him of lying about the scheme at his trial by denying specific parts of the conspiracy; of leaking wiretap information; and of undermining the confidence of the federal judiciary. Eleven impeachment cases have come to trial before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and five defendants, all judges, have been removed from office.

<HEAD>Screenwriter Seeks Feature Movie Role for Hometown Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. CLOUD, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A screenwriter wants his home town to be in pictures, but he has encountered some reluctant stars. Public and private school officials are concerned about the script, in which students flout authority to keep their school from closing. `` We'll be equated to whatever takes place'' in the film, said Sister <PERSON> Kevyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Maiers </PERSON>, administrator at <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where much of the filming would take place. There's another set of problems at Apollo High School, where screenwriter <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommers </PERSON> was graduated in 1976. `` The script calls for a car on the football field. Especially during the time of football season, that creates some concern,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON>, community relations specialist for St. Cloud's public school district The moviemakers would like to film two Apollo football games, but do n't want to become the main attraction themselves at the games, she said. But <PERSON> Sommers </PERSON>, writer-director of `` Catch Me If You Can,'' says the script is `` very innocent.'' `` In the end, the school principal is the hero. He's revered throughout,'' <PERSON> Sommers </PERSON> said Tuesday from his office in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, where casting is under way. <PERSON> Sommers </PERSON> would n't reveal many details about the script, but said it's generally `` about a principal who believes in kids and kids believe in him. And there's a romance about two kids from the opposite sides of the track who get together to do something positive'' to keep their school open. `` There's no sex at all. There's a big kiss at the end,'' <PERSON> Sommers </PERSON> added. About two weeks of filming in St. Cloud would begin in September, and the public and private school boards are expected to decide in the next few weeks whether to approve the project. <PERSON> Sommers </PERSON>, who also graduated from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> at </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegeville </ORGANIZATION>, said he expects approval. `` It'll be great for the school.

 When a bicyclist grabbed 80-year-old <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>'s purse as she was walking home from the grocery store, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON> raced to the rescue. So did <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>. So did three construction workers. `` This is one grateful old lady,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said, recounting the events of Monday. She said she had set her shopping bag down on a fire hydrant, put her purse inside it `` and I took about four steps when that young man came by ... just picked my purse right out, right out of the bag, and kept on going.'' Ms. <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON>, 34, was driving by when she saw the man steal the purse and she began chasing him. `` The creep,'' she said. `` I figured he could ride his bike for as long as he wanted to but I could chase him. I thought about hitting him, but I did n't do it because I knew I'd get sued.'' Price, 30, was driving behind Ms. <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON>, and he too gave chase. `` Hang on tight,'' he told his 6 - and 8-year-old daughters `` A lady's in trouble.'' Trapped in a cul-de-sac, the bicyclist ditched the purse and jumped over a fence. Mrs. <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON> returned the purse, containing $ 26 and eyeglasses, to Mrs. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>. Meanwhile, Price gunned his car around the block to catch the thief on the other side, but missed him. He asked several construction workers if they had seen a guy in a plaid shirt. <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> began looking for him, saw the man peeking around the corner of an apartment building and ran toward him. <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> also yelled to an elderly man on his front porch to call police. Two other construction workers, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON>, 18, and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Haywiser </PERSON>, 28, sprinted toward the man in the plaid shirt. `` You know anything about a purse-snatching?'' they yelled. `` I do n't want no drugs,'' the man hollered back, and he ran, with the pair right behind. Half a mile later, <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> tackled the man in a mall. `` The security guard walked up to me. He did n't know what to think. I was huffing and puffing and all I could say was ` Call the police,''' <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> said. But officers <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasty </PERSON> were already there. The elderly man and at least two other residents had been phoning details of the chase along the way. <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>, 19, was arrested and in the Orange County Jail without bond Tuesday, charged with strong-arm robbery.

 The <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, closed when inspectors discovered such extensive corrosion they feared it might collapse, was reopened Tuesday following nearly $ 10 million in surface work. `` The bridge is now stronger than it's been since World War II,'' said Transportation Commissioner <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON>, who watched the first cars roll over the span linking <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> at 7:45 a.m. The bridge was built in 1903 for bicycles and horse-drawn buggies. By the time it was closed April 12 it was carrying more than 100,000 vehicles and 420 trains daily. The closing of the bridge affected millions of daily commuters not only on that structure but on the neighboring <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> bridges, to which displaced traffic was rerouted. Two lanes for motorists were opened in May and another two in June. Tuesday's ceremony marked the opening of all eight lanes to cars. Brooklyn-bound trucks remain forbidden, but should be allowed on the bridge by mid-August, <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> said the city was able to complete the work two weeks ahead of schedule because contractors and city employees worked seven days a week, adding some 150 tons of steel to the structure. More extensive, long-term work _ particularly on the approach roadways leading to the bridge _ is still needed, <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> said. A $ 350 million, seven-year project will begin once federal and state funds are secured. Closures then will be one lane at a time, he said. `` We now know what we need to do to preserve this bridge,'' said <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON>. `` When we're done it will be like new and should last hundreds of years _ if we take care of it.''

 Contaminated rainwater in the slums of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> is blamed by city officials for an epidemic of water-borne diseases that killed 14 more lives Tuesday, bringing the death toll to 157. At least 317 people suffering from gastroenteritis and cholera were hospitalized Tuesday and that the epidemic is spreading to new areas of the Indian capital. More than 4,400 residents, mostly children, are hospitalized with the diseases, caused by contaminated water from monsoon rains that has seeped into the city's primitive pipes and wells. About 1,200 new cases were reported Monday from nine areas of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> with a combined population of half a million people. Most of the earlier cases were reported from only two neighborhoods. More than 11,700 people have sought treatment since July 9. Officials say they have inoculated more than 200,000 people to halt the spread of the diseases. Dr. <PERSON> Raj </PERSON> <PERSON> Saxena </PERSON>, a physician in the district of <PERSON> Sunder </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagri </PERSON>, says he and his team are inoculating 30 people every hour. `` But it seems it's not working,'' he said. `` Frankly speaking, the situation is out of our hands. The damage has been done, we are just trying to check it.'' Hit hardest by the epidemic are slums built after 1975 in outlying areas to the east. Of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s 8 million people, 2.4 million people live in slums, 25 percent of which have no power supply, 49 percent no tap water and 32 percent no toilet facilities. The impoverished <LOCATION> Nand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nagri </LOCATION> district, east of the <LOCATION> Yamuna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, was the first area hit by the epidemic and is worst-affected. It has 50,000 residents. Garbage in the area has not been collected for four or five months after a dispute between the <ORGANIZATION> Delhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> over which agency was responsible for the slum areas. Health officials say rain water flowing through garbage and sewage into shallow wells is spreading the diseases among the congested dwellings. Health officials ordered city wells shut off and water tanked in. Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> toured the area last week and ordered the garbage cleared. But the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported Tuesday that the slums `` still looked like cesspools.'' Dr. T.S. <PERSON> Rana </PERSON>, a private physician with a clinic in <LOCATION> Nand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nagri </LOCATION>, said the number of cases may be greater than reported. `` At least four to five people are dying of cholera from this area daily who are not reported,'' he said. `` People here do not have money to take patients to hospitals,'' he said. `` They try the local doctors and then just pray, and cholera is a disease which does not respond to prayer.'' The monsoon rains began in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> in the last week of June.

 Prairie House, the mountain retreat of the late <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, is for sale for $ 275,000. `` Part of me hopes nobody will buy it, but I just ca n't get out there enough,'' said the owner, <PERSON> Cathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, the fourth and last wife of the late jurist. Now practicing law in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and married to an insurance executive, she spent her first honeymoon at Goose Prairie in 1966 as the 23-year-old bride of <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, then 67. Title to <ORGANIZATION> Prairie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed to her when <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> died in 1980. The house came on the market during the last three to four weeks, said <PERSON> Muff </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brokers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and listing agent for the home. <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON> said she has had many inquiries and is working on one offer but has declined to speculate when she would sell the house. She noted it is in a remote area with the nearest phone 14 miles away. `` It could be frustrating if you need access to communication,'' <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON> said. The Swiss-style chalet sits in a meadow facing the snow-covered flanks of Old Scab, <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hump </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bald </LOCATION> in this hamlet east of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rainier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. The eight-acre property also includes a small barn and a tree stump bearing a plaque that reads, `` Absolutely Nothing Happened on this Spot, Sept. 6, 1859.'' `` Goose Prairie is my place in a sense that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, never could be,'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> wrote in his autobiography `` Go East, Young Man.'' Of the setting in the <LOCATION> Bumping </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION>, he wrote, `` Nursery of splendid trees. Garden of brilliant flowers. Abode of birds without number. Greenhouse for succulent mushrooms. Gateway to wild and high country.'' The house has three fireplaces. The back of the property borders the 166,000-acre <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilderness </PERSON> <PERSON> Area </PERSON>, established and named after his death. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> grew to love the area as a teen-ager in <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>, about 50 miles to the east, hiking the rugged terrain to strenthen his legs after a bout with polio. It was from his summer home in August 1970 that he ruled the bombing of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, ordered by President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, was illegal _ a finding overturned within six hours by the eight other justices in a telephone conference. Stone a time when she and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> were camped on Bismarck Peak. `` He saw these guys dressed in business suits who had hiked up to our camp. ` Tell'em I'm the wrangler,' he muttered,'' she said. After hearing what the lawyers had to say, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> told them he was headed for a still more remote camp but promised to write a legal opinion and leave it in a tree stump. `` The next day, only one of the attorneys was in shape to hike back up to camp,'' said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Kershaw </PERSON>, a neighbor who also recalled the incident. `` As promised, the opinion was waiting in the stump.

<HEAD>Fourth Fly Found; Helicopters Spray Suburban Area</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A fourth Mediterranean fruit fly was found just hours before a pair of helicopters sprayed presticide over a 16-square-mile suburban area, but officials said Tuesday they do n't plan to repeat the airborne effort The next step in efforts to eradicate the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> fruit fly, one of the most destructive crop-destroying insects, will be the release next week of about 20 million cobalt-treated sterile flies, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, chief deputy for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. After that, he said, there will be daily releases of sterile flies to prevent females that escape the poison from reproducing. The fourth Medfly was found Monday in a peach tree at a home in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Reseda </LOCATION>, a quarter-mile west of the zone treated with the pesticide malathion. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> proclaimed a state of emergency for the county last week after two female Medflies were found in traps. The proclamation was a necessary step for spraying the pesticide. A third Medfly, a male, was found Monday morning about a mile from where the two females were found July 20. The helicopters, laden with 1,100 gallons of the malathion mixed with a corn-syrup bait, began spraying the infested area at 10 p.m. Monday and finished early Tuesday. Each helicopter made three passes at 500 feet over the area, said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. `` There were no complications. It was a good, clean operation,'' he said. The Medfly, common in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and probably carried into <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on fruit brought in by tourists, has a potential for spreading rapidly. The insect is considered a major threat to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s multibillion-dollar agricultural industry In 1981, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> spent about $ 100 million to eradicate a statewide Medfly infestation that destroyed $ 100 million in crops. Meanwhile, concerned residents deluged hospitals and the county's Medfly hot line with questions about possible health hazards from the spraying. `` We've had a few _ a few thousand calls,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingfelder </PERSON>, a county agricultural inspector. Medical experts say most residents need not fear the pesticide, which has been diluted to about one ounce for every acre of land sprayed. Only people with serious respiratory ailments might be affected, doctors said. Nonetheless, officials advised residents to hose down lawns after the spraying, especially if they have pets, and to cover their cars because the spray can corrode auto paint.

 Gunmen shot and killed a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> sergeant while he was jogging with his dogs near <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, in an incident that may have been caused by a marital dispute, police said Tuesday. In a separate incident, police said the Filipino wife of an American serviceman was slain Sunday near the base, about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. In a third incident, police said two Belgian Embassy officials were shot and wounded Sunday south of the capital, and the Filipino companion of one of them was shot dead. Police said robbery appeared to be the motive in the last two cases. Tech. Sgt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmer </PERSON>, 31, of the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, was jogging near his home about one mile from the base's main gate about 9:30 p.m. Monday when gunmen in a car opened fire with M-16 rifles, killing him and his two dogs, police said. Investigators, who requested anonymity, said a preliminary investigation indicated the killing may have been caused by a marital dispute. They said <PERSON> Blackmer </PERSON> was estranged from his Filipino wife and was living with another woman. Police Monday picked up the wife, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, for questioning but said no charges were filed. Police Capt. <PERSON> Gener </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangune </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Blackmer </PERSON> refused to answer questions and expressed resentment over receiving a smaller amount of financial support than <PERSON> Blackmer </PERSON> was paying to his common-law wife. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Billa </PERSON> <PERSON> Heacox </PERSON>, 41, the wife of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heacox </PERSON>, was found stabbed to death about three miles north of <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>. Master Sgt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Mrs. <PERSON> Heacox </PERSON>'s body was found in a car after witnesses saw two Filipino men fleeing from the vehicle, which had run off the road. The woman's husband, assigned to a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> communications station in nearby <LOCATION> Tarlac </LOCATION> province, said the victim was on her way to <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> when she was killed. He said his wife's jewelry and about $ 150 were missing. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, a gunman wounded a Belgian diplomat and shot dead his Filipino companion, <PERSON> Adorata </PERSON> <PERSON> Capistrano </PERSON>, in an apparent robbery attempt Sunday near the Taal volcano, a tourist resort about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, according to a Belgian Embassy official. He said <PERSON> Benoit </PERSON> <PERSON> Standaert </PERSON>, second secretary at the embassy, suffered two gunshot wounds but was released from the hospital. Embassy spokeswoman <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanherk </PERSON> quoted police in <LOCATION> Batangas </LOCATION> province as saying that they suspected robbery was the motive because the gunman fled with Ms. <PERSON> Capistrano </PERSON>'s purse. Nearly 40 people have been killed in communities around <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> this year. Police say many of the killings were blamed on communist rebels, who have been fighting to overthrow the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government since 1969 and have threatened to attack American military personnel. <PERSON> Blackmer </PERSON> was the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> service member slain in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> since October, when the rebels killed two <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> enlisted men, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> sergeant and a Filipino civilian of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ancestry. But a Filipino investigator who requested anonymity said the style in which <PERSON> Blackmer </PERSON> was killed and the weapons used did not fit the pattern of guerrilla atacks. A base spokeswoman, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Maryellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaddick </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities had not imposed any new restrictions on the nearly 26,000 American troops, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> civilians and dependents stationed at the base.

<HEAD>Armenian Officials Condemn Activists in Territorial Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders leveled an unusually harsh attack Tuesday on activists who sought annexation of an Armenian region in a neighboring republic, indicating the activists could no longer count on high-level support. The party position, outlined in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda, came after Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gave a hardline speech rejecting the transfer of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a mostly Armenian enclave in the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, to the jurisdiction of neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Activists in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and in the disputed region itself have been pushing for the transfer since February, and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s legislature voted in June to accept the area. But Azerbaijani authorities opposed the idea, and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> last week deemed annexation `` impossible.'' Pravda reported Tuesday that party leaders in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> met a day earlier to discuss `` the instigatory character of speeches at meetings'' held in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital. The leaders `` condemned the extremist, instigatory, politically harmful speeches and urged ... all the ideological agencies to launch effective efforts to expose the anti-people character ... of the activists,'' Pravda reported. About three-quarters of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s 162,000 residents are Armenians, and they have complained of discrimination at the hands of Azerbaijani authorities. Armenians are mostly Christian, while <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> is predominantly Moslem. Widespread general strikes and work stoppages that have disrupted the disputed region for two months began subsiding Monday, when <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 78 percent of the region's workers showed up at their jobs. On Tuesday, more than 85 percent of the first-shift workers in the 17 largest factories in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s main city, reported for work, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It said all the region's factories, stores, service shops and public transport agencies were working for the second day in a row. Some Armenians have vowed to continue the fight for annexation, but central authorities have made it clear that police will come down harder on future demonstrations or strikes. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report from <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> indicated <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders were conducting a mass campaign to persuade <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s residents that the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection of their demands was correct. Activists in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> called last week for a five-day strike to protest the July 18 decision by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, but most residents ignored the call.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> has announced a bid for a third two-year term, promising to work for a universal health care plan similar to that recently adopted in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` It's a basic need that must be met,'' the 54-year-old Democrat said in a speech delivered Monday at <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>'s new community boathouse. `` Every Vermonter has the right to good health care services, and no Vermonter should be denied such services because he or she ca n't pay for them.'' Also on the agenda is implementation of a controversial law to control growth, which <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> championed during the last legislative session. The law requires that communities planning for growth follow specific guidelines. It also increased the property transfer tax to help pay for planning. <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> does n't have a challenger in the September primary election. She is likely to face House Republican Leader <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> in November. <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> also is unopposed in the primary. <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> said after her speech that she did not have a specific plan to fund the health care program but suggested that it would be funded jointly by the public and private sectors. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law requires the state by 1992 to arrange pooled insurance for small businesses and individuals, which participants can buy on a sliding fee scale based on income. The law also requires businesses with more than five full-time employees to offer health insurance coverage or pay an unemployment surcharge to help the state provide coverage to the uninsured. <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> is a strong backer of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee.

<TEXT>
 Hungarian Prime Minister <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> dampened expectations Tuesday of a unilateral withdrawal of Soviet troops from his <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact country, saying any withdrawal of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> should be linked to troop reductions elsewhere in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said he had talked about the presenceof 65,000 Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and `` we agreed to continue this discussion.'' But in a speech and a news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` To withdraw forces from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, others would have to be disbanded as well.'' He plugged hard for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade and promised widespread economic and political reforms while acknowledging <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was plagued with problems of alcohol and stagnant factories. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said the Hungarian constitution would be revised next year and that four times as many Hungarians were permitted to leave the country to visit abroad in the first half of this year than in the first six months of 1987. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> in May succeeded <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who took charge in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> in 1956 as Soviet troops suppressed what <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> called a `` counterrevolutionary'' uprising. He will see President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday and has spent a week traveling in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sampling the products of capitalism and committing <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to a more independent course than the country followed under <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>. Explaining <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economic problems, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said the country had not moved fast enough on the political front to expand the rights of the individual workers and factory managers to make their own decisions. `` Political without economic reform, no, it's not possible,'' he said, speaking through a translator. On the same theme, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said, `` The two processes must be fitted to each other. You can not separate them practically. Political and economic endeavors take place in one body.'' He said writers were gaining more freedom and all Hungarians were able to express their views, although the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also retains the right to do so. At the same time, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said works by Hungarian expatriates were not permitted into the country `` if they are against the constitution'' and that he was against removing <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> from the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. Speculation that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would withdraw the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> unilaterally from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has circulated for at least a month. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, citing intelligence sources, kept the rumors moving. But they have not panned out. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s remarks suggested <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would blend any withdrawal from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> into larger negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact on an overall reduction of conventional troops, armor and aircraft in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. No date has been set for negotiations, with the chief stumbling block a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand that the Soviets agree to hold simultaneous talks about human rights improvements at home and in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has landed a $ 3.6 billion contract for a computer system that will replace voice communications between air traffic controllers and pilots with electronic messages and eventually may usher in the use of computers to actually direct aircraft. The system, expected to be in full operation at the turn of the century, also would give controllers advance warning of overcrowded air traffic conditions. An <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> executive called the contract the largest ever received by the company and officials said it was the largest ever awarded by the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> bested <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, for the 10-year contract to develop the Advanced Automation System for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> had spent $ 233 million of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s money and about $ 80 million of its own in the competition. The system, which is to be developed by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and more than a dozen subcontractors, is designed to provide controllers with more modern computer capacity and flexibility to handle increased air traffic loads. The project outlined in the contract is expected to be completed in 1998, although other enhancements are likely to be made after that to meet additional requirements, officials said. The new system is to be introduced in 1992 when it is scheduled to be installed at the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s air traffic control center in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> called the new system `` a significant milestone and a historic step toward the future'' of air traffic control. The new computer system and radar screens will allow controllers to use modern computer terminals and provide clearer displays, weather information and eventually the means to predict when airspace is expected to become crowded, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Controllers eventually will communicate with aircraft by data link _ computer messages _ instead of by voice. Although planners envision eventual modifications that would allow the computers to talk directly to aircraft through data links, <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said there always will be `` a controller in the loop.'' The new technology will allow controllers `` to work smarter not harder,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that the increased automation represented by the new system would reduce the number of additional controllers needed over the next 20 years. <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>, deputy secretary of transporation, called the system to be provided by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> `` an entirely new generation of air traffic control hardware and software'' that will `` provide the capacity needed for continually increasing air traffic well into the next century while substantially enhancing safety.'' She said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s Federal Systems Division was selected over <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ground </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> largely because its bid was lower. She declined to characterize how much lower the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> bid was, except to say the government `` benefited a great deal -LRB- on costs -RRB- from the strong competition.'' `` Both bids were extremely competent technically,'' she told a news conference. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebker </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> vice president and head of its Systems Integration Division, said the contract `` is the largest contract that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has ever received'' either from the government or private industry. About 50 percent of the $ 3.6 billion project will be subcontracted to other companies, although a list of subcontractors has yet to be developed, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, the project manager. Two of the biggest subcontractors will be <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, which will design and manufacture the consoles and display equipment, and <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, which will develop the software. First word of the contract being awarded to <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> came in a one-sentence announcement late Monday, although at the time DOT officials refused to elaborate or provide additional details. The Advanced Automation System is the cornerstone of the government's broad-ranging air traffic control modernization program which is estimated to cost at least $ 16 billion when it is completed. Aviation experts have long complained that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s current computer equipment is outdated. Recently, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> completed installation of an interim computer system, also produced by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> under a separate $ 197 million contract, which is to serve as a bridge until the more advanced system is available.

 Supreme Court Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> on Tuesday refused to permit the federal government to give drug tests to federal prison employees while a lawsuit over the practice is pending. Justice <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> denied without comment an emergency government request for a stay of a lower court injunction against testing during the lawsuit. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on July 1 had refused to disturb the lower court injunction.

The American Federation of Government Employees is suing to overturn the bureau's plan to require random testing of 5 percent to 10 percent of some 13,000 prison employees each year. The union contends that random testing, without individual suspicion of illegal drug use, violates, among other things, the constitutional prohibition against illegal searches. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is expected to hear arguments this fall on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's drug-testing program in other government agencies.

<HEAD>Report: Cage Around Bus' Fuel Tank Wouldn't Have Helped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The crash and fire that killed 27 people on a church bus probably would not have been prevented by a protective cage around the vehicle's fuel tank, a state fire marshal reported Tuesday. After examining fuel-tank cages on other buses, investigators concluded `` the protective cage is to prevent the tank from being torn away during collision and not to protect it against puncture,'' the report said. The report confirmed that the fire which engulfed the bus owned by <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> of God church was caused by gasoline gushing from a puncture, 2 -LCB- to 3 inches long, in the fuel tank. The bus, carrying 67 people home from an outing at an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> amusement park, and a pickup truck going the wrong way collided near <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION> on Interstate 71 on May 14. The truck driver, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Worthville </LOCATION>, was driving while drunk, authorities said. He was indicted Friday on 27 counts of murder _ one for each victim of the crash _ and pleaded innocent. The puncture probably was caused by one of the bus' front leaf springs and the fuel tank was pushed 24 to 26 inches to the rear of its normal position, the report said. `` Given the location of the puncture with respect to where the cage would have been, it is doubtful ... that a protective cage would have prevented the puncture of this particular tank in this particular incident,'' the report said. The report said investigators could not pinpoint the source of ignition. But investigators confirmed that the bus' front door was knocked from its mounts, blocking escape. The 1977 Superior bus, bought by the church from a school system, was among the last models manufactured before fuel-tank cages became a federal requirement on school buses. The fire marshal's report recommended escape-exit windows and roof hatches in new and old buses. The state has ordered `` pop-out'' emergency windows on new buses and recommended them for old ones, but decided against action on roof hatches. The report's other recommendations included relocating fuel tanks away from the side door of a bus; requiring emergency escape training for passengers who ride buses on daily or weekly schedules; restricting use of flammable materials in seats; and improved driver training. Meanwhile, residents of <LOCATION> Carroll </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where the accident occurred, on Monday turned over a petition to the county clerk, calling for a referendum Oct. 4 on banning liquor sales. A group called Concerned Citizens for Better Life gathered 1,076 signatures, more than twice the 509 needed for the alcohol sales referendum. By Tuesday, Judge-Executive <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Westrick </PERSON> had not verified the signatures. A 1985 vote that let <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION> businesses sell liquor by the drink was decided by just 13 votes.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> departs Thursday on a Soviet trip expected to include unprecedented visits to air, ground and naval bases, although a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official expressed chagrin Tuesday that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had not set the exact schedule. During four days in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> will meet his Soviet counterpart, Gen. <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, to continue discussions on reducing military tension between the superpowers. But <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> will not be drawn into discussions of conventional and nuclear arms control issues that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say should be conducted in established and ongoing negotiations involving diplomats from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> frequently tries to engage various parties in government and out of government as surrogate negotiators in the arms control area,'' a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. `` We are not there to negotiate arms control agreements ... or to play these kind of games,'' said the official, who spoke on condition he not be further identified. Despite the tough talk, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials were looking forward to a visit they hoped would provide their first close look at Soviet bases since World War II. `` We find it useful to have greater access to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, not only to tell our story, but to see for ourselves firsthand the types of leadership they have and their approach to military issues,'' the official said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, accompanied by <ORGANIZATION> Assistant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and a planeload of other officials, was to depart <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday for <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. There they will meet with Finnish President <PERSON> Mauno </PERSON> <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON> and other officials before arriving in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Monday for the talks. After departing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> next Thursday, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> will fly to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> for meetings with Turkish President <PERSON> Kenan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evren </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> and senior defense officials. He was to visit <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Izmir </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Aug. 8. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was expected to visit the <ORGANIZATION> Frunze </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Kubinka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> about 30 miles west of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> capital and the base of the Tuman division, part of the Soviet ground forces. He is expected to fly to <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Crimean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> on Wednesday to look at elements of the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> fleet. At the beginning of July, Soviet Chief of Staff Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> took a tour of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities that included a close view of flight operations on the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theodore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> and a look inside a B-1 bomber and a Minuteman missile training facility. In return, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials let it be known that they wanted to see a Soviet Blackjack bomber and visit Soviet ships at sea. `` We understand that ... -LRB- <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> -RRB- will go out on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. But we have not heard the details as to whether that will be on a combat vessel or on a ferry boat,'' the official said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they did not know whether the Soviets would allow reporters and photographers to accompany <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> during his visit. Such coverage was permitted for parts of <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>'s trip. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official who discussed the trip with reporters complained that the Soviets had not given <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> an exact itinerary. `` Generally, when we are going there, the details of the schedule are often left until the last few minutes,'' the official said. `` While we went out of our way to make sure that everything we showed <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> was unclassified ... he saw real equipment and real troops. ... He saw the real world. What we are looking for is the real world, not a rigid display or a Potemkin village,'' the official said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> will ask <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> more about the Soviets' highly publicized doctrine of `` defensive sufficiency,'' which the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> says precludes the offensive use of military forces. `` When Marshal <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> came here last time, he indicated he would answer all of our questions. Let me say, it is not clear that he answered any of our questions,'' said the official. `` So far, we have seen no changes in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> force posture, production or military spending.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> also will press the Soviets to move ahead on an agreement announced on July 11 between <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> and the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, to set up a working group to discuss ways of avoiding dangerous military situations. And he will try to nail down specifics of an agreement announced by <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> for the exchange of visits by warships, professors at military academies and senior staff and field commanders.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> on Tuesday accused Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of possibly missing a chance to end the Palestinian uprising by not accepting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan to resolve the dispute. Legislators who spoke on condition of anonymity reported on the shouting match in a closed-door meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which signaled the start of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s election campaign. Also Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected an appeal by the governing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc to intervene in a pre-elections squabble, paving the way for holding national and municipal elections on separate dates, which <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' left-of-center Labor party favors. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> has asked the high court to intervene in Monday's legislative decision to oust a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> committee chairman who blocked a bill separating national and local elections The decision means the bill will probably pass, a defeat for <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, which had hoped to ride on the coattails of strong local councils and win more votes to the parliament. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s rightist <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> party inspired the Palestinian uprising by rejecting Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s peace initiatives, which include an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conference. Aides to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said he intends to make the peace negotiations a central element in his campaign for the premiership in the November elections. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' right-wing adversaries, led by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, have also vowed to make peace in the occupied territories central to the campaign, and to attack <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> for his failure to quell the nearly 7-month-old Arab uprising, in which 233 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed. Labor supports a retreat from the occupied territories in return for peace, while <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> opposes any concessions to the Arabs. The two parties have shared governmental powers after a 1984 coalition agreement was forged to break an election stalemate. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> opened the two-hour foreign policy briefing by lashing out at <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who implied that Labor sided with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in a 1986 Israeli government decision to submit a border dispute to international arbitration. Recent Israeli news reports said the arbitors may restore to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> the strip of desert beach called <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized when it occupied <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> in the 1967 Middle East War. `` This is the first time in my life that someone who also voted for the arbitration tries to absolve himself of responsibility,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was quoted by Labor legislators as saying. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of `` missing a chance for peace'' by failing to accept <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan. `` If it were n't for the sabotage of the peace process, of the Shultz initiative, by half the government, then maybe we would n't be in the middle of the intefadeh,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> reportedly said, using the Arabic word for `` uprising. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Eliahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Elissar </PERSON> interrupted <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, shouting, `` You're not coming here with clean hands!'' He called <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> a `` bolshevik,'' referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s left-leaning ideology <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> responded by shouting at <PERSON> Ben-Elissar </PERSON>, `` You're always slandering! You act like a fascist!'' according to Labor legislator <PERSON> Micha </PERSON> <PERSON> Harish </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harish </PERSON> said the debate reflected the significance of the peace issue in the election campaign. `` It will be without a doubt the central issue,' he said. Pollsters predict a tight race between Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, with the latter holding a slight edge largely due to support for Israeli hawkishness in response to the Palestinian uprising.

 Major collective bargaining settlements in private industry during the first six months of this year provided for wage increases averaging 2.2 percent a year, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. The department said this was a slight decline from the 2.9 percent average wage increases in the contracts the last time they were negotiated, generally two to three years ago. The contracts in the first six months of the year covered 1.02 million workers. While the report on collective bargaining agreements indicated no rise in inflationary pressures, another report covering both union and non-union employees did show a pickup in labor costs. The department said that overall wages and fringe benefits rose 4.6 percent for the 12 months ending in June, compared to a smaller 3.3 percent increase a year ago. This report, in addition to covering union and non-union employees, also measures total labor costs, including salaries and such fringe benefits as health insurance and pension plans. The report said much of the acceleration in labor costs came from rising health insurance premiums. Economists have been watching closely for accelerating wage demands at this advanced stage of the recovery from the 1981-82 recession. Many economists believe that as long as wage demands remain moderate, inflation will not be a threat and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will be able to keep credit conditions loose enough to keep the recovery alive. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON>, senior economist at the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a private economic forecasting firm, said that the slowdown in wage increases in collective bargaining agreements provided solid evidence that wage pressures are not beginning to build. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, called the rise in collective bargaining agreements a `` very modest increase'' but he said the pickup in overall labor costs as reflected in the government's employment cost index was more worrisome. `` I think we are already seeing wage pressures in some industries, such as services,'' he said. `` Next year, with unemployment rates in the current low range, we will see even more pressure on wages.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday his pro-growth administration also has been `` staunchly pro-environment'' and the message being sent to polluters is, `` You're out of luck.'' In a White House ceremony honoring 94 volunteer efforts to preserve the nation's natural treasures, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recited a litany of successes by his administration in protecting scenic rivers, endangered species of animals and fragile habitats. He said the administration has cracked down on polluters with record numbers of criminal convictions. He praised the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of toxic waste disposal, likening federal regulators to actor <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>'s tough-guy movie cop, Dirty Harry. `` The message to polluters is crystal clear. We told them in the words of Dirty Harry: ` You're out of luck.' Cleaner air, cleaner water, increased protection for American wildlife _ this pro-growth administration has also been staunchly pro-environment,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the `` Take Pride in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' awards ceremony. <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> is a spokesman for the program. `` The same spirit of creativity and innovation that's created 17 million jobs has also benefited the land itself, making <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the beautiful more beautiful,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. But a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> attacked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s claims and said the administration's record on the environment is absymal and ranks as `` the worst ever in history.'' `` There's no question <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his appointees have cooperated to cut back virtually every environmental program we have and have ignored facts on some of our new problems,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, legislative director of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech was an attempt to boost Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bid for the presidency because the environment has `` clearly become a campaign issue.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised the `` Take Pride in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' winners for their stewardship of the nation's `` crown jewels.'' `` You helped clean litter out of the <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, have given medical care to Alaskan wildlife, planted gardens in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and helped preserve the wetlands of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and much, much more,'' he said. More than 540 groups and individuals were nominated for the second-annual awards. The program is a public-private partnership involving 44 states, two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territories, nine federal agencies and dozens of private organizations. Flanked by <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> and Agriculture Secretaries <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used the occasion to say his administration has `` set the highest standards of enforcing the environmental protection laws'' and pointed to 852 civil enforcement actions filed in his first term, nearly 2 -LCB- times the rate of the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration. `` But we did n't stop there. We took it one step further and established the environmental crimes unit because in the past virtually no environmental cases were criminally prosecuted. We've obtained over 400 criminal indictments and over 300 convictions and guilty pleas,'' he said Among his administration's other accomplishments are a $ 1 billion restoration program to improve and protect national parks, the addition of millions of acres to the national wilderness preservation system and the creation of 34 new national wildlife refuges totaling more than 400,000 acres in 20 states. The number of rivers protected as wild and scenic has tripled since 1981, he said, and the administration has made 271 additions to the endangered and threatened species list. Emissions of `` manmade pollutants into the air have been significantly reduced,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has used the `` Superfund'' toxic waste cleanup program to complete work at more than 1,000 emergency hazardous waste sites and work currently is under way at 700 sites on the national priority list for toxic cleanup, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` We've kept <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s commitment to land and wildlife management, clean air, clean water and a healthier environment for us all,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

 Peace activist <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON> was sentenced to six months in jail Tuesday for trespassing on a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warship. `` You have eight prior felony convictions and at least nine misdemeanor convictions ... because of that you have forfeited the right to vote or be a candidate, to do things where you can make a difference,'' federal Magistrate <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said in setting the maximum sentence. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> ordered the courtroom cleared for the sentencing after about three dozen <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON> supporters began reading a statement in unison. <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Boertje </PERSON>, 32, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, 27, and Sister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON>, 57, admitted boarding the battleship <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> during an open house at the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, slipping away from escorts and attacking two of the ship's cruise missile launchers with hammers, boltcutters and vials of blood. They did only minor damage to the armored launchers. The four claimed their action was the `` symbolic disarming'' of nuclear weapons that they said were illegal under international law. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> found all four guilty of misdemeanor trespassing in May. At Tuesday's sentencing, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasileski </PERSON> said the sincerity of the four did not excuse their actions. `` Mr. <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON>'s record shows 20 years of offenses in the name of his cause,'' <PERSON> Wasileski </PERSON> said. `` It saddens the government that he should so thoroughly reject the democratic process.'' <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON> offered no evidence or argument during the sentencing. Previously, Sister <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON> was placed on two years probation on the condition she not enter a military establishment. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> received a 4-month jail sentence and <PERSON> Boertje </PERSON> six months.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> will release an unclassified report on the downing of <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> flight 655 as soon as possible, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said Tuesday, but he declined to set a date. Rear Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogarty </PERSON>, who is supervising the investigation, will prepare classified and unclassified versions of the report on why the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> shot down an <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Air A300 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> with 290 people aboard on July 3. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the ship mistook the airliner for an attacking F-14 fighter. `` The investigating group is working on a concurrent unclassified version of the report in addition to the normal classified report,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Farm Panel Approves Drought Bill, Moves to Raise Dairy Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved on Tuesday a drought relief bill totaling $ 6 billion, including a $ 145 million benefit pushed by dairy-state lawmakers for milk producers despite President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s warning not to create `` windfalls for some'' or bust the budget. `` It is the duty of this committee to assure that there is an adequate supply of milk,'' said Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Vt </LOCATION>., as the panel adopted the provision to raise the price support for each 100 pounds of milk by 50 cents The committee approved the dairy plan 15-12 and then sent the entire $ 6 billion relief bill to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, where consideration is expected this week. The bill already contained a provision to cancel a 50-cent cut in the dairy price support scheduled for Jan. 1. The further benefit for the politically influential dairy industry would actually raise the price support. The move brought warnings that the bill could be headed for trouble. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., said that provision `` does tend to treat one segment of agriculture more favorably than other segments of agriculture. `` This amendment makes the whole bill more vulnerable when we go to the floor,'' <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> said. There also was speculation that the dairy increase, which would cost the government $ 145 million over two years by committee estimate, might trigger a presidential veto of the legislation. No similar provision is contained in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s drought relief bill, which also is expected to come to the floor this week. Farm lawmakers from the two houses are planning to meet in a conference committee next week to fashion a final version of the legislation. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel acted despite a specific warning from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> not to provide windfalls to special interests or run to excess with spending proposals. `` To put it very simply, we must not bust the budget,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, D-Texas. He also said that `` creating windfalls for some will mean less for the truly deserving.'' He urged de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> to avoid penalizing farmers who purchase federal crop insurance by providing equal benefits to those without it. And he called on the chairman not to `` force farmers to do unreasonable things.'' `` No program should, for example, include any incentive for a farmer to plow under his crops,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, whose home state is a major source of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION>'s milk supply, warned that dairy herds would dwindle without the increase in the support level and cause a milk shortage that would be hard to rectify `` Cows do n't drop from the sky,'' he said. He said the shortage would raise prices and `` then you're going to hear screams from consumers that you just wo n't believe.'' Proponents shrugged off studies by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and a private group of agricultural economists holding that no milk shortage was in the offing under the program as it stands. At the outset of the committee's session, Deputy Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> told lawmakers that the administration already disapproved of provisions of the bill that would expand government feed benefits for livestock and dairy producers. He also said the administration was opposed to a provision that would require farmers to buy federal crop insurance in the next two years in order to be eligible for disaster payments now. The measure would provide disaster payments for growers of all crops whether or not they are covered by federal farm programs equal to 65 percent of crop losses in excess of 35 percent of expected yield. There would be additional payments for farmers who suffered an almost total wipeout of their crops. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was still struggling to add a similar provision to its version, although the panel already has given final approval to its bill. Benefits for livestock producers, primarily from expanded and streamlined federal feed assistance programs, would be capped at $ 50,000 for each individual. Payments to crop producers would be limited to $ 100,000 per person. Crop producers would not be required to repay so-called deficiency payments, or federal income supports, that they already have received in advance. Before approving the measure, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee also showed compassion for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cotton growers in the district of Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Combest </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, whose crops were damaged in 1987 by hail. The panel approved a $ 24 million amendment that also would supply disaster payments to those growers. Proponents acknowledged that the damage had nothing to do with the drought but noted that there was a similar disaster relief bill in 1986 but not in 1987. They said the <PERSON> Combest </PERSON> plan would `` fill in the gaps.''

<TEXT>
 Old Faithful Geyser, shooting water hotter than 200 degrees as high as 184 feet in the air, is <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>'s most popular tourist attraction and often is considered the symbol of the country's national park system. The geyser is about 10 miles east of the 5,500-acre `` North Fork'' fire, and firefighters are trying to help wind turn the blaze from the area. While the geyser, one of more than 200 in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, is not the most powerful in the park, it is the best-known, attracting 78 percent of the park's visitors as it erupts 21 to 23 times a day at intervals from 33 minutes to more than two hours. The geyser was discovered by an exploring party in 1870, two years before the park was established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. A geyser is a hot spring from which water and steam are ejected periodically. The eruptions are caused by the contact between ground water and rock that is hot enough to create steam. The Old Faithful Inn, built in 1904, was the first building in the area, which now has three lodges, including one for use during the winter. The inn, placed on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>'s list of national historic landmarks in 1987, was expanded in 1913 and 1927 to provide 324 rooms. Other accommodations at the site include the Old Faithful Lodge cabins, providing 132 rooms, and the Old Faithful Snow Lodge, which remains open in winter, with 65 rooms. Old Faithful is the one of two areas of the park open for winter users who reach the area on cross-country skis or by snowmobile. Mammoth Hot Springs is also open in winter. Other services at Old Faithful include a general store and two service stations, one of which remains open in the winter. There are no campgrounds in the area.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee named attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> to conduct an ethics investigation against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, a prominent <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Democrat, promised `` an independent, full review'' of allegations that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> abused his office for personal gain. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., said Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of the evenly divided 12-member panel had agreed on the selection of <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, and were satisified that he could do an impartial job even though he has been active in Democratic campaigns and fund raising The committee is satisfied, `` notwithstanding the fact that he has exercised his right -LRB- to political activity -RRB-, based on his ability and his reputation, that he can in this case be fair and impartial,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., the panel's senior Republican, concurred <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said the committee had decided to hire outside counsel when it formally opened its six-count investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, on June 9, but had withheld announcement of the decision until someone was chosen for the job. The contract with <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s firm, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON>, will be for no more than $ 300,000, he said. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said he could not estimate how long the investigation will take to complete. `` As I see our job, it's to conduct an independent, full review of all the facts that have been presented in the inquiry and report back to the committee,'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> told reporters in a brief appearance outside the closed committee room. `` The fact that I'm a Democrat does n't stand in my way of being fair and full,'' he added. `` I would hope that no citizen would be branded unfair or unobjective simply because he exercised his basic American right.'' He said his selection was `` a great opportunity for me, and I appreciate the confidence the committee had. I'm going to do my very, very best. But <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, in response to a question, said <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> would not be authorized to go beyond the scope of the six-count resolution of inquiry unanimously adopted by the panel on June 9. That drew a complaint from Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s chief accuser, who said no inquiry could be considered independent if it does not permit investigators to follow leads to their `` The independent counsel has to be truly independent,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said. `` He can not be on a short leash held by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman of the committee.'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> objected to the choice of <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, whom he called a partisan Democrat. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lawyer has been a fund-raiser for the presidential campaign of Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, according to an article in the January issue of the American Lawyer. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s selection also was criticized by Citizens for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, which sent a Mailgram to the committee saying, `` The appointment of liberal Democrat activist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> as outside counsel in the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> case certainly calls into question the independence of the ethics committee inquiry.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> complained that <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> appears to be trying to set impossible standards for the investigation so he can criticize it _ no matter what the outcome _ as a whitewash. `` Failing to have any substance on which to rely, they are trying to lay the impression that the inevitable result of a clear bill of health is somehow a whitewash,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` They would have said that no matter whom they chose'' as outside counsel, he added. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is under formal investigation on charges of using his office to lobby federal officials and others on matters in which he had a financial interest, and for alleged improprieties in the publication of a book by a campaign contractor for which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received unusually high royalties, among other charges. Just a few hours before the announcment, the lobbying group <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION> asked the committee to demonstrate publicly that any outside counsel will have authority and independence. The request, in a letter from <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Archibald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> to <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, said that could be done by giving the investigator full authority to investigate, review documents, issue subpoenas and present evidence to the panel; to hire whatever staff is needed to conduct the inquiry; and to recommend formal charges be brought before the committee if warranted. The panel also should guarantee that the outside counsel `` shall be free, after discussion with the committee, to make such public statements and reports as the counsel deems appropriate,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> declined to respond publicly to the Common Cause letter. He said the panel had been considering <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> as outside counsel for several weeks and said the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney had been interviewed individually by all Republican and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> members of the committee. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he does not know <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, but added, `` apparently, he's a reputable attorney.''

When <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> does travel, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said he expected the money to come from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> because the trips will be focusing on voter registration and related efforts more than direct campaigning for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` But that has not been totally settled yet, either,'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said. `` We know that that we're going to find the money to get him around.'' <PERSON> Brazile </PERSON> said she has asked <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aides interested in joining the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp to express their interest soon so that the campaign can draft its fall campaign payroll by early August. In addition, she said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and aides would use the next few campaign trips to reach out to volunteers and elected officials who supported <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> during the primaries. Meetings are planned in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> during the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign swing this weekend, she said. <PERSON> Brazile </PERSON>, who worked for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in 1984, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has moved to include <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters much faster than 1984 nominee <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. `` It took a long time for the Mondale people to get us on board, late August,'' she said. `` We're in a much better position.''

<HEAD>Missing Woman Believed Victim of Voodoo Obsession</HEAD>

 A married woman missing for nearly two months may have been killed and buried in a desolate grave beneath a crude cross, the victim of her lover's suicidal obsession with voodoo, police said Tuesday. <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON>'s disappearance June 2 and the discovery of a makeshift altar and mystical paraphernalia in her boyfriend's closet have led detectives on a search through the strange subculture of the primitive religion Police theorize that <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON>, 52, was killed by her lover of 20 years, a roofing contractor who changed his name in 1979 from <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> to <PERSON> Che </PERSON> <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>. <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>, 47, was found dead in his bed of cyanide poisoning when investigators broke into his barricaded home June 7 expecting to find <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON>'s body. Investigators found a crude altar and other items in his closet, including three snapshots of <LOCATION> Rubia </LOCATION> covered with salt and three one-quart <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> jars turned upside down with a strip of tape labeled `` Me'' on one, a second labeled `` <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON>'' with `` Stop it!'' written underneath and a third reading `` <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> and I.'' The jars were covered with salt and contained spices, peppers and molasses. A recipe found in <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>'s garbage can mixed tartar powder, crushed red pepper and crosses. Investigators went to a <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> religion expert with the items. They also presented the expert with desperate letters <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON> mailed before his suicide blaming <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON> and her `` witchcraft'' for his bad health and business failures. The expert theorized <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON> buried <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON> in a way that would prevent her spirit from escaping. He said the grave likely would be covered with salt and pins and that the victim's hands probably would be tied. `` Salt and pins were to keep her spirit confined, even in death, and that's why the expert was sure she was tied, too,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. Authorities are hoping the expert will help them find <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON>'s body Her bloody prescription glasses were found in <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>'s pickup truck after he committed suicide. The <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> expert, a self-described `` good witch'' who police did not name, told officers the items are those used in voodoo, an African-born religion based on a belief in sorcery. The jars, molasses and spices were supposed to seal in bad spirits and prevent them from attacking <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>, the expert said. `` He wanted a barrier between him and her in both worlds,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>'s ex-wife said <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON> was fearful of spirits when married to her and would cover her doll collection to smother its power. <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON> told friends <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON> was slowly poisoning him, said Detective <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s missing-persons unit <PERSON> Rubia </PERSON> attended a Catholic retreat shortly before her disappearance at which she decided to leave her lover and devote herself to her husband and family, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said.

 Thousands of mourners chanted prayers Tuesday as the bodies of the head priest of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> and another Sikh leader were cremated the day after they were slain by extremists. The bodies of <PERSON> Sohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, head priest of <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a scholar and secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Shiromani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gurdwara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prabandhak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which manages the temple, were borne in separate processions from their homes to the Golden Temple. They were then laid out at nearby cremation grounds, where Sikh rites and prayers chanted by 3,000 mourners accompanied the burning of the bodies on funeral pyres. `` This is an attack on all Sikhs because the post of head priest carries special status and honor among us,'' said former Sikh chief priest <PERSON> Kirpal </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who performed the last rites. Sikh gunmen opened fire Monday on <PERSON> Sohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mal </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghuman </PERSON>, another temple official, as they emerged from a meeting at a college in <LOCATION> Ludhiana </LOCATION>, about 75 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ghuman </PERSON> was seriously injured in the attack but was reported out of danger Tuesday after surgery. The <ORGANIZATION> Khalistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Babbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalsa </PERSON> group _ both extremist groups _ claimed the killings in a handwritten note found Tuesday outside the house of a journalist from a Punjabi-language newspaper. The reporter asked that his name not be used. Underground Sikh groups in the northern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> region have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for an independent homeland. A.P. <PERSON> Pandey </PERSON>, a senior police official in <LOCATION> Ludhiana </LOCATION>, said the note gave no clue to help in the statewide manhunt for the killers. He said there had been no breakthrough in the case. On Tuesday, three more people, including two members of one family, were killed in attacks blamed on Sikh extremists, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The latest casualties raised the death toll to nearly 1,600 in the guerrilla war this year. Militant Sikhs, who are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> but make up less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s population, charge they are discriminated against by the majority Hindus.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> testified on Tuesday that he resigned in protest last March after telling his boss, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, that the attorney general had probably broken the law. And <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s former top deputy, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, said he quit the same day because of the `` deep malaise'' at the department, adding that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was living in `` a world of <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> in Wonderland'' about his problems. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> were an ordinary citizen, he probably would have been prosecuted for taking gratuities from his longtime friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, who resigned March 29 to protest <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continued tenure in the face of a criminal investigation by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, said that he told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> the day hequit that the statute barring the acceptance of gratuities in exchange for the performance of official duties `` Certainly would reach the conduct of Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and probably that of Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said he reiterated his views in April in a 40-minute meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said he concluded that the attorney general had certainly violated federal ethics guidelines prohibiting public officials from committing acts which give any appearance of impropriety. Before resigning, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said he decided that `` if Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> were an ordinary public official, he would be prosecuted under the gratuity law.'' `` When I was the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, we successfully prosecuted building inspectors who accepted gifts from friends who maintained they merely wanted to ` get in good,' or ` say thanks,' or ` expedite' an otherwise lawful official action,'' the former assistant attorney general told the committee. `` In short, I came to the conclusion that this set of facts was sufficiently serious that I felt I could not continue as chief of the criminal division at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, the former deputy attorney general, disclosed new details about their <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> describing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as becoming `` florid, very upset.'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appeared `` distressed'' during what <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> described as a `` very frank and candid'' discussion in which <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, among other things, outlined how a `` deep malaise'' had set in at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> because <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> refused to step down. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> listed for the committee 63 items of fact concerning the attorney general's relationship with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, which <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said bolstered his contention that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had violated ethics regulations and probably had violated the gratuities statute. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> publicly proclaimed his access to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was paid from $ 1.3 million to $ 1.4 million by the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` That's too much for a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> tort lawyer helping out a company in a government contracting context'' and `` raises a question as to what he's doing for them,'' said <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> ignored his advice to distance himself from <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said that he told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> around April 8, 1987 that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> `` was in a lot of trouble'' and that <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> had told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that `` <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was in deep yogurt.'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> currently is under indictment for alleged racketeering in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal. `` I advised Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to distance himself from Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, told him to sever his relationship with Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, told him to repudiate Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. My advice was not heeded,'' said <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said he was shocked around May 1, 1987 when <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, weeks after being told that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was under criminal investigation in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, told <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> that a job offer by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> to become his counselor in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was still open. `` Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> crept up on him; Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> horn-swoggled him,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said when asked by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, to explain why <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> would have continued to hold a post open for <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> last week categorically denied that he had entertained any idea of hiring <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> once he learned that the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> personal injury lawyer was under investigation in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> responded bitterly to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s suggestion Monday that <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> had failed to carry out a competent and thorough preliminary inquiry in the spring of 1987, thus triggering the criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> by <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who has decided not to seek an indictment of the attorney general. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> disclosed a letter of May 11, 1987 from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers in which they ask that matters concerning <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> be referred to a court-appointed independent counsel. `` According to Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, everybody is wrong,'' said <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> continued to defend one <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> ... You can get the flavor of what life is like in the Department of Justice ... It's a world of <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> in Wonderland, a world of illusion and allusion, a world in which up is down and down is up; in was out and out was in ... Into the various situations ... there was a common denominator; that common denominator was <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> appears to have become, over time, the financial ` <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> on the spot' for Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was paid $ 150,000 by a partner in a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> assisted <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and the pipeline and both were subjects of <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s criminal investigation. The $ 150,000 was pooled with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s money and that of other investors by financial manager <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, who turned a $ 40,000 profit for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on a $ 55,000 investment in just 18 months. In addition, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> provided <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> with free legal counsel and introduced <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> in the first place. `` It is well documented that Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> enjoyed unparalleled access to Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, and saw him frequently throughout the time Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was in the White House and at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>.

 A woman accused of helping hijack an airliner to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in 1969 worked as a preschool teacher's aide for the last five years before authorities ended her 19 years as a fugitive. Neighbors and her employer said Tuesday they were surprised to learn that the quiet, friendly woman they knew as <PERSON> Haziine </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON> had been using that name and 13 other aliases to keep the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> off her trail. `` We were just as shocked as everybody when the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was outside with guns pointed at everybody,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellino </PERSON>, director of the Masterson Day Care Center a few doors away from <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON>'s apartment in a working-class neighborhood of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> Rifle-toting <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents surrounded the home of 39-year-old <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> and her husband, lawyer <PERSON> Mylo </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON>, and took her into custody Monday on a charge of air piracy, which carries a sentence of 20 years to life in prison. The glum-looking <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>, who would n't talk to reporters while being led away in handcuffs from brief court appearances Monday and Tuesday, had worked for five years as a bus monitor and teacher's aide for Head Start, a preschool for low-income youngsters, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, of the organization's board of directors On Jan. 2, 1969, authorities say, <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> and her then-husband, <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, took a 2-year-old boy hostage on an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, then forced the pilot at gunpoint to fly to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. The woman, who had an infant strapped to her back, ran up the aisle of the plane screaming, followed by <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> shouting `` Black power, <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>'' to terrified passengers and crew, according to news accounts of the hijacking. It was unclear how <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but authorities said they lost track of her during the 1970s. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> died in 1971 from gunshot wounds suffered in a bank robbery attempt in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. An anonymous phone caller tipped off authorities a year ago that <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON> was living in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, and time was taken to nail down the case, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON> said the charges against his wife were `` absolute poppycock.'' He said his wife had lived and worked in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> for 10 years, although police said they had only traced her <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> residence to 1983. `` I think people should speak highly of me and my wife because we've worked diligently to be spoken highly of,'' <PERSON> Eytina </PERSON> said Tuesday, after a federal hearing to establish his wife's identity was put off for one day. The couple had six children, but one was killed last year in an auto accident, said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Alford </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> office. He said he did n't know how long the couple had been married. <PERSON> Grinage </PERSON>, who gave <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION> officials the name of Haziine Ey <PERSON> Tina </PERSON>, had caused no problems at work, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. He said officials checked child abuse records and references and made an `` informal'' check with local police. `` If we had any indication that this was a hostage-taker, we would n't be sitting here today,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. `` There's nothing significant in her five-year history that would indicate there was any abuse or violence toward children.''

<HEAD>Judge Orders VA in Washington State To Refund Foreclosure Millions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to refund $ 3 million to $ 6 million to veterans in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state who lost their homes in foreclosures on VA-backed loans. The order, received Monday by attorneys in the class-action suit, also ordered the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> to erase at least $ 45 million in debt the agency has tried to collect from more than 3,500 veterans who lost their homes to foreclosures. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> found the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> had violated a state law governing the amount of money that could be collected under a section providing a `` shortcut'' for foreclosures. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leen </PERSON>, a lawyer representing five veterans, said a similar suit is pending in federal court in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and that more than $ 200 million in uncollected debts are at stake in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Several other states have laws similar to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s, which could mean hundreds of millions of dollars are due veterans who lost their homes, <PERSON> Leen </PERSON> said. Those states include <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, a law clerk to <PERSON> Leen </PERSON>. The Veterans Administration `` basically wanted their cake and they wanted to eat it too, plus a second helping,'' <PERSON> Leen </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state law established for lenders a shortcut way, known as non-judicial foreclosure, to seize a home from a borrower who failed to make payments on a home loan. In the five cases that made up the class-action suit, the VA chose the non-judicial route to save time and legal fees, believing it could rely on its own regulations to collect from veterans any extra costs it incurred, such as legal fees, court filing costs and losses on resale of the home. However, <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state law provided that lenders could not collect such extra money from debtors when the foreclosure was settled non-judicially, or out of court. <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>'s ruling said the law was meant to protect debtors and that it superceded the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s regulations. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>, staff attorney for the VA in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said Tuesday the agency had not decided whether to appeal <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>'s ruling Part of that decision depends on what effect an appeal might have on other states, he said. <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>'s ruling requires the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> to repay veterans money collected in foreclosures since 1981, the effective date for the statute of limitations. <PERSON> Leen </PERSON> sued in 1987. VA officials estimated they had collected, and would need to refund, $ 3 million to $ 6 million. Last August, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> said it was trying to collect more than $ 45 million from veterans involved in foreclosures in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Leen </PERSON> said papers the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> filed in court now place that figure at $ 63 million. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> stopped trying to collect foreclosure costs in June 1987 after <PERSON> Leen </PERSON> filed the class-action suit. The agency said the moratorium would last until the suit was settled. <PERSON> Leen </PERSON> filed the class-action lawsuit after winning a similar case for <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallejo </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>, a roofer, sued the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> over $ 8,700 in foreclosure costs it sought from him after he lost his home in 1982. `` This is great,'' <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> said. `` A lot of people are going to get their money back.''

<HEAD>Dukakis, Bush Representatives Present Candidates' Natural Gas
Policies</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Both presidential candidates will make natural gas the key to their energy policies, two Texans working for the campaigns told the gas industry Tuesday. Each promised a different menu of tax breaks, to be phased out if prices rise, to help domestic oil and gas drillers. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` feels strongly one of the ways we can solve this tremendous import problem is by playing the gas card,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign finance chairman and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> independent oil and gas producer. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` is going to be somebody who is absolutely the strongest advocate of natural gas we have ever had in this country,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, chairman of the candidate's <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> campaign. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> referred to the growing dependence on imported crude oil and refined products, now more than 41 percent of consumption compared with 35 percent a year ago. Many domestic producers have advocated a tariff on oil imports, but neither man mentioned such a measure in brief speeches before the Natural Gas Roundtable, a monthly luncheon sponsored by gas trade associations. Despite low prices, the country is not consuming all available natural gas. Consumption last year was 25 percent below the 1972 peak and according to industry estimates at least 10 percent to 15 percent below what could be easily delivered from existing wells. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would use natural gas for transportation, both as a vehicle fuel in its own right and a source for methanol, <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said. This would help air pollution problems in cities where the strategy is followed, he said. His package of tax breaks, some of which would restore tax treatment of some oil and gas practices to what it was before the 1986 income tax changes, would be `` phased out as the industry recovers and prices rise,'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said offshore oil drilling, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he opposes in environmentally sensitive areas, and nuclear energy must be part of the nation's energy future. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes further construction of reactors until waste disposal questions are solved and a new design is available. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would grant tax credits for exploration expenses and would seek certain exemptions from application of the alternative minimum tax, <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is exploring a `` strategic natural gas reserve,'' in the form of underground storage dispersed around the country, <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said. Though many gas companies maintain storage, a national program would help counter fears of a resumption of the shortages of the late 1970s, he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also is considering a $ 5 per barrel premium for purchases from new domestic wells for the strategic petroleum reserve, <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said. In some recent years <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has supplied all the oil for the reserve and domestic producers have been reluctant to bid.

<HEAD>Consumer Groups Urge FCC Action Against Independent Operator

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two consumer groups Tuesday asked the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to order the five largest independent telephone operator services out of business, claiming the companies charge excessive rates. Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> said their survey shows these providers' rates are as much as 3 -LCB- times higher than those of the major long-distance companies. The companies, called alternative operator services or AOS companies, provide service to guests in hotels and motels and at pay phones, as well as at some hospitals and universities, which receive commissions from the AOS. The companies handle credit card, collect and third-party billed calls, routing `` 0'' - plus calls over lines leased from the major long-distance carriers <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagenhauser </PERSON>, staff attorney for the center, said consumers need to be protected from the high rates of these companies. `` Just because these are transient consumers does n't mean they should be moving targets,'' he said at a news conference outside the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, prompted by a surge in complaints about AOS companies last spring, launched an investigation into the industry, which began developing about a year and a half ago. The agency also issued a consumer alert advising callers to ask operators what rates they will be charged. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> does not regulate the rates AOS companies charge for interstate long-distance calls. Several states, however, have begun considering regulation of the industry for intrastate calls. The consumer groups criticized the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> for failing to take action against AOS providers. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s telephone enforcement unit, defended the agency against the criticism, noting its inquiry into the industry and its work on behalf of irate consumers seeking credit for AOS calls. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> also has been meeting with AOS companies, <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said. `` I've been pleased with the response with the industry, admitting there are problems and working out solutions.'' The consumer groups said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> should revoke the operating authority of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecharge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, Md.; <ORGANIZATION> Payline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Telesphere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Oakbrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Terrace </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Pease </PERSON>, president of Payline Systems, acknowledged that `` there are some bad apples'' among AOS providers, but he said, `` this industry has a right to compete. <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> said the consumer groups' petition to the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> is unwarranted. He said the marketplace will shake out the unethical companies and a newly formed trade association for operator service providers will help establish a code of ethics for the industry.

<TEXT>
 A minister and his community are taking a leap of faith and opening ... a supermarket. The Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> noticed that in recent years two chains opened and then closed supermarkets in the shopping center down the road from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> in northwestern <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. It seemed to him that retailers were deserting the area as low-income people moved in, forcing residents to leave their neighborhood to buy groceries. So Young decided to try to revitalize the shopping center. He recruited some deacons and other church officials to form <ORGANIZATION> Help </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and sold stock to area residents for $ 10 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Help </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a partnership formed by community leaders, bought the shopping center land and buildings. Church officials did not disclose the price. Today, the shopping center, renamed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> North Plaza, includes an ice cream parlor and Family Dollar Store. A supermarket is to open next month. It will be called <LOCATION> Broma </LOCATION>, a biblical word meaning food. Profit was not the primary motive, said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, but he did his homework in hopes of making <LOCATION> Broma </LOCATION> a success. The pastor and some deacons visited grocery stores around the state to get ideas on how to run theirs. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> also hired a former supermarket co-manager to run the store. About 60 other workers, mostly teen-agers, will stock shelves and run the cash registers. Young admits the venture is a `` tremendous step of faith.'' `` We're trying to address a need. The community will respond to that,'' he said. But the supermarket will have to survive with a handicap: It will not sell beer. `` It's against our doctrine,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Minority-owned broadcast stations provide more programming of interest to minorities than non-minority-owned stations, according to a congressional report. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> also found that stations owned by women cater to female audiences to a larger extent than male-owned stations, though not to the degree that minority-owned stations program to minority audiences. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications subcommittee, requested the study for use in a pending federal court case challenging the constitutionality of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s policy giving preference to minorities and women in awarding broadcast licenses The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> had argued in that case, involving a new FM station at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Simon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, that its preference policy may be unconstitutional because it had no factual evidence that the policies contributed to diversity of programming at radio and television stations. However, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year added a stipulation to the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s budget authorization barring the agency from eliminating the preferences In releasing the study this week, <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said, `` The commission wanted empirical evidence, and now it has a clear record.'' <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Killory </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> general counsel, said the agency was reviewing the study and had no comment on it. `` The commission has to decide what position to take,'' she said. The study analyzed data from an <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> survey of 8,720 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> radio and television stations, about 79 percent of the total. It cautioned about difficulty in determining to what extent a station's programming decisions was driven by the racial, ethinic or female make-up of its audience or resulted from minority-ownership interests. However, the report concluded, `` there is a strong indication that minority and women station-ownership results in a greater degree of minority programming.''

 A Palestinian who may be linked with a terrorist attack aboard a Greek cruise ship appeared in court Tuesday, but the hearing was postponed after he claimed he had not been briefed on the case. After the complaint, a new hearing to check the identity of the Palestinian, identified as 39-year-old <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, was set for Aug. 2, a judicial spokesman said. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> was sentenced July 13 to seven months for entering <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> on a forged passport. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> is considering a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request for his extradition on charges of planting a bomb on a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet that killed a Japanese teen-ager and injured 15 in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in 1982. Police theorize that a machine gun and grenade attack against the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> cruise ship on July 11 was a bungled attempt to hijack the ship and force <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>'s release. The assault left nine people dead and more than 90 injured. Tuesday's hearing before an appeal court prosecutor was a routine procedure in cases where mistaken identity is claimed, said the judicial spokesman, who requested anonymity in keeping with Greek practice. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> claims his real name is <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON> and told reporters at the court `` the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> police arrested the wrong man.'' He was arrested May 29 at <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> while carrying a forged Syrian passport in the name of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said Tuesday he will `` move decisively'' and quickly against defense contractors implicated in the ongoing bribery investigation as soon as he receives more details from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has already ordered a number of changes in the way the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> buys weapons and more are likely as a result of the investigation, he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> probe centers on allegations that defense contractors and consultants, many of whom are former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employes, bribed <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials for inside details about contracts. No charges have yet been filed. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he had no new details about the two-year-old investigation, which became public June 14 when subpoenas were served around the nation. At one point, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> ordered contacts frozen on nine military programs because of the possibility that they may have been tainted, but he rescinded that order 10 days later when a quick review showed there were no problems. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> acted after an affidavit for a search warrant was unsealed in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, providing details about the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has sought to have the affidavits sealed, but several news organizations have challenged that action. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> promised to `` move decisively ... as soon as we receive facts from the Justice investigation.'' Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the committee, noted that `` in the next few weeks, it is expected that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> attorney will authorize the release of information on the investigation now under court seal. `` When that information is available, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> will have more specifics on contracts or source selections that may have been influenced by improper activities,'' he noted. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> repeated his appeals to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to wait until all the facts are made public before ordering sweeping overhauls in the complicated Pentagon purchasing procedures. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he meets daily with a special task force he set up last month to track the investigation and recommend changes. `` My instructions do not limit the nature of the changes,'' he said. `` Nothing is sacred _ neither organizational structure, regulations, nor the need to change existing law.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> cast cold water on one proposal which has surfaced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ holding corporate chief executives responsible for their firms' actions. `` I think it's really impractical,'' he said, and would probably only result in firms declining to bid for Pentagon contracts. `` Ill-conceived reforms can quickly convince many firms that defense business does not provide a sufficient chance for a reasonable profit to make it worthwhile or compensate for the perennial ` stops and starts' of military business,'' he said. He said profit-and-earning `` ratios in the industry are alrady low. If we drive them down further, industry will lack the capital to keep up with modernization.'' He also warned against wide-ranging bans that attempt to close the so-called `` revolving door'' between government and private employment, such as working for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and then going to work for a defense contractor. `` The problems we face in attracting into government service talented individuals from the private sector would be exacerbated by the imposition of a broad post-government employment bar,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Reports Drug, Alcohol Abuse Declines In Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drug and alcohol abuse in the armed forces is steadily declining from the alarmingly high levels of 1980, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said Tuesday. `` We are pleased with this latest decline, which can be attributed to the message that has been sent out to all our military personnel: If you want to stay in, you have to stay off drugs,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. The percentage of military personnel acknowledgng the use of illicit drugs in the 30 days prior to their being surveyed dropped from 27 percent in 1980, to 19 percent in 1982, 9 percent in 1985 and 5.5 percent in 1988. Alarm bells rang when the results of the first drug survey were released by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in 1980. Comprehensive anonymous surveys have been conducted in 1980, 1982, 1985 and this year. In the latest survey, conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the 17,213 men and women taking part did not put their names on the forms, and the exercise was not intended to root out abusers. Those answering the questionaires were chosen to provide a representative sampling of those in the armed forces by age, sex, ethnic group, rank and branch of service. Military officials also conduct random urine tests of suspected drug abusers, and those results also show a declining rate of use, officials say. The most common illegal drug was marijuana, used by 3 percent within the previous 30 days, down from 7 percent in 1985, and by 7 percent within the previous 12 months, down from 11 percent in 1985. Marijuana use was highest in the lower enlisted ranks, with 6 percent reporting use within the previous 30 days compared to 11 percent in 1985 and 15 percent within the previous 12 months, compared to 19 percent in 1985.

 The new Miss Teen <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> said Tuesday she's happy to be a winner and does n't think the disqualification of a rival detracts from her victory. `` I'm really proud of where I am,'' said <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, a 16-year-old from <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. `` It was a wonderful experience, it was such a confidence-booster.'' Miss Teen <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 16-year-old <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Toro </LOCATION>, was allowed to participate in the televised pageant Monday night but was disqualified from competition for rule-breaking, said pageant spokeswoman <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON>. Publicist <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Schecter </PERSON> said after the Monday night telecast that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> had violated curfew, but Ms. <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> on Tuesday refused to specify the infraction. The 51 girls in the contest were chaperoned and required to abide by a number of rules during their three-week stay prior to the pageant. Telephone calls to Miss <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>'s home went unanswered Tuesday. It was the second time in six weeks that controversy has interfered with a beauty contest in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. On June 13, as the winners of the Miss <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> contest were being announced in a televised pageant in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> unfurled a white silk banner that read `` Pageants hurt all women.'' She was hustled from the stage. Miss <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, who gets cash, a Jeep, furs, jewelry and other merchandise worth $ 150,000, said she did n't know <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> had been disqualified until right before the show and was n't told the reason. `` I know nothing about that,'' Miss <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. `` We were told right on stage that she would n't be allowed to participate.'' A brief disclaimer preceded the CBS telecast of the pageant. At a gathering afterward, a reporter who persisted in questioning the contestants about Miss <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>'s disqualification was ordered to leave by contest officials. The semifinalists appeared in bathing suits and evening gowns for 12 celebrity judges. Each was interviewed by <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, host of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bandstand </ORGANIZATION> and the $ 100,000 Pyramid game show.

 Iranian rebels based in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claimed Tuesday their forces drove more than 60 miles into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and the Iranians said their soldiers had killed more than 1,000 of the `` counterrevolutionary elements.'' A seven-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team arrived in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to work out details of a cease-fire in the nearly 8-year-old war, which both sides have offered to accept, and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it was withdrawing its troops from Iranian territory. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, met for 90 minutes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said afterward: `` We had very constructive and fruitful talks about the implementation of Resolution 598,'' the cease-fire resolution the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed unanimously on July 20, 1987. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepted the resolution soon after it was adopted, on condition <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> do the same, but the Iranians refused until reversing their position July 18. <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> foreign minister flew to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Tuesday for similar discussions with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. The resolution calls for a cease-fire, withdrawal to recognized borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an investigation to determine which side started the war. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> urged both sides to exercise restraint and stop pursuing the war. Also on Tuesday, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, speaker of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and armed forces commander-in-chief in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, said his country will use its influence to try to free American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> releases Iranian assets frozen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He spoke on TV, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. But White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` We have heard this kind of thing before, but as far as we are concerned you just ca n't link the two. ... No deals. The clearest signal they could send is to release the hostages.'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Riza </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffaer </PERSON> <PERSON> Zada </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Iranian rebel group <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, said its fighters were advancing on <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION>, a provincial capital, and had `` liberated hundreds of villages.'' He said the attack, code-named `` Eternal Light,'' began at 3 a.m. Monday and rebel units had overrun the cities of <ORGANIZATION> Karand </ORGANIZATION>, about 40 miles inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION>, 20 miles farther. The rebel spokesman also claimed the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>'s fighting force, called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, destroyed the 27th Revolutionary Guards unit based between <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION>, 90 miles inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the central border region. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> acknowledged the invasion, initially blaming it on the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army, but said its soldiers had retaken <PERSON> Eslamabad </PERSON> and killed 1,100 rebels. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` made use of counter-revolutionary mercenaries to infiltrate the population and to martyr the heroic men and women there.'' `` Intense fighting is continuing between the forces of Islam and counterrevolutionary elements,'' said the broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> says it is withdrawing from all Iranian territory it occupied last week after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced its acceptance of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution. On state television, a military spokesman said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces had left Gilan-e Gharb and <PERSON> Salehabad </PERSON>, two Iranian towns, before noon. Information minister <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussayif </PERSON> <PERSON> Jassim </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces would complete the withdrawal after ensuring safety for their troops. A war communique issued late Tuesday said Iraqi jet fighters and helicopter gunships flew 353 combat missions along the 730-mile border warfront. Iraqi officials said earlier their invasions on the central and southern fronts were designed to smash <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s weakened war machine and take more prisoners, apparently to equalize the numbers for exchange under a truce. According to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> held 50,000 Iraqis and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had 13,000 Iranian prisoners before the past week's fighting.

 Israeli troops fatally shot a 13-year-old Palestinian girl and wounded three youths during fighting Tuesday in occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials reported. The army confirmed the girl's death but said it had not determined the cause. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> toured a detention center in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and vowed to quell the eight-month old <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` We do n't accept the present level of violence,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. `` On the contrary, today we have the methods. It will take some time but we shall succeed.'' He did not elaborate. The military commander of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> lifted a curfew that had confined more than 120,000 <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> residents to their homes since last Thursday, the army announced. It said Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> took the action as a gesture of goodwill for the holiday of Eid al-Adha, the Moslem Feast of Sacrifice. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, 13-year-old <PERSON> Suheir </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Afana </PERSON> of the Beach refugee camp was critically wounded when she was hit in the stomach by army gunfire, said a <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> surgeon. The girl died on the operating table, according to the doctor, who spoke on the condition he not be identified. Hospital officials said troops also shot and wounded three boys ranging in age from 11 to 15 and that all three were hit in the lower body. Army officials confirmed the death but said they were unable to determine the cause because the family took the girl's body from the hospital. They said an army unit sent to break up a riot in the Beach camp opened fire when Palestinians `` hurled bricks at it from a close distance.'' The army said soldiers fired at the brick throwers and it was checking to determine if the girl's death was a result of the shooting. A curfew was imposed on the Beach camp, home to about 42,000 Palestinians. According to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports, the clashes started about 6 p.m., and protests continued for several hours after the girl was killed. An Arab reporter said the body was brought back to the camp where residents marched, shouting `` <PERSON> Allahu </PERSON> akbar!'' or `` God is great!'' The fatality brought to 234 the number of Palestinians killed since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising, in which four Israelis also have died. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, an army spokesman quoted <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> as saying he lifted curfews after <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders had appealed to the army's civil administration to ease the restrictions. Right-wing Israeli settlers, who built their <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> homes in the heart of the Arab city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, warned of an escalation of violence following a bomb blast earlier in the day. The settlers told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> they might retaliate for a small, homemade bomb that caused no injuries when it exploded near a playground. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jalla </LOCATION>, hundreds of Palestinians mourned a man killed by soldiers Sunday. The mourners draped the dead man's home with outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, and chanted `` With our spirit and blood, we will avenge the martyr!'' Palestinians say <PERSON> Jeris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunkar </PERSON>, 40, was an innocent passer-by who was shot to death by troops chasing a stone-throwing group of Arab youths. The army said <PERSON> Kunkar </PERSON>, who was hit by three bullets, was shot when a soldier tripped and his gun fired accidentally. Troops stayed out of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jalla </LOCATION> during the service to reduce tensions, Israeli radio said. In the predominantly <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, police arrested three <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> citizens suspected of destroying $ 1.25 million worth of Jewish property through vandalism and arson, the <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. All of the damage was done during the Palestinian uprising, and the suspects apparently were motivated by sympathies with the Arabs in the occupied territories, <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The judiciary committee, controlled by Democrats, said it wanted to investigate the departures of <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> to determine whether operations of the department were affected by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal troubles. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said that on the morning he and <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> resigned, the criminal division chief told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>: `` Ed I do n't gainsay that there are other reasons why you might have wanted to push these two projects -LRB- a $ 32 million engine contract for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil pipeline -RRB- _ redeem the campaign pledge in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, save our cities, peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. That is not the question.'' `` The question,'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said he conveyed to the attorney general, `` is whether Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is taking official actions that he knows are going to redound to the financial benefit of his friend'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` did a lot for Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. No doubt he was front and center'' for <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> took unusual actions to advance the ends requested of him by Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. In connection with the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil pipeline project involving Swiss oilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, `` Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> within two hours of being retained by Mr. <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> calls up <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. `` There's no doubt in Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s mind about why he has been retained. Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> understands that he's been retained by Mr. <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>. Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> says ` help us with this pipeline.''' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> arranged a meeting for <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and the attorney general met briefly on the pipeline project with then-Prime Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> also commented on the $ 150,000 payment from <LOCATION> Rappaport </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s service which <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> directed be sent directly to <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, who in effect combined it with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s and other investors' money to obtain hard-to-get brand-new stock issues. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said he knew in April 1987 that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had gone to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and told the attorney general, `` I am worried about how this looks.'' According to <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s report issued earlier this month, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> `` was somewhat apprehensive that ... someone would think that there was something strange about'' the payment. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had not reported the $ 150,000 on his tax return, a fact which <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> `` apparently made no mention'' of to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> or <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, said <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s report. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` did not relay that conversation -LRB- about the disposition of the $ 150,000 -RRB- to anybody else.'' Even Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, was critical of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s relationship with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, but he placed the blame all on <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, saying `` I do n't think he was a good friend. Of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think there is a dishonest bone in his body. He was done in by his friends.'' When <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> challenged <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' assertion that morale was low in the department because of <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> replied, `` There is no way one can draw down the shade.'' `` As time went on, it became apparent to me that morale at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> was deteriorating rapidly,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said in his prepared testimony. `` I heard complaints everywhere. I heard stories of employees being embarrassed and ridiculed. One employee had to leave a party of friends when the personal abuse became intolerable. Graffiti containing obscenities appeared in the very halls of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. One <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employee was upbraided by a desk clerk at a hotel on checking in because he was associated with the <ORGANIZATION> Meese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` I say ` big deal,''' Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, responded. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> dismissed the abuse at a party and being upbraided by a desk clerk as the kind of criticism that is leveled in a time of great public controversy. Asked by Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., what they would have done had they come under criminal investigation, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said he would have `` seriously considered'' stepping aside while <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said have `` seriously thought about the leave of absence route. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said he decided last November that he would leave in January, and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said the issue first came up in a discussion between the two men in December. `` He was more concerned than I at the outset'' about problems the probe of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was causing the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said. `` In the end, I passed'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> `` on the outside lane'' in terms of concern leading to a decision to resign. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said he discussed resignation with Solicitor General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON>, the department's No. 4 official, the day before <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>'s departure. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> agreed with a characterization by <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> that he `` planted'' the idea of resigning with Fried, but said he did not suggest it. Regarding their decision to resign the same day, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> were `` trying to steer a middle course'' between leaving silently and holding a news conference on the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> steps announcing they were quitting in protest. The two remained silent about their reasons for resigning until the judiciary committee session. Regarding the early April meeting in which he urged <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to distance himself from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said the attorney general told him that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> `` is going to be in my office tomorrow morning'' returning from overseas. `` I do n't know if Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> did or he did n't'' meet with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> subsequently, said <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. Because he felt there were obvious violations of ethics regulations, `` I would have taken a hike whether or not I felt it was over the line,'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said of his resignation. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> called the Arpil White House discussion with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` a fairly grim meeting'' while <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said `` things were very frank and very candid in the extreme.'' When Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, questioned <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> about who might have leaked the substance of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the day after it occurred, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> responded, `` I did nothing'' and insisted he `` did everything to prevent it.'' When pressed about leaking details of private conversations with the president, he responded, `` Twer n't me.''

Major opposition parties merged into the <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to defeat the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in general elections in 1977, but the government served only two years of its five-year term. The Parliament dissolved in 1979 after the coalition split and bickered over the choice for prime minister. <PERSON> Patnaik </PERSON> said the leadership of the new party has not been decided. The four parties control only two of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 25 state assemblies _ northern <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Karnataka </LOCATION> _ and their members hold just 21 seats in the 544-member law-making lower house of Parliament. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> holds more than 400 seats in the lower house, but its fortunes have been declining since it swept to victory in the 1984 general elections. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has lost 10 of 14 state elections held since then. It also lost four of the seven <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> seats in the by-elections. Much of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s decline has been blamed on allegations of inefficiency and corruption in government. News media and opposition politicans have alleged that kickbacks were paid on major defense contracts and that some money may have gone to <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> allies. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has denied that.

 A prison inmate was sentenced to 10 years in prison for stabbing another prisoner with a steak bone, and as a result of the attack inmates in solitary confinement do n't eat T-bone steaks any more A Union County jury Monday convicted <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> of aggravated assault and possession of contraband in the Nov. 11, 1987, stabbing of <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Raiford </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> was sentenced to 10 years for each conviction. The sentences will be served concurrently. <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> was stabbed with the sharpened bone from a T-bone steak that had been served the previous night to <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> and other inmates in solitary confinement, according to court testimony. <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> was stabbed in his back and leg and was treated at a hospital. Sgt. M.S. <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON>, who witnessed the attack, testified in the trial that T-bone steaks should not have been served to inmates confined for disciplinary reasons. `` It was an oversight, passing this kind of bone on to confinement inmates,'' he said. As a result of the attack, the Corrections Department implemented a new policy that prohibits T-bone steaks and pork chops with bones from being served to inmates in solitary confinement, said <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Tully </PERSON>, a department spokeswoman. Food service policy did not previously specify cuts of meat that should not be served. Steaks are served to inmates once every six weeks, she said. <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> claimed he stabbed <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> in self defense after the inmate threatened him and swung a razor blade at him in an exercise area. <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> said he found the bone on the ground as <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> approached. He is currently serving a 15-year sentence for trafficking in cocaine. According to <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> records, <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> entered prison on Dec. 31, 1986. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Roney </PERSON>, a deputy court clerk in <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> will not begin serving the new sentences until he completes his current term.

 One of 22 people charged with running the largest Asian-based marijuana ring ever uncovered appeared in court Tuesday for a hearing to expedite his extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> police force, identified the prisoner as <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chueun </PERSON> <PERSON> Lo </PERSON>, a 29-year-old travel agent. Neither <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard nor the court would give Lo's nationality or the identity of three other men arrested in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> Monday On the Spanish Mediterranean island of <LOCATION> Majorca </LOCATION>, three Britons, including one man described by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities as `` the <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Polo </PERSON> of drug trafficking,'' were jailed Tuesday following their arrest on similar charges. They were among 22 people indicted Monday by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The three in <LOCATION> Majorca </LOCATION> were identified as <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, 43, his wife, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, 34, and <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenion </PERSON>, 46. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said the ring was led by Marks, an <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate who in the past claimed to be an agent for MI6, the British counterintelligence agency. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said the group shipped marijuana from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and hashish from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and operated in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nations. The authorities said the group amassed $ 30 million worth of property that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government wants confiscated. Police agencies from many of the countries involved participated in the investigation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities called it the largest Asian-based drug ring ever uncovered. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the jailer's office at Bow Street magistrate's court said Lo, whose arrest warrant claims he was importing hashish into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> between 1980 and 1988, had been remanded in custody until Aug. 2. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said that British police are still seeking one other man, and that the three in custody in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> are being interviewed prior to being charged. Marks reportedly told a British court following a 1974 arrest on drug charges that he had been involved in smuggling while trying to infiltrate the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> for British intelligence. He was acquitted. Marks, his wife and <PERSON> Kenion </PERSON> had been living on <LOCATION> Majorca </LOCATION>, said officials in the island city of <LOCATION> Palma </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> Majorca </LOCATION> police spokesman, who would not give his name in keeping with <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> custom, said it was expected the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request for extradition would be made and acted upon within the legal limit of 80 days. The police spokesman also described as `` lies'' news reports that <LOCATION> Palma </LOCATION> police had arrested a suspected <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> activist named <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> along with the Marks and <PERSON> Kenion </PERSON>. Six people meanwhile remained in custody Tuesday after police discovered a cache of 17 tons of hashish in a tunnel north of <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> on Sunday. It was the biggest drug bust in the country's history

 Officials at the overcrowded <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> isolated 36 inmates Tuesday who had participated in a disturbance that injured 12 people, but they still do n't know why the violence erupted. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the secretary of public safety who is heading the investigation of the riot, said officials identified the inmates who took part and isolated them in the south wing of the downtown, maximum-security prison. There is no indication that inmates had planned the uprising, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. Inmates remained locked in their cells one day after prisoners attacked guards within a recreation yard and a crisis clinic and a minor fire was set in the clinic. No one escaped during Monday's riot and authorities restored order in about an hour Three guards and three inmates remained hospitalized Tuesday, but none was in serious condition. One of the guards and all three inmates had suffered gunshot wounds. `` The only guns found were those used by the officers, but we wo n't know for sure -LRB- where the wounding shots came from -RRB- until ballistics checks are in,'' said <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Marable </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Division of Correction. The violence broke out shortly after a group of prisoners had a regular meeting with wardens to discuss grievances, Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- The warden -RRB- said he was not able to give them possibly the answers that they wanted,'' <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said. Prison officials said they did not know what caused the violence, though. `` The investigation is n't complete enough to be specific as to who the primary instigators were,'' Ms. <PERSON> Marable </PERSON> said. Officials are interviewing guards and inmates, she said. The prison, the nation's second oldest, was built in 1811 and is designed to hold 700 to 800 inmates. It has been chronically overcrowded, though, and held 1,270 on Monday. Former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> described conditions there in 1984 as `` the innermost circle of hell in the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> prison system.'' The prison is slated to be torn down in several years, and a new maximum security prison built elsewhere. Guard <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, 23, was listed in fair condition at <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with two fractured elbows, a broken hand, head and eye injuries and lacerations, hospital officials said. At <ORGANIZATION> Mercy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, guard <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, 29, was in fair condition with a gunshot wound to the neck, and guard <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Biddle </PERSON>, 50, was in satisfactory condition with stab wounds and head injuries. Inmate <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughly </PERSON>, 22, was listed in fair condition at <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> with gunshot wounds in the head and neck, and inmate <PERSON> Wymann </PERSON> <PERSON> Ushry </PERSON>, 25, was in fair condition with a gunshot wound in the head. Another unidentified inmate remained in the prison hospital with a gunshot wound in the foot. Officials did not release his condition.

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> slammed <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday for taking a `` do-nothing'' approach to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal difficulties. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said if he wins the White House he will hold officials to an `` exacting code of conduct.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who formally won the Democratic presidential nomination last week, also criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for not trying to block the arms-for-hostages deal at the center of the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who receives the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination at the Republican National Convention next month, said that civil penalties as well as criminal sanctions should be used to punish ethical violations by government officials. He said conflict of interest laws should be broadened to include <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Departing from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also endorsed the use of independent counsels to investigate wrongdoing. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, boosted by the positive reaction from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, led <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 17 points in the latest Gallup poll of 1,001 registered voters conducted Friday through Saturday. The survey, reported Tuesday by radio station <ORGANIZATION> WEEI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, found <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 54 percent support to 37 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The poll reflected the frequent bounce enjoyed by presidential candidates after their nominating conventions. Nine percent were undecided in the survey, which had a margin of error of 4 percent. The two would-be presidents debated ethics long distance as the current occupant of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> told reporters that the rhetoric at last week's Democratic National Convention got `` my Irish up.'' `` To hear the opposition talk, you would think growth in our economy had come to a dead halt,'' said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Republicans were at work readying the Superdome for next month's national convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was settling back to normal after last week's invasion of the Democrats Security officials said the lost and found bins in the Democratic convention city were overflowing with items such as a woman's silk suit, eyeglasses, keys, watches and wallets. They said anything unclaimed after 90 days would be turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> voted to release $ 46 million in federal campaign funds that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is entitled to as the Democratic nominee. The 6-0 vote came despite objections from a Republican group complaining about <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s dual campaigns as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' vice presidential running mate and as a senator seeking re-election from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> tended to his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> duties, chairing a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at which legislation was approved to correct errors in the landmark 1986 tax overhaul bill. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his nomination secure for early next month, proposed rewriting conflict of interest rules that govern federal employees to cover a wider variety of misconduct, and he said members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should be covered by the law. `` Those who take on the people's trust must hold themselves to an exacting code of conduct. We can expect, and indeed, tolerate nothing less from the people who work for the government,'' he said in a speech before congressional interns at the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He said he would establish a new office, senior counselor to the president, whose first responsibility would be ethics issues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> complained that the present system of federal ethics law `` is a confused quiltwork of executive policy statements, administrative regulations, criminal laws. Indeed, virtually every agency of government issues its own set of standards of conduct.'' It was the second time in several days that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has tried to ease a campaign problem. Democrats have long campaigned against the alleged `` sleaze'' of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, and the vice president's ethics speech seemed designed to reassure the voters on that score. Over the weekend, in a proposal widely viewed as an attempt to increase his appeal to female voters, he called for giving tax breaks to low-income mothers to help pay for child care. He said he did n't intend to discuss ethical questions about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, he said the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people `` are embarrassed and ashamed by some of the things that they see'' in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, including the handling of misconduct allegations against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should have asked for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s resignation and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should have demanded his ouster immediately after two former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials told the president and vice president in April that they believed <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had violated the law. `` I hope I never have a briefing like the one Mr. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> gave the Vice President three months ago,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` But if I do, I wo n't sit there and do nothing.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> referred to former Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, who told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier in the day they briefed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in April. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> testified that he thought <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had probably committed felonies while in office, although independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said earlier this month he would not seek a criminal indictment. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, contending the McKay report vindicated him, has announced plans to resign. On another topic, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denied reports that he plans to resign as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor to pursue his quest for the White House. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who contested the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nomination until last week, met with aides in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to map out the next phase of his involvement in the campaign. `` Fundamentally it was about pulling everyone together to kind of wrap up the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention, to sort things out, to lay out our basic plan and the various tracks,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s longtime aide <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the transition of some <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aides to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign was discussed, but said no specifics about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s role had yet been decided.

Energy Department officials testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committe </ORGANIZATION>'s energy and water development subcommittee offered no clues as to what the department will recommend, but various members of the committee tried to put their own spin on what an advisory panel's report had found. `` We should not gamble with the nation's security and go with an unproven technology,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, adding that the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> complex in his state long had been involved in producing materials for nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> facetiously suggested that the ideal solution was to build two new production reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, one in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and convert a mothballed plant at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. `` But I question whether we have the money,'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> took note of the split in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state congressional delegation over whether to convert the mothballed plant. `` One senator says we should and another says we should n't,'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Republican Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> supports the conversion proposal and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> opposes it. Neither are members of the appropriations committee. DOE is scheduled to unveil by the end of the month its recommendation on where to locate the new production reactor and what technology to use. Possible sites for the multibillion-dollar reactor, which would produce tritium, include the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> complex near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> reservation in southcentral <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. A report from an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> advisory panel, while making no recommendations, concluded that construction of a new heavy-water reactor at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> offered the `` best chance'' of ensuring a steady supply of tritium, a key radioactive ingredient in nuclear weapons. The report, however, did not completely rule out any of the other options, including converting a mothballed <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> nuclear plant at the Hanford reservation. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, said he had no objection to building a new production reactor at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, but urged that at least one more be built at a different location to avoid putting `` all our eggs in one basket.'' <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said building only one reactor at one site could expose `` our national security unecessarily to events that can bring us to our knees in terms of nuclear deterrence capabilities `` Whether it's an act of God, a terrorist attack, an unfortuante safety concern or an unanticipated design flaw, we could find ourselves without any production capability if we select only one site or one technology.'' <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said his chief concern was national security and if a site other than <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> was selected it would be `` fine with me. `` My goal is n't simply to get a reactor built in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Republican Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, who opposes conversion of the nuclear plant at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, said he thought conversion would violate nuclear non-proliferation laws as it would involve using a civilian reactor for defense purposes. `` I'm deeply concerned about the implications,'' <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said. The nation's three existing defense production reactors, located at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, have been operating at less than 50 percent of full power because of safety concerns.

 There are `` significant problems and limitations'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s fledgling try-before-you-buy program, as evidenced by flawed planning and testing of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Aegis air defense system and five other major weapons, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday The five-year-old program, ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, still is `` not adequate to assess'' whether the weapons will work in combat, the congressional watchdog agency reported. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> review centered on the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Operational Test and Evaluation, which is headed by <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Krings </PERSON>, a former lobbyist for <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>. It was the second time in two years the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> had criticized the operation of the office. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> created the office in 1983 as part of an effort to do a more realistic job of testing weapons. The legislation was triggered by the discovery of serious flaws in several major weapons systems after they were well into development. Among those weapons were the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION>, which has been plagued with problems, and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sergeant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> gun, which was canceled because of poor performance, but not until more than $ 1.5 billion had been spent on it. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> review looked at the testing of six new major weapons, including the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Aegis air defense, the sophisticated tracking system that was involved in the July 3 shootdown by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> of an Iranian jetliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The Pentagon says the shootdown was a case of mistaken identity. The other weapons reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> included the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Aquila </ORGANIZATION> drone plane; The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s helicopter improvement program; <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Tomahawk conventional cruise missile; the newest targeting system for the Air Force Maverick missile; and the Air Force LANTIRN system for night-time targeting. `` We found significant problems and limitations in the planning, execution, realism, analysis, and service test agency reporting of the six'' programs, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Some of these problems are limitations were unavoidable due to time, resource or safety constraints, although numerous others were not,'' it said. The report was released by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, a group of 140 legislators created to seek Pentagon management changes. Members of the caucus told a news conference that <PERSON> Krings </PERSON> should quit. `` It's time for Mr. <PERSON> Krings </PERSON> to resign,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Ore., `` the sooner the better. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said `` I have n't seen the report. It is my understanding that <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> was instructed not to contact DOD for its views on the matter. So we will have to wait and see.'' `` I have a comment in general terms,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> added. `` I have seen several of these stories recently put out by certain congressmen ... The difficulty is that those who do not wish to inform themselves, who very carefully guard their ignorance, obviously are not going to learn about the details of our testing programs. `` The stories attacking the Aegis system that I saw in the press by and large were four-year-old stories. They were based on an earlier phase of the Aegis testing program, in 1983, and subsequent to those tests and those reports, an additional $ 30 million worth of testing was done on <PERSON> Aegis </PERSON> and it performed magnificently in those tests.'' Other Pentagon comment came from spokeswoman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodanyi </PERSON>, who said `` this attack on Mr. <PERSON> Krings </PERSON> is inappropriate and unjustified. ... We feel that Mr. <PERSON> Krings </PERSON> is successfully carrying out the responsibilities of his office.'' Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said, `` we need a back-to-basics approach to weapons testing Approving a weapon that does n't work is like graduating a high school student who ca n't read. It's easy, but it hurts everybody.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had ordered that testing be as realistic and close to combat-type conditions as possible, but that was n't done, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. For example, `` the prevailing problem for operational users was that they were selected from an operator pool that was atypically high in skill or experience level _ that is, so-called ` golden crews,''' the review said. Another example cited was the fact that in some case, contractors were permitted to help military crews maintain the weapons `` although that contractor support would not be available in the field,'' it said. When the test data was available, it was often wrongly interpreted, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` In five of six cases, we found problems with the various assumptions underlying the analyses of the test data,'' it said. `` In at least two cases, such assumptions led to overly optimistic estimates of the system's capability, one of which was contracted by available data.'' There were other `` questionable practices'' in interpreting data and their impact `` was significant,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` They frequently allowed a system to appear to meet its performance requirements.'' Among the flaws cited by the report was the fact that crews used for both the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopter tests and Maverick tests were specifically trained for the tests, rather than being normal crews; and tests of the Tomahawk occurred only over pre-tested fight routes.

<HEAD>Teen-Ager Fights Brain Cancer With Innovative Treatment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A teen-ager fighting the most malignant type of brain tumor is being treated with a relatively new technique that involves inserting tubes and radioactive beads into his head. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 18, was a week away from graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Wolbach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> this spring when he suffered a seizure. Doctors found he had a brain tumor just under 2 inches in diameter. Dr. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shewe </PERSON>, a radiation oncologist at <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Clarkson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said standard therapy for the fast-growing tumor is surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy, but the average patient survives only 40 to 50 weeks. About 20 percent of patients live two years; none has survived five. The new procedure combines surgery, chemotherapy and external and internal radiation, and doctors hope it will increase <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s survival rate. Preliminary tests on the newer treatment indicated the median survival time for patients has been extended to 87 weeks, <PERSON> Shewe </PERSON> said. The treatment is a five-step process, <PERSON> Shewe </PERSON> said. The first involves completing in three weeks rather than six the external radiation given before surgery. The compact treatment time may increase the effectiveness, <PERSON> Shewe </PERSON> said. The second step, chemotherapy, takes place concurrently, the doctor said. Step three is surgery to remove the tumor. Step four for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> began when tiny radioactive beads were inserted through his scalp and into the center and around the tumor site to attack any remaining tumor cells, doctors said. The procedure utilizes sophisticated imaging equipment that shows cross-sections of the brain and a computer that helps plot the precise location of the tumor site. Neurosurgeon <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> drilled seven tiny holes in the skull and inserted seven tubes, or catheters, each less than a tenth of an inch in diameter. Each of the tubes was glued to a tiny button sewn to the scalp to hold it in place. A brain scan ensured the catheters were correctly positioned, and <PERSON> Shewe </PERSON> then inserted the radioactive beads. The radioactive materials remain at the tumor site for 96 hours before being removed. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> is scheduled to go home this week. He'll return for chemotherapy once every six weeks for a year, the fifth step in the therapy. Use of the implant began in 1977. In 1980, doctors first used the insertable catheter tubes with removable caps. And in 1983, at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, doctors began to use the implants to treat patients with so-called `` high-grade tumors.''

 Weary negotiators went home to sleep Tuesday after 20 hours of talks and a mediator's deadline failed to produce a settlement in the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> strike that has crippled <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> broke off talks about 11 a.m. Tuesday. The talks, which featured two federal mediators, had begun at 3 p.m. the day before. One of the mediators, <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, district director for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said no new sessions were scheduled. He declined to discuss what had happened in the talks or characterize them in any way. On Monday, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> had set a midnight deadline for an end to the talks, but declined to say what he would do if the no settlement was reached by that time. When the hour came, he extended the deadline. The series of talks that began Saturday were the first between full bargaining teams for both sides in a month. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Reisman </PERSON>, co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION>'s negotiating committee, said Tuesday that he was neither `` discouraged nor encouraged'' by the contract talks. The <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> strike, which began March 7, is now entering its 21st week. Both sides in the strike have been asked by a federal mediator to maintain a news blackout, and detailed information about the bargaining sessions has been scant. But a source familiar with the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were some signs of progress Tuesday. The source indicated that the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> and the producers had begun to address in earnest the divisive issue of television residual payments. Throughout the protracted strike, which has led to sweeping layoffs in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, the writers and the producers have disagreed sharply over payments for one-hour television shows rebroadcast domestically and all television programs rebroadcast overseas. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, said the talks had left him drained, and that he was going home to sleep. The union said it was proceeding with plans to picket the offices of television producer <LOCATION> Aaron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spelling </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> studios Wednesday. Meanwhile, a collection of some of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s top writers are taking out full-page advertisements in Wednesday's issues of entertainment industry newspapers in a show of support for guild leaders. The advertisement is signed by 150 writers, directors and producers, including makers of the television shows `` Family Ties,'' `` Cheers'' and `` thirtysomething,'' and the films `` Down and Out in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>'' and `` Sunset Boulevard.'' It is being published in response to actions by a group of dissident writers who are threatening to resign from the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> if the strike is not ended immediately. `` I signed the ad because I was afraid that the producers alliance might be waiting to see what the fallout would be, who would break ranks,'' said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, a creator of the `` <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show.'' `` The alliance should n't count on anyone breaking ranks.'' <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chetwynd </PERSON>, a spokesman for the dissident group, the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, dismissed the advertisement Tuesday. And he said his group feared that the recess of negotiations may mean that contract talks have collapsed. `` We're very pessimistic,'' <PERSON> Chetwynd </PERSON> said. `` We are horrified that after all these talks, they ca n't close a deal.''

<HEAD>House OKs Measure To Protect Atlantic Striped Bass</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agreed on Tuesday to extend a law that proponents say has reversed a severe decline in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> striped bass over a 12-state region. Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and Fisheries subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife, said the striped bass is `` making a strong comeback'' because of the 1984 law The Studds legislation, which passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on a voice vote, would extend the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> Striped Bass Conservation Act and an emergency striped base study for three more years. `` There are encouraging signs in some areas that the stocks may be on the road to recovery, but the act must be reauthorized to assure that the recovery continues,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The law allows the 12 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> states from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, plus the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, to create and monitor their own striped bass conservation programs, but the states must comply with guidelines set by the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Under the statute, the federal government can declare a moratorium on all striped bass fishing in states that do not comply. The states have complied and no moratorium has been declared. Dramatic declines in striped bass were seen in the late 1970s, spurring the original congressional action. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration supports extension of the conservation act, but not the striped bass study. The legislation would cost an estimated $ 5 million through fiscal year 1991. A similar measure is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on environmental protection. The House also passed on a voice vote another committee bill that would make several changes to the national marine sanctuaries program. The measure by Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>, D-Wash., chairman of the oceanography subcommittee, would speed up the government's procedures for designating new Only seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coastal areas have received the designation _ and the accompanying special federal protections _ since the law was enacted 1972.

<HEAD>Woman Surrenders After Holding Sports Psychologist Hostage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman with a target pistol held top sports psychologist <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> hostage for nearly 2 -LCB- hours Tuesday and about six shots were fired before she released him unharmed and surrendered, police said. The siege took place at the <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sport </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> holds consultations. The Australian psychologist works closely with many of this nation's leading athletes, including former Wimbledon tennis champion <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON>. The woman was reported to be a member of the Australian pistol shooting team, but police would not confirm that. Police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON> said police would question the woman, who was not identified. <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON> said he did not know if she had been dropped from the Australian Olympic shooting team, as local radio stations reported. Public relations officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Purnell </PERSON> said the woman, a shooter and part-time student studying for a Ph.D., went to consult <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> at the institute's <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> late Tuesday afternoon. <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON> said that a short time later, the psychologist called in a doctor because `` a difficult situation was developing.'' The police spokesman said a shot was fired, apparently from the target pistol the woman had taken with her, and the doctor ran from the room and called police. <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON> said he believed up to five more shots were fired. The area was evacuated during the siege, while <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> was held captive. The woman made only one demand, asking for a hot meal. About 30 police were at the scene and set up road blocks. `` The main thing is that everyone is out safely,'' <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON> said when the crisis ended. Bond is widely credited with having been a major figure behind the scenes in Cash's men's singles triumph at the 1987 Wimbledon championships. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> was with Cash in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> when the player lost at <LOCATION> Wimbledon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobson </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said about 300 athletes now are active at the institute, with an additional 170 administrators, coaches and staff.

 A woman whose legs were crushed when a construction crane collapsed on her and whose bravery during the rescue won the nation's admiration will collect nearly $ 10 million for the injuries she suffered. <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerney </PERSON> will receive $ 1 million immediately, $ 27,625 a month for a year, then the same monthly payment for the rest of her life with a compounded 3 percent increase each year, it was announced Tuesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Gerney </PERSON>, 52, was injured in May 1985 when a 35-ton crane, operated by an unlicensed worker, fell on her legs as she passed a site where a 42-story apartment house was being built. She told of the pain she went through when she testified at the trial of <PERSON> Lino </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmieri </PERSON>, the site foreman, and <ORGANIZATION> Crimmins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the company <PERSON> Palmieri </PERSON> worked for. `` I heard all the bones cracking,'' she said. `` I screamed for help. ` Help me! Help me! Get me out!''' She said she lay beneath the crane for six hours, in agony and with her legs crushed, while Detective <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragonese </PERSON> pleaded with her to hang on to life. The payment, which settles a lawsuit filed by Mrs. <PERSON> Gerney </PERSON> against <PERSON> Crimmins </PERSON> and a number of other defendants, was reached after a session Monday in the courtroom of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trial judge, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saxe </PERSON>. The judge offered guidance to the participants but did not hold a formal hearing. The money is to be paid to Mrs. <PERSON> Gerney </PERSON> through an annuity the defendants are setting up with an insurance company. The defendants in the lawsuit include the city, <PERSON> Crimmins </PERSON>, and several other construction-related companies. The suit was filed shortly after the criminal case ended in spring 1986. <PERSON> Palmieri </PERSON>, 54, was fined $ 5,000, put on five years' probation and ordered to perform community service for allowing an unqualified person, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricciardi </PERSON>, to operate the crane. Crimmins Construction was fined $ 10,000. <PERSON> Ricciardi </PERSON>, 31, pleaded guilty to second-degree assault, was sentenced to a few months in jail and was placed on probation. Mrs. <PERSON> Gerney </PERSON> underwent at least seven operations on her legs. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called her during her recovery and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visited. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> threw a party for her. The settlement said that in the event of Mrs. <PERSON> Gerney </PERSON>'s death, her estate will receive the money for a minimum of 20 years. The total for a 20-year period would be $ 9,906,738. Her life expectancy is 29 years, said her lawyer, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Conason </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gerney </PERSON> could not be reached for comment and <PERSON> Conason </PERSON> would not disclose her whereabouts. `` She's a very private person,'' he said. `` She instructed us to say nothing.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it has written South African President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> protesting his nation's plan to require the registration of journalists. The institute, which has about 2,000 journalists, editors and publishers among its members, said the step increases the South African government's `` already deplorable degree of control over the media.'' <ORGANIZATION> IPI </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Galliner </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to withdraw the `` repressive'' policy saying it would `` allow the government to have ultimate control over who may practice as a journalist.'' Under regulations published June 10 by the South African government, anyone carrying out `` news agency'' business must be registered with the government beginning July 31 or face a 10-year prison term or a $ 10,000 fine.

<TEXT>
 Mine workers and the government held negotiations Tuesday aimed at ending a nationwide strike affecting <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s silver production, officials said. No progress was immediately reported. The National Federation of Mine, <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the first negotiations since the strike began July 18 were held Monday and Tuesday. The federation, which claims to represent 75 percent of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s estimated 80,000 to 100,000 mine workers, said strikers are demanding that all labor contracts for individual unions be negotiated jointly The federation said more than 90 percent of the mining industry has been paralyzed by the strike. Industry analysts, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the figure was closer to 60 percent. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is the world's second leading producer of silver behind <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and a major source of copper, lead, zinc and gold. Mining traditionally accounts for half of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s exports. The government said last week it would not sign new sales contracts for state-controlled silver, about 42 percent of the nation's annual output of 60 million ounces, in an effort to boost its dwindling foreign reserves. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s decision to boost its dwindling reserves is part of an effort to secure credits to combat consumer shortages and help the economy by importing food and capital goods. The government hopes to use its silver reserves as security to finance up to $ 600 million in import credits, the official gazette <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peruano </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday.

 A property tax bill completed its stormy passage through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> backed down from threats to amend it. The House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, decided without a vote to not act on some members's demands that changes be made in the measure. Opponents of the bill said the proposed flat-rate community tax is unfair to the poor. `` The government themselves are likely to come to regret today's decision,'' said <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Abbeydale </LOCATION> The bill is expected to be approved later this week by Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> pledged in the 1987 election campaign to revise the system of local property taxes known as the `` rates'' that help finance local governments. Advocates of the new plan said the old rates system was unfair because the burden was not shared equally, falling on local businesses and some householders while other people paid nothing. The new measure will replace the rates with a flat-rate system of payments. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government calls the new system a community charge to be paid by almost everyone. Critics said it will especially hurt the poor because, unlike a graduated income tax, it takes no account of a person's ability to pay. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> withdrew its challenge to the measure in the face of a constitutional clash with the elected <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. The Commons approved the proposal in April. The House of Lords has no power to interfere with the government's taxation legislation but can delay enactment of other laws for up to 13 months. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> who wanted to ammend the tax measure said the bill did not come under the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>' `` financial privilege'' because it affected local government `` Though we should respect Commons financial privilege with the greatest care, we should also respect our own privileges and feelings and should not allow them to be eroded or diminished,'' said <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brompton </LOCATION> during the debate that lasted nearly three hours. But Lord <PERSON> Hailsham </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> always had claimed privileges when introducing general taxes. `` It is the duty of any -LRB- government -RRB- minister to insist on privilege and give no further reasons'' for rejecting amendments by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION>, he said.

 Deposed <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> on Tuesday denied a newspaper report that he offered the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government $ 5 billion to allow him to return to his homeland without fear of criminal prosecution. `` My going home depends on principle, not cash,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said. `` Yes, negotiations are going on, as they have for the past several months, but money is not involved.'' Later, through a spokesman, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> indicated he would n't discuss details of the negotiations, on the advice of his attorney. He said he had records that could prove he did n't offer any money. A professor quoted in the story published by the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday also said it was inaccurate. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON>, political science professor and <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> expert at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as saying <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> offered to return $ 5 billion to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, support President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and stay out of politics to ensure his return to his home province of <ORGANIZATION> Ilocos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION>. `` I heard that figure second - or third-hand during a meeting with a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> official,'' <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> said `` I have no direct knowledge of money being offered by anyone. I have heard figures, but indirectly, ranging from $ 250 million to $ 20 billion.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, the night news editor in the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau who edited the story, stood by the report. `` It accurately reflects what we were told by him -LRB- <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> -RRB- and other sources,'' he said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been living in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since he was deposed in February 1986. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is trying to recoup billions of dollars <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> allegedly siphoned out of the country during his reign. <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> said Tuesday he met in June in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as well as <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> to discuss ways to negotiate <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' return. It was during a meeting that included <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> that money was mentioned, he said. <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> said he advised <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> officials against indicting <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because it would set a dangerous precedent for future political exiles. Instead, he suggested that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> be allowed to return to his homeland as long as he promised he and his family would stay out of politics. <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> sent the suggestion to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> even though he favors prosecuting <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for allegedly taking funds from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> said he saw one document during the negotiations that was addressed to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and signed by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general met twice with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister Tuesday in the first formal round of talks to put a cease-fire into effect in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq War. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said after the first afternoon meeting with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that the talks were `` constructive and fruitful'' and covered the steps to carry out a truce and peace plan. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has said he hopes next week he can announce the dates for a cease-fire. `` We are trying to set a timetable for the implementation plan of the secretary-general and we also talked about the recent escalation of the war on our border with the Iraqis,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told reporters at the end of second talks Tuesday night. `` We said -LRB- to the secretary-general -RRB- that if they continue their attack, we will give them a lesson that they wo n't forget,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> is to hold separate talks with <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> on Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief said he dispensed with formalities and begin intensive peace talks Tuesday, one day ahead of schedule, because the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> envoy already had arrived. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Monday and <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> arrived Tuesday. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> did not make an arrival statement. Before meeting with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was trying to sabotage the peace process by invading <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and using chemical wapons on a large scale. `` The war is still going on very seriously,'' he said, despite <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s statements it was withdrawing from Iranian territory. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to exercise maximum restraint, saying, `` Continuation of fighting does nothing to enhance the common goal of a negotiated settlement.'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> discussed implementation of Security Council Resolution 598, which was passed unanimously on July 20, 1987, and which demands an immediate cease-fire in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> conflict. It also calls for withdrawal to recognized borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an investigation to determine which side started the war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> quickly accepted the resolution last year on condition <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> do the same, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> waited until last week, July 18, before announcing its acceptance. Although <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> asked for direct talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he would not try to compel the two sides to meet face to face initially. While talks were under way in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, two <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> teams were at work in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the Iranian capital. One was laboring over truce details and the other was inquiring into the prisoners-of-war situation. The cease-fire would be monitored and supervised by about 250 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping troops. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television program `` This Morning'' that it would be possible to work out a cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the next two months. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget crisis will make it hard, perhaps impossible to finance the peacekeeping force, unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other debtors pay their arrears. Such a force could cost $ 20 million to $ 30 million a year, according to early estimates. <PERSON> Francoic </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, spokesman for the secretary-general, told reporters Tuesday the organization is expected to run out of operating funds at the end of October. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been withholding full dues payments to demand <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spending reforms.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, in a letter released Tuesday, said it would consider participating in the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> but repeated its demand to be a co-host of the event that begins in September. The letter, which came as a suprise to South Korean leaders, linked negotiations on the Olympics with an earlier <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> proposal that the two countries hold parliamentary talks on a non-aggression pact. It said in part, `` We propose with courtesy that the scheduled North-South joint parliamentary conference be held within August at the latest before the opening of the Olympics and discuss as an urgent agenda such issues as your request for our participation in the Olympics and our proposal for its co-hosting.'' There was no immediate comment from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government, which has not yet responded to the earlier North Korean letter calling for parliamentary talks. The peninsula was divided into communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and capitalist <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1945 at the end of World War II. They fought a war in 1950-53 and remain enemies. The Olympic Games are to be held Sept. 17-Oct. 2 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> When <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s demand that it be a co-host of the games was rejected it announced a boycott. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> have said some events could be held in the <PERSON> North </PERSON>, but that the Games are awarded to a single host city and not to countries. The committee has said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> could stage archery, table tennis, women's volleyball, preliminary soccer games and a cycling road race. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> insisted on more, including its own opening and closing ceremonies in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, the capital, and a share of television revenue. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympic officials have said the invitation to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to participate would remain open until the last possible minute in hopes of promoting North-South reconciliation. Aides to <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chae-sun </PERSON>, speaker of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said the new letter was from <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyong </PERSON> <PERSON> Sop </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>.

 Ten postal workers were charged Tuesday with dumping nearly 60,000 pieces of mail into a trash bin behind a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> post office. The workers threw away 59,700 pieces of mail between April and June, according to a complaint filed in federal court in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. In at least one instance, a supervisor was standing nearby as the mail was dumped, officials charged. Most of the discarded mail was bulk mail but about 5 percent was second-class magazines and newspapers, the complaint said. Sixty first-class letters also were thrown out. The mail carriers, many of them in uniform, were released on their own recognizance after a brief appearance before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caden </PERSON>. The Postal Inspection Service began investigating after receiving information that carrier <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Slikas </PERSON> had thrown the contents of a mailbag into a trash bin behind a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> post office April 6. Postal officials found 51 pieces of mail in the bin, the complaint said. From April 11 to 19, an informant saw <PERSON> Slikas </PERSON> allegedly dump more mail. Postal officials digging through the bin found mail that should have been delivered by <PERSON> Slikas </PERSON> and other carriers, the complaint alleges. On May 17, postal inspectors secretly placed a video camera in the rear vestibule of the post office near the trash bin. Between May 18 and June 21, the camera recorded <PERSON> Slikas </PERSON> and nine other carriers dumping mail there, the complaint alleged. The 11th defendant, post office superintendent <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, allegedly stood near the trash bin as the carriers tossed in mail, the complaint said. Conviction on the charge of destroying mail carries a possible six-month prison sentence and $ 500 fine.

 Former President <PERSON> Leopoldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> and two top commanders jailed by a military court after the 1982 Falklands War appeared before a civilian appeals court Tuesday trying to get their sentences overturned. However, Federal Prosecutor <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> asked the court for stiffer punishment for Gen. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>; Adm. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> chief, and Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Basilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lami </PERSON> <PERSON> Dozo </PERSON>, former chief of the armed forces. <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lami </PERSON> <PERSON> Dozo </PERSON> comprised the ruling junta at the outbreak of the Falklands War. All three now are serving sentences in military prison. They wore their military uniforms in court Tuesday. Although stripped of their ranks by the military court, they were allowed to keep the ranks pending a final ruling by the civilian appeals court. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> also asked the court to convict three other high-ranking officers who were absolved in May 1986 by the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's highest military tribunal. The trial, expected to last about three weeks, recessed Tuesday and will resume Wednesday. At issue is the conduct of the 74-day war, which <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> initiated with an April invasion. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> retook the disputed archipelago off <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s southern coast in June 1982. It has claimed possession of the remote, sparsely populated colony in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> since 1833. A military inquiry later found Argentine soldiers were poorly trained, equipped and led. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s death toll in the Falklands War was 712, compared to 255 for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The debacle followed the decline of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s economy during nearly eight years of military rule. It forced the army to retire from political power and led to the election of <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> as civilian president in 1983. The three appealed their convictions and sentences _ 12 years for <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON>, 14 for <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>, eight for <PERSON> Lami </PERSON> <PERSON> Dozo </PERSON>. Under Argentine law, an appeal by the prosecutor is mandatory, and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> can reconsider acquittals as well as convictions. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> lodged charges against three other high-ranking officials who were among 13 acquitted by the military court _ <PERSON> Gens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Parada </PERSON> and Vice Adm. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombardo </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> said Tuesday that Soviet relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have reached a postwar high but that greater cooperation between the countries is `` absolutely essential'' to bring about disarmament. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>'s remarks came during a meeting with Sir <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartledge </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> ambassador, who is leaving <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> after three years. A report on the meeting was distributed by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Cartledge </PERSON> noted that trade and economic ties between <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had been broadening during his stay in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and relations had improved. `` From the point of view of the Soviet side, too, our relations have grown richer,'' <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> said. `` Never before in the postwar period have they been at such a level as now. But even this level can and should be raised further.'' <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, who served as foreign minister for 28 years, said differences remained between the countries, in the first place over nuclear weapons. <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has proposed a three-stage plan to scrap all nuclear arms by the year 2000.

He said British support played a `` positive role'' in bringing about the superpower treaty signed in December that bans all medium - and shorter-range nuclear missiles <PERSON> Cartledge </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as ambassador in July 1985, four months after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> became <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Cartledge </PERSON> said `` he was greatly impressed by the changes under way in Soviet society, especially debureacratization'' as a part of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform drive. `` I like your word debureaucratization, although we do n't use it,'' the 79-year-old <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> answered.

<HEAD>Sarney Warns New Constitution Could Make Brazil `Ungovernable'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said late Tuesday that approval of a proposed new constitution could make <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> `` ungovernable,'' spurring inflation and slashing economic growth. `` There is no way to estimate the economic, social and political impact of many of the articles,'' <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said in an address on national television. `` If passed as it is, the charter will cause economic and fiscal chaos and Brazilians will pay the costs.'' The broadcast was <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s last-ditch attempt to remove several proposals from the new document that will replace a 1969 constitution handed down by military generals. Legislators doubling as a consituent assembly have been working on the document for 18 months and final voting on the draft began Tuesday. The document includes proposal to limit annual interest rates to 12 percent, to give Brazilians control of all mining operations, to cut the voting age from 18 to 16, and to grant the unrestricted right to strike and a six-hour work day. All are clauses <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> would like to defeat. He estimated the government's additional costs imposed by clauses in the new document would be $ 9.5 billion. Inflation now is 23 percent monthly, the foreign debt $ 121 billion and unemployment about 25 percent. `` I am worried the constitution could turn this country ungovernable,'' <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have the funds to implement all the provisions people would be led to think were their due.'' <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> called a clause that would grant an amnesty to thousands of debtors `` clearly unjust.'' `` Many small businessmen sweated to pay their debts,'' he said. `` The constitution will signal the type of country we will become,'' <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said. `` As the constitution stands, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> ... will become a country that could have been but was n't, a country without a future.'' The second round of voting is expected to last through September. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, a 57-year-old provincial politician and poet from the poor northeastern state of <LOCATION> Maranhao </LOCATION>, came to power in March 1985 as the vice president for the popular statesman <PERSON> Tancredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Neves </PERSON>, who died before taking office. They were elected in indirect electoral college voting called by the military, which put <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> on the Neves ticket. The vote was to pave the way for civilian government after 21 years of military rule.

<TEXT>
 Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ended a pilgrimage across <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Tuesday, saying he will ask President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to grant amnesty for Irish and other illegal aliens in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said he would ask <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> next week, `` very formally and with as much conviction as I can muster,'' for an executive order granting amnesty. `` Our society and economy could absorb a lot more -LRB- immigrants -RRB- from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and many other countries,'' he said. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> archbishop's six-day pilgrimage was dedicated mainly to praying for peace and reconciliation in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. But in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> a far more pressing concern is <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> citizens living illegally in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Social service agencies estimate the number of illegal Irish at between 125,000 to 175,000, with more than two-thirds of them in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area. Preaching at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> in his last public Mass in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> lamented `` the indignity of having sons and daughters have to leave for another land because their land offers them no opportunity.'' Many Irish-Americans _ even those who, like <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, were born in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ are familiar with the hardship of immigration, and feel today that they are `` living almost as exiles,'' he said. The Roman Catholic cardinal, a former naval chaplain who has had close contact with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, told reporters after the Mass that he hoped a presidential amnesty order would cover not only undocumented immigrants from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> but `` a lot of others who were not included in that window of opportunity.'' He was referring to the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s amnesty program, under which those who had lived and worked continuously in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1982 could apply for legal residency He said illegal <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> immigrants, in particular, need an executive order because most arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after 1982 as <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s economy faltered. The pilgrimage took the cardinal, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and about 500 other people from the Shrine of <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knock </LOCATION> in the wild boglands of <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Cathedral in the urban battlefields of west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, a 613-year-old domed temple in the midst of busy <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> flew back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Tuesday.

 The spokesman for <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said the former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> leader and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, were whisked from their mansion Tuesday after security guards said that armed men cruised past the house. The Marcoses were driven to an undisclosed location, said spokesman Gemmo <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Honolulu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> dispatcher said the incident was not reported on police logs. But <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON>, another <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> aide, said the police department had been requested Tuesday to assign more frequent patrols to the area. <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said three cars drove slowly past the house at about 5:30 a.m., and around-the-clock security guards stationed at the gate of the hillside home thought they saw guns sticking out the car windows. The unarmed security guards, who were on foot, chased the cars but could not get a good description because it was still dark, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. No shots were fired and no one was injured. The Marcoses were awakened a short time later and `` went to a friend's house, I ca n't say where, but they're still on <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION> and they'll come back as soon as it's safe,'' <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON> said he expected the Marcoses to be back home Wednesday. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, have lived in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>'s swank <LOCATION> Makiki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> district since he was ousted in a popular uprising in February 1986 that swept President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> household had been warned Tuesday morning by loyalists in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> of a rumored assassination plot. `` We're going to put more teeth in the security but we do n't really want to sound the alarm too much because these threats have happened before,'' he said, adding that the Marcoses had reacted calmly to the early morning rousting `` They know it's for their safety,'' he said. In an interview with <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> DZXL </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Trinided </PERSON> was asked if he considered the alleged sighting of the men an assassination attempt. He replied: `` Yes.'' `` The security men saw that the occupants were all armed,'' he said. `` They tried to accost them but they escaped.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return from exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. In January 1987, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities barred <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife from leaving <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION> island following a coup attempt in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> by his followers. The government said the attempt, which included armed attacks on media and military facilities, was staged to pave the way for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return. Just Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had offered the Philippine government $ 5 billion to be allowed to return to his homeland. In response, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said that his representatives were negotiating with the Aquino government about a return but denied that any money was being offered.

 President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> told Cubans Tuesday to prepare for the return of thousands of their soldiers from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> if a peace agreement can be reached for that southern African country. In a three-hour speech marking the 35th anniversary of the launching of his leftist revolution, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> also defended his `` rectification'' campaign for economic reform and said Soviet-style reforms are not needed in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He called capitalist economic policies `` complete trash.'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> confirmed reports that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> recently sent reinforcements to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where it is estimated that at least 50,000 Cuban military personnel are helping the Marxist government battle rebels backed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said the reinforcements were needed to create proper conditions for a political solution in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The governments of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> reached an agreement this month for the removal of foreign troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the territory administered by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was represented at the talks. <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, lies between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said he did not want to prejudice the continuing negotiations on <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by going into detail on their status, but declared: `` We really are on the threshholds of a political solution.'' <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> granted independence to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in 1975, and Marxist forces defeated pro-Western groups in the civil war that followed. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources have said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> sent up to 15,000 more soldiers into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> since last fall to augment its presence of 40,000 military personnel. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> did not say how many reinforcements were sent, but said the deployment was needed and could not be done halfway. `` Our objective was not a military victory but a political, just solution to the conflict,'' he said. Cuban forces will remain in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> `` until the minute'' a peace agreement is signed, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> added. He said Cuban troops returning from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> once a peace pact is concluded would be welcomed back `` to the battle for the development of our country.'' He rejected suggestions from the West that socialist countries must adopt capitalist policies to move their societies forward. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> called capitalist methods `` complete trash'' and added: `` We will not weaken the role of plans or development programs.'' He said the same was true for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s one-party <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> system and no room existed for opposition groups. `` The -LRB- Communist -RRB- party is the one responsible for our country. Here there is only one party,'' he said. Referring to economic and political reforms being pursued by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other Soviet bloc countries, <PERSON> Casto </PERSON> said those who urge adoption of those programs in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> have `` an incorrect attitude, an ignorant attitude.'' `` We will never forget where we are located, and it is n't in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, but in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> he said. `` Not 90 miles from <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, but 90 miles from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.'' In the past two years, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has abandoned economic incentives aimed at boosting production and implemented a campaign of `` moral persuasion'' that emphasizes greater worker discipline. `` It would be totally incorrect for us to copy mechanically the solutions of other countries,'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said, and what may be best for the Soviet bloc may not work for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Noting that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> achieved its status as one of the world's most powerful nations economically with an average of six vacation days per worker each year, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> called on Cubans to achieve more during the working hours they have. He said he was n't suggesting taking away vacations or increasing work schedules in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Two years ago, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> declared that worker absenteeism and inefficient production threatened to make <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> a nation of freeloaders. The Cuban leader cited a lengthy list of recent industrial and public works projects in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s second-largest city with a population of 962,000. Earlier Tuesday, Cubans marked the revolution's 35th anniversary by staging a symbolic attack on a military barracks that now is an elementary school. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> attended a ceremony in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> at 5 a.m., the exact time his revolution began, and watched youth groups mount a mock assault on the <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> in this eastern Cuban city. Although the 1953 attack failed, the brutality with which it was suppressed sparked popular support for <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s fight to overthrow rightist dictator <PERSON> Fulgencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bastista </PERSON>. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> was imprisoned and later released. He fled the island, but returned with revolutionary forces aboard the yacht <ORGANIZATION> Granma </ORGANIZATION> in 1956 to start his guerrilla war in the mountains. The struggle ended in a triumphant march into <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> on Jan. 1, 1959, to begin Communist rule.

 Two Army commanders testified Tuesday that they urged a private to abstain from sexual activity after he tested positive for the AIDS virus, but they never ordered him to abstain or warned him that his sexual conduct could be a crime. The commanders testified for the prosecution at the opening of the court-martial of Pvt. <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who in March 1987 became the first member of the military to be charged with AIDS-related offenses. Others to testify included a soldier identified only as <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, and Spec. 4 <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pruitt </PERSON>, who was engaged to <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> for a time. Both women said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> told them prior to having sex that he had a rare, incurable blood disease but did not mention AIDS. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Caseyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, is accused of having threatened the health of the two women and a third male soldier by failing to use condoms during sex and by failing to warn them he had tested positive for exposure to the AIDS virus. Col. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, a physician who commanded the hospital at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION> in this southeast <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> town, said he counseled <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> in July 1986 after <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> tested positive to having antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus -LRB- HIV -RRB-, which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Presence of the antibodies indicates the person has been exposed to the virus, may develop AIDS and can spread it. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> said he advised <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> to use condoms if he had sex and to avoid high-risk partners. But he said there was no order for those testing positive to abstain from sex nor any criminal sanction for sexual activity. Capt. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulifay </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he counseled <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> `` strictly man-to-man'' on several occasions between July 1986 and March 1987 and advised him that `` he should not screw around.'' <PERSON> Kulifay </PERSON> said his soldiers, including <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, watched a film in 1986 detailing AIDS and its transmission. But under cross-examination, <PERSON> Kulifay </PERSON> acknowledged that the film did not say that soldiers who tested positive for the virus but failed to abstain from sex were committing criminal conduct. Both <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kulifay </PERSON> said they never told <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> his sexual activity might be criminal. Late in the afternoon, the soldier identified only as Ms. <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> testified that she had sex twice with <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> in August 1986, the second time the night before her husband of one month arrived in <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION>. She said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> had told her `` that he had a rare blood disease and he could die at any moment.'' She said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said the disease was fatal but did not mention HIV or AIDS. She acknowledged under cross-examination that she was testifying in exchange for immunity from charges of adultery, which is a military crime. She also said Army medical officials have told her she no longer is at risk for contracting the disease. The woman testified after the judge, Col. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, reversed himself and allowed her to testify under a pseudonym, despite defense objections. The prosecution had claimed that identifying the woman could harm her mental health. Ms. <PERSON> Pruitt </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> told her in 1986 he had `` an incurable blood disease'' but did n't say until January 1987 that it was AIDS. She said they had sex weekly from April to October 1986, with <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> using a condom about one-fourth of the time. She said they resumed relations in Jaunary 1987, even though she knew <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' test results and that AIDS is `` an incurable, contagious, fatal disease.'' She said she understood the risk. The soldier also said she and her child _ born last year and allegedly fathered by <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> _ have tested negative for HIV. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> has pleaded innocent to three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of conduct bringing discredit upon the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and one count of sodomy. He faces up to 17 years in prison, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of all pay and allowances if convicted. When he was charged, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was the first member of the military to face AIDS-related charges. Other cases have been brought since. In April, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> adopted regulations requiring commanders to warn soldiers testing positive for the AIDS virus that they face discharge or prosecution if they do n't tell sex partners about their condition or use condoms. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> have adopted similar regulations.

 Automobile innovator <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON> is seeking to evict a business associate from his northwestern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> ranch in a lawsuit that has brought bitter allegations from both sides. A jury trial in the Combined Courts of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is scheduled to begin Wednesday in the civil suit brought by <ORGANIZATION> Bricklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> against <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON>, 49, wants to remove <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>, his wife and three children from a refurbished home on a ranch <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON> owns nine miles south of here and about 225 miles west of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Earlier this year, several small businesses filed liens of more than $ 100,000 against Bricklin-owned property in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON> paid off his debts by early May, however, after he received the proceeds from the sale of his stake in <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Global was the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which introduced the cut-priced <ORGANIZATION> Yugo </ORGANIZATION> automobile to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1985. But <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON> is best known for his failed attempt in the 1970s to popularize a plastic, gull-wing sports car bearing his name. In the latest dispute, he contends that <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>, 38, is not doing the job he was hired for. The millionaire had paid Avery $ 8,000 a month to act as ranch manager and also paid him as a real estate consultant. His suit follows a lawsuit filed by <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> earlier this year in federal court. <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>'s suit contends that <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON> has not lived up to terms of a verbal agreement under which <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> was allowed to buy 500 acres of <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON>'s 8,000-acre <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION> and invest $ 40,000 in a ranch house on the property. <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON> says the agreements covered only rental of the property. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>'s lawyer, said <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON> cut off payments to his client and sought to get out of the verbal agreement in August 1987. `` When <PERSON> John </PERSON> filed a lawsuit, <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON> responded by trying to take his home away,'' he said Tuesday. In an interview in the Rocky Mountain News on Tuesday, <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON> said: `` People ca n't do the job, then they turn around and ask you for more money. It's something that would n't be happening if it was n't me, because I've got some money. And if it was n't me, it would n't be news.'' However, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said bank accounts for the initial land purchase bear both men's names, indicating a partnership existed and supporting the verbal agreement.

<HEAD>Salvage Crane Raises Vessel; Officials Find 10 More Bodies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A salvage crane working in pre-dawn darkness Wednesday raised the battered hulk of a fishing boat that sank after a collision with a Japanese submarine, and officials found the bodies of 10 more victims. That brought the confirmed death toll in Saturday's disaster to 19. Eleven people from the Fujimaru were missing and presumed dead and 18 were rescued. Coast guard ships brought families of the victims to within a few yards of where a giant crane pulled up the 154-ton charter fishing boat. The operation was broadcast live on national television. Authorities were to continue the search for bodies Wednesday. News reports meanwhile suggested the captain of the <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Self-Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> submarine Nadashio may have erred just before the collision in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The 2,200-ton submarine Nadashio collided head-on with the Fujimaru while the naval vessel crossed a busy shipping lane near the entrance of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NHK </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> and television reports quoted the ship's surviving crew as saying the Nadashio sounded its horn to warn the vessel out of its path, instead of turning to avoid a collision. The Fujimaru sank within two minutes. The submarine reported no injuries among its 75 crew. `` As captain of the ship, I did my best ... to avoid a collision,'' <PERSON> Manji </PERSON> <PERSON> Kondo </PERSON>, the 30-year-old captain of the Fujimaru, told a televised news conference Tuesday night. `` It happened too fast for us to try to rescue passengers left inside. For a captain of a ship it is the greatest blow to the heart.'' The disaster prompted speculation among <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s press that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Tsutomu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawara </PERSON> would resign to take responsibility. But at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> charged <PERSON> Kawara </PERSON> with concluding the salvage operation and accounting for all the victims. <PERSON> Kawara </PERSON> and other defense officials faced criticism from survivors, relatives of victims and news commentators about the <PERSON> Nadashio </PERSON>'s 21-minute delay in notifying the coast guard of the accident. People thrown from the ship sank out of sight as crewmen atop the submarine watched, reports said. One survivor told journalists crewmen stared back as she waved and yelled at them, `` Why wo n't you help? Of the 19 people plucked from the water, 16 were rescued by a passing yacht and a tanker and only three by the submarine. One of those rescued later died.

 At least half the thousands of operations on Americans with ruptured discs in their lower back probably were unnecessary, says a study showing 90 percent of such patients can be healed without surgery. The three-year study indicates that surgeons should change how they decide whether to operate on patients with lumbar disc problems, one of the study's authors, Dr. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Saal </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. Neurosurgeons often operate if a patient fails to improve after bed rest and suffers severe pain, leg weakness and if diagnostic exams show the disc's nucleus has broken through the disc wall and is pressing against a nerve root. <PERSON> Saal </PERSON> said none of those criteria should be used as overwhelming evidence that surgery is needed. He said the decision should be based on the patients' level of function and whether that can be improved by an aggressive rehabilitation program.

<TEXT>
 Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, goes the saying, and in the TV business, imitators are the best assurance your show is a success. `` Star Trek: The Next Generation'' has spawned another syndicated Paramount science fiction remake series for the fall, `` War of the Worlds.'' `` Friday the 13th,'' the scary syndicated series based on a long string of hit theatrical movies has prompted <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> to come up with the series `` A Nightmare on Elm Street: <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON>'s Nightmares.'' Even `` Double Dare,'' the kids' game show, has a competitor, `` Fun House,'' though its producers insist they had sold the show before <ORGANIZATION> Nickelodeon </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Double Dare'' became a success in syndication. The 5-month-old <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> strike has affected syndicated series just as much as the networks' shows. Producers of hour-long shows, like `` Star Trek,'' which is on hold until the strike ends, predicted they could n't get on the air with new episodes until October or November. `` Nightmare'' has about eight completed scripts and plans to premiere on schedule the first week of October. `` War of the Worlds'' will also premiere that week and has `` enough scripts to fulfill our obligation if the strike goes on for a long, long time,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nalevansky </PERSON>, vice president of creative affairs at <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. He said the scripts, from `` various sources,'' would not be used once the show's striking writers returned. The show is being produced in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nalevansky </PERSON> would n't say how many scripts the producers have in hand. As a tribute to the success of `` Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' which is the highest-rated weekly show in syndication, `` War of the Worlds'' has already been sold in 190 markets covering 97 percent of the country. The show premieres in the 50th anniversary year of the original <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION> `` War of the Worlds'' radio show, and the 35th anniversary year of the Oscar-winning movie of the same name. The premise is that the aliens who invaded the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in 1953 and were killed by a mysterious bacteria are reviving because of radiation in the environment. A band of scientists, aided by a soldier, struggles to alert a populace left with amnesia from their original encounter with the aliens. `` Freddy's Nightmares'' is set in a small town where the spirit of violent <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> terrorizes the townspeople who destroyed him. `` It's a show designed not to let its audience get to bed peacefully right after it's over,'' said executive producer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaye </PERSON>. He said for television, the producers would have to tone down the massive special effects of the movie version and rely more on suspense and the suggestion of violence. Also on tap for the fall in syndication is another `` reality-based'' show, `` Family Medical Center'' from <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>. The half-hour drama will, says executive producer <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, `` touch you and move you, but will also give you medical information.'' The show's medical advisor is Dr. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dishell </PERSON>, who has served as advisor to the network hospital shows `` Medical Center,'' `` M-A-S-H'' and `` Trapper <PERSON> John </PERSON>, M.D.'' <PERSON> Dishell </PERSON> said the shows would tackle such subjects as breast cancer, showing that there are optional treatments the patient can select, and the touchy subject of abortion. <PERSON> Shaye </PERSON> said the producers plan to offer both sides of controversial issues. `` Family Medical Center'' premieres Sept. 12. <PERSON> Dishell </PERSON>, incidentally, counts `` M-A-S-H'' as the best medical show ever. `` I do n't think anything will ever touch that,'' he said, though he added, `` ` St. Elsewhere' is a good show.''

The only difference, says <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kaaren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>: `` You do n't get to meet Vanna, and you do n't win cash or prizes.'' GET RID OF THE AIR FILTER, <PERSON> GEORDI </PERSON> _ <PERSON> LeVar </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, one of the stars of `` Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' says he has asked the producers to allow his blind character, <PERSON> Geordi </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Forge </PERSON>, to somehow in the future miraculously lose the odd device that he wears over his eyes to help him `` see.'' But <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, who counts his expressive eyes as one of his biggest assets as an actor, says the experience of doing without has helped him become `` a better actor.'' He told a meeting of TV critics: `` It forced me to develop other ways to express myself.'' Still, it seems, enough is enough. `` Get that air filter off of him,'' recommended co-star <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Frakes </PERSON>. `` Star Trek: The Next Generation'' is on hold until the writers' strike is over, but co-executive producer <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said they would not resort to re-shooting old scripts of the 1960s version of the show. `` To take a script that would have Mr. <PERSON> Spock </PERSON> and Capt. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> and put it in to some semblance of order that we could do would require the kind of writing we're not allowed to do -LRB- under the terms of the Writers Guild strike -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Some of your smartest, best educated friends never catch on to the rules of the game, says <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cymrot </PERSON>. `` They live in a capitalist society, but they never learn to live as capitalists.'' Instead, he states, they live under constant financial stress, forever frustrated by their inability to improve the quality of their lives. And all because they do not know the name or rules of the game. `` When you're on the football field you play football,'' says <PERSON> Cymrot </PERSON>. `` And in a capitalist society you should seek to live like a capitalist.'' In his view, you should consider yourself a business, with a balance sheet and profit-loss statement. You must understand net worth, because it is that, rather than current income, he contends, that raises the quality of life. <PERSON> Cymrot </PERSON> learned the lessons a long time ago, practiced them as an executive responsible for buying and selling more than $ 1 billion worth of property, and now, as a labor of love, wants to teach the lessons. He has written a book, `` every evening at home for a year on a yellow pad or personal computer,'' to help preach his philosophy that `` a person is as responsible for personal wealth as surely as for personal health.'' He calls it `` Street Smart Real Estate Investing,'' but it is more than that. It is a strategy for increasing net worth and the key to a high quality material life, a message that sounds simple but is forever overlooked. Because he is a real estate person, he uses real estate to illustrate his concept _ that the mass of people live lives of quiet desperation because they try to finance everything on current income rather than business investments. No matter how well educated, <PERSON> Cymrot </PERSON> laments, people make the mistake. But, he says, 99 percent of the academic curricula that tell how to make money offer nothing on what to do with it.'' And what do most people do with it? They use it, but never really invest it. `` They live like socialists in a capitalist country. They do n't know how to generate net worth, so when they run into trouble, when they seek to raise the quality of their lives, they want government to legislate wealth for them. The theme of <PERSON> Cymrot </PERSON>'s book, published by <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>, is this: You must develop a profit and loss statement. Any excess earnings from the P & amp; L statement should go into good investments. Those investments move tangible assets to your balance sheet. As these investments grow, net worth increases. When you seek to buy a home, a car, a boat or finance your child's education, the money comes from your balance sheet _ your net worth _ not from your current earnings. `` These expenditures are financed by the strength of your balance sheet. Your income may make the monthly payments, but your balance sheet provides funds for the down payment,'' he says. He stresses the idea in the book: `` Income buys daily necessities and little frills; ASSETS BUY OTHER ASSETS.'' <PERSON> Cymrot </PERSON> knows his subject, and practices it. He is chairman and director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multi-Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, and former president and director of <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McNeil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the country's largest real estate entities. Now chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Woodmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Belmont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a company that invests in properties for pension funds, he continues to build his personal net worth through outside investment activities. It is from experiences with both individual and executive investing that he draws the material for his book. But the concept does not depend on real estate, although <PERSON> Cymrot </PERSON> believes it is a superior vehicle. Any good investment will do. In his meetings with investors and students _ he lectures frequently to graduate students _ he says he has found all human beings have some aspect of success _ in business, social life or through charitable involvements. `` But the vast majority of people have n't carried that success into their investment life,'' he says in the book. `` There seems to be a bridge that is missing.'' He hopes this book can be that bridge, `` connecting those principles that reflect your success in other aspects of your life with the investment side of your life.''

<TEXT>
 Who says `` no'' now? `` No one,'' Rivers replies quietly. `` Nobody wants to rock a boat. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Saks </PERSON> was wonderful and gave me a lot of encouragement, but you're really on your own out there.'' If she faces the audience alone, some of them do n't recognize her when she first walks on stage, a slightly stooped woman wearing no makeup and a faded housedress. `` There's a lot of my mother in <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON>, in her strength,'' the Brooklyn-born <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> says. `` And my father's patients, particularly in her expressions. He was a doctor who had a large Jewish medical practice.'' Rivers began rehearsals for the show at the end of May. `` At my age, it's hard memorizing a script,'' she laughs. `` I asked everybody for advice. Somebody told me it takes <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON> a year to memorize a script. He apparently types the whole thing out. <PERSON> Roddy </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> says he records it and listens on a Walkman.'' While she was working in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> hired an unemployed actor and actress who fed her lines constantly when she was n't on stage in a club. Her 20-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, who wants to be an actress, came opening night and told her, `` Mother, I hope my opening nights are as good as yours.'' <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, now a college student, calls every night, phoning her mother in her dressing room at the Broadhurst Theater. In August, while starring in `` Broadway Bound,'' <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> will work after the show at <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s Pub, an East Side nightclub. She'll try out new material, much like she does when she's in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> at <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON>' n' Charlie's, another small nightspot. <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> has never been shy about going after a job. `` Nothing has ever fallen in my lap,'' she says. `` I've always had to go out and get it. When you're a working performer, you're a gun for hire. You do what comes along.'' To reach her mass audience, <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> still has that center square on television's `` Hollywood Squares,'' the never-ending game show she tapes when she has the time. `` I love playing the game, and I like the exposure,'' she says. `` There is no other exposure for me at the moment. I'm persona non grata at <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION> and also at <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> because <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> is a Carson production.'' She says she would go back to `` Tonight,'' where she reigned as <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s leading substitute host until becoming his rival on the Fox network. `` He does n't want any part of me,'' <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> says. `` He's angry because I dared to leave and take my own show after my contract was up. I did nothing wrong.'' Rivers is selling her home in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and is buying a smaller house there, but she's also purchased an apartment in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` When you're single, it's the only place to be,'' she says. `` In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, you sit behind a big gate and it's home entertaining. I need friends at this point in my life who say ` Let's go to the movies and get a bite afterward.''' Will she ever take the talk show road again? Rivers is not sure. `` The Fox thing was a nightmare,'' she recalls. `` The nightmare was that I was fired for bad ratings. Now when you look back, the ratings were incredible. They never got near our ratings again. The tragedy was that the show was n't given a chance. It takes a year to build an audience.'' Still, the thought of another try at a talk show persists. `` I look at people on talk shows and I think ` Oh, no. Do n't ask that question. Ask this question,''' <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> says. `` So obviously it's still very much a part of my lifestyle. But there are enough talk shows on television now. Let's all just wait, and then we'll try again.

 The dollar, reflecting its recent strength overseas, gained slightly in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today while stock prices rebounded in slow trading. The dollar opened at 132.25 yen and rose to 132.60 before edging down to close at 132.15, up 0.35 yen from Monday's close. `` Although there is no energy in the market that could keep carrying the dollar higher, the dollar seems to be receiving enough support to keep itself above the 132-yen level, at least for the time being,'' a trader at the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which shed 117 points Monday, gained 120.23 points or 0.44 percent to close at 27,303.76 in thin trading. `` It appears the market is going to hold back until the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> GNP figures,'' said one dealer.

 Stock prices rose Tuesday in thin trading as players awaited Wednesday's British trade report for June. Dealers said there was a lack of substantive news on which to trade following Monday's featureless session. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was 9.5 points, or 0.5 percent, higher at 1,848.0 at midday. Volume was an extremely light 177.5 million shares, compared with 169.1 million shares at the same time Monday. Without major corporate news to affect equities, players chose to focus their attention on Wednesday's scheduled release of British trade figures for June. Economists said they expect <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s current account deficit to have narrowed to about 800 million pounds, or $ 1.38 billion, in June from 1.2 billion pounds in May and the merchandise trade deficit to have narrowed to about 1.3 billion pounds from 1.7 billion pounds.

<HEAD>Prime Withdraws Mini-Supercomputer From Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NATICK, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is withdrawing its MXCL5 mini-supercomputer from the marketplace and taking a $ 5 million charge against its second-quarter earnings. The company also said Monday it is canceling a marketing agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Cydrome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Milpitas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which manufactured the computer. Prime attributed the withdrawal of the MXCL5 to slower growth in the mini-supercomputer field and aggressive pricing by the company's competitors. `` Because of the intensely competitive pricing environment, we determined that sales of this product would not contribute significantly to the overall profitability of Prime,'' Prime President <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> said Prime would continue to evaluate the special-purpose processor market, which Prime entered in January in an attempt to compete with field leaders <ORGANIZATION> Alliant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Acton </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Convex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Richardson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Company officials said the second-quarter earnings reduction would amount to about 10 cents a share. Analysts had forecast earnings of about 23 cents to 27 cents a share. Prime is to announce quarterly earnings Thursday. The base price for the standard MXCL5 system was $ 579,000, while a more fully configured model was price at $ 774,000. The Unix-based system was designed for sophisticated engineering and scientific number-crunching. Prime announced in May it was laying off about 700 employees because of job redundancies and attrition after a February merger with <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The merger moved Prime to second in the computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing market behind <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The company reported first quarter net income of $ 14.5 million of revenues of $ 363.7 million, including <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION> operations.

<HEAD>Report Says Feds Probing Drexel-Boesky Tax Connection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has uncovered evidence that shows <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> may have aided former stock speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> in an alleged scheme to violate tax laws, a report published Tuesday said. The Wall Street Journal, quoting unnamed sources familiar with the investigation, said the government is focusing on a series of tax-motivated stock trades three years ago between the investment banking firm and <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Seemala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper said investigators are examining evidence suggesting <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> was permitted to buy and sell stock with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to claim immediate trading losses for Seemala for tax purposes, and that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> later reimbursed the company for the losses. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said Tuesday the company would not `` respond to stories based on rumor or leaks. We know of no wrongdoing by our firm or any of our people. That remains our position.'' Since <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> was charged in the nation's largest insider-trading case two years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, along with its junk bond operations, has emerged as the largest target of an ongoing federal securities-fraud investigation. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has yet to be formally charged, but it has been the subject of numerous press reports. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has recommended civil charges of securities-law violations against the firm and some key employees. The Journal article, however, suggests the case against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> may be expanding to include questions of possible tax-law violations. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, along with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, which reportedly are conducting a criminal investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, are probing the alleged tax scheme, according to the newspaper. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> agreed in November 1986 to pay a record $ 100 million to settle insider-trading charges and was sentenced last December to three years imprisonment on a single felony count of conspiring to lie to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge today confirmed <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s Chapter 11 reorganization plan, including $ 2.475 billion to compensate women injured by the Dalkon Shield birth control device. The order entered by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> will become final if no appeals are filed by Aug. 25. However, <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> and attorneys in the case have said previously such appeals were likely. The reorganization of <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>, a Richmond-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, includes the company's merger with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 700 million exchange of stock. At a hearing last week, attorneys for <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> said more than 94 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> claimants who cast ballots on the reorganization plan voted for acceptance. Almost 72 percent of the 195,000 claimants returned ballots. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> stockholders approved the reorganization plan by more than a 99 percent vote. If any appeals are filed, payment of larger claims for Dalkon Shield injuries would be delayed. However, the company will place $ 100 million in the Dalkon Shield trust fund to pay smaller claims pending resolution of appeals. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in August 1985 as lawsuits mounted against the birth control device, which the company marketed in the early 1970s.

 Stock prices hovered in a narrow range today, continuing Monday's mixed pattern. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.45 to 2,076.28 in the first half hour of trading. Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 399 up, 430 down and 506 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 18.40 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Analysts said many investors were avoiding making big commitments in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report due out Wednesday on the gross national product for the second quarter of the year. Private estimates generally call for inflation-adjusted GNP growth to come in at about the same 3.6 percent annual rate reported for the first quarter. Anything much higher than that might intensify worries about inflation and higher interest rates, brokers said. Today the government said new factory orders for durable goods jumped 8.8 percent in June. However, brokers said the figure was n't regarded as conclusive, because most of the increase came in military goods, a category that is often subject to wide month-by-month fluctuations <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> fell 3 to 57 -LCB- in over-the-counter trading.

<HEAD>Western European Car Industry Is Booming, Alas</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Western European car industry, the world's largest, is enjoying record sales as consumers from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> flock to showrooms eager to buy `` new wheels. While this is undoubtedly good news, some industry people, believe it or not, find it distinctly worrying. The reason is that the boom has attracted more competitors in what already is a fiercely competitive market. That has heightened fears that the field will become overcrowded, leaving the car makers vulnerable in a downturn, which could come as soon as next year. `` The market is booming,'' said <PERSON> Sanjay </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabysing </PERSON>, head of the automotive group at <ORGANIZATION> DRI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a private economic forecasting firm in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Sales, which have been buoyant in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> since the mid-1980s, are expected to grow to a record 12.5 million cars this year from 12.4 million in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> DRI </ORGANIZATION> said. In comparison, 11.3 million cars were sold in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and 3.3 million in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the most recent year. `` It's a representation of the reasonably good economic growth in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in recent years,'' said <PERSON> Garel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhys </PERSON>, an automotive economist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardiff </ORGANIZATION>. The sales growth stems from strong consumer spending created by income growth, tax cuts and an increasing willingness among Europeans to take on debt, the experts said. In addition, more businesses are using company cars, they said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> have been experiencing particularly strong demand, while sales have been slowed somewhat in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by a sluggish economy. Import restraints and the overall buoyancy of the market have encouraged Japanese manufacturers to build more plants in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The market also has attracted other Asian and Eastern European competitors, like the makers of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s inexpensive <LOCATION> Yugo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers have stepped up their activity by buying up European luxury car makers. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has bought <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has bought <ORGANIZATION> Automobili </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lamborghini </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which already owns <ORGANIZATION> Aston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lagonda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, is rumored to be interested in <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. `` The market has become more competitive,'' <PERSON> Dabysing </PERSON> said. Most of the competition still comes from other Europeans. Unlike the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where the Big Three automakers control the market, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has a large number of domestically based manufacturers. The top six auto makers and their market shares in 1987, according to <ORGANIZATION> DRI </ORGANIZATION>, were: <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, 14.9 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, 14.2 percent; the combination of <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Automobiles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citroen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, 12.2 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, 12 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, 10.6 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, 10.6 percent. The biggest rivalry among the Europeans is between <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>, both of which are trying to expand their markets across the continent in anticipation of the Common Market's elimination of most trade barriers in 1992. <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>, for instance, makes 60 percent of its sales in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, but expects to face new threats at home once trade restrictions on imports are lifted across the European Economic Community. The Japanese, meanwhile, have already captured 11.4 percent of the European market, mostly through imports, <ORGANIZATION> DRI </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The Japanese are now moving on to the next stage as they have in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, trying to diffuse the controversy that their sales have created in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rhys </PERSON> said. The pioneer, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, operates a plant in <LOCATION> Sunderland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and has already doubled its planned 1992 capacity to 200,000 cars. `` There is no doubt that manufacturers like <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- will follow this route. Where and when is difficult to answer, but they will be coming,'' <PERSON> Dabysing </PERSON> said, adding that the Japanese might also bring over cars it makes in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Indeed, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, vice president for business strategy for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brentwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, said that's `` the biggest worry we have.'' The Japanese companies, already the most productive car makers, will be able to cut costs further when they set up more operations in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which will save them considerable transportation costs. `` We will get an excess capacity situation again, which will increase the cost pressures on everybody and will increase the competitive pressures,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. The market could develop an excess capacity of 1 million cars, he estimated. The 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has yet to decide whether it will restrict Japanese imports after 1992, when it becomes a barrier-free marketplace. The experts are expecting the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> to choose a voluntary quota on Japanese car sales, perhaps limiting them to 10 percent of the market. `` Some people argue that there are too many independent manufacturers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rhys </PERSON> said. `` If the market turned off considerably in the future, the firms would find it difficult to make profits and the question would be, how do the firms survive? The companies have toughened up by striving to become more productive and to produce higher quality cars, in an effort to close those gaps with the Japanese leaders. Western European makers have also joined forces, either through mergers or through joint ventures to produce various components, and in one case, an entire car. <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Volksagen </PERSON> are working together on an automatic gear box; <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> A.B. and <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> are working on an engine; <ORGANIZATION> Rover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> developed a car together, the Rover 800 also called the <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> Legend. This has helped the Western European makers _ which do not enjoy the economies of scale the Americans have _ to become more profitable. Although the drop in the dollar has hurt luxury car makers who export to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dabysing </PERSON> said that in 1987, `` they -LRB- the major European car makers -RRB- made money on the operations level for the first time in a long, long time and 1988 is proving to be a good year, too.'' The cloud on the horizon is the setback the industry is expecting in 1989. The experts are forcasting sales of 11.5 million cars to 11.75 million cars, a decline of as much as 8 percent. But the competitors wo n't be put off, the experts said. `` It's entrepreneurship. Hope springs eternal in the human breast,'' <PERSON> Rhys </PERSON> said. `` Everybody feels they can make a lot of money. It's a very big market and they want to be in it and they want to be in it in a bigger way in the future.''

<HEAD>German Automakers Try Incentives To Lure U.S. Buyers</HEAD>

 Buffeted by a cheaper dollar and Japanese competition, European carmakers are hoping to hold on to their lucrative slice of the American market. Two of them are trying new incentives to keep Americans buying. At present, the Europeans have a 5.1 percent share of the American mmarket, compared to 18.6 percent for the Japanese. `` Fly to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>,'' says a newspaper advertisement of the West German automaker. The company offers a single business-class seat or two coach-class seats to anybody who orders a Mercedes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It is the first time <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> buyers have been offered a free trip to pick up the prestige autos at the factory in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>. `` We offer them a luncheon and, if they want, a factory tour,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, spokesman of <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. Since the beginning of the advertising campaign earlier this year, about 700 Americans have accepted the offer, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. With factory deliveries, buyers save $ 3,500 for the lower-priced Mercedes to almost $ 10,000 for the luxury model, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> added. After the buyer completes his European vacation, the company arranges to ship the car without charge to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealer who handles customs arrangements and other paperwork. For <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> cars delivered new in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, prices range from $ 29,190 for the 190E model with manual transmission to $ 77,065 for the 560 <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. Last year, 89,000 Mercedes were sold on the American market. In the first six months of 1988, sales were steady at 44,066. Porsche, the West German builder of sports cars, lost some business this year mostly because of the weak dollar. `` That made our cars more expensive and less affordable,'' said <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Mckinley </PERSON> from the company's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> headquarters in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. Porsche sold 12,824 cars in the first six months of 1987, but sales declined to 8,807 in the same period of this year. The company is now trying to recapture some ground with an incentive program. The company's Trust-Tourist Delivery program offers discounts between 7 and 10 percent, depending on the model, for all models ordered in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and picked up in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Prices range from $ 26,560 for the Porsche 924 to $ 69,380 for the Porsche 928. The company sees its main competition from Japanese cars and from its German rival. `` In the lower-priced cars it's the Japanese product. When it comes to the expensive models, we have to fight Mercedes,'' she said. The Italian auto giant <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>, which sells <ORGANIZATION> Alfa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romeos </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lancia </ORGANIZATION> cars on the American market, has similar fears. The company took its own <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> models off the market because of the Japanese competition in the small-car area. <PERSON> Gualberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramieri </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, expects that the new <ORGANIZATION> Alfa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romeo </ORGANIZATION> 164 will capture some lost ground in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The price for the car on the American market has not been fixed yet, he added. In the first six months of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> sold 2,708 <ORGANIZATION> Alfa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romeos </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, down from 3,422 in the same period last year. For the whole 1988, <PERSON> Ramieri </PERSON> expects the sale of about 6,000 cars through the company's 150 dealers across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> also lost some ground in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It sold 9,320 cars last year but only 3,454 cars in the first half of 1988. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Derderian </PERSON> said the company hopes a new model, the Peugeot 405, will recapture some buyers. The British luxury car maker <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> does n't fear sales losses. The car with a basic price of $ 45,000 finds most of its admirers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the bigger cities, according to company spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>. Last year the company sold 10,028 of its cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> expects no major changes for this year. BMW, another German luxury carmaker, has no plans to offer special incentives to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> buyers. `` We know about the free trips Mercedes offers but we have no similar program,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> from BMW <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. His company sold 87,839 cars last year on the American market. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> expects the same result for this year.

 At age 65, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s calling came long before his landslide victory in the non-binding <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential race in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s earliest-in-the-nation primary. He is a publisher, not a politician, and while his brief campaign gave him a chance to speak out on everything from education to electronics, he wo n't be at the side of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this fall. It's questionable whether he could carry his own towns of <LOCATION> Peterborough </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>. Though he made <LOCATION> Peterborough </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION> _ population 4,876 _ a major publishing center by pioneering such successful magazines as Digital Audio and Byte, residents like to say he also has fired half the town. A few years ago, a <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> ex-employees association sprang up, and about 50 people showed up for a dinner to swap anecdotes. Even <PERSON> Green </PERSON> attended. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> has had his problems elsewhere, too. He's been sued by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, the telephone company and his former wife. At 65, he seems to make a lasting impression _ positive or negative _ on almost everyone he meets. His message, ballyhooed on the editorial pages of his publications, is simple: `` I get great satisfaction out of encouraging people to make money, to be successful,'' he said. And he is generally respected, even among those he has rankled, as a man of considerable vision in the computer field. `` He foresaw the future of computers in the early 1970s and ran articles on the application of computers,'' said one former <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> executive, who asked that his name not be used. `` In the early 1980s, he started a magazine on compact disks. He was two years ahead of the others.'' He played a role in the growth of fledgling industries such as microcomputers, compact disks and the repeater relay business for ham operators by giving manufacturers a place to advertise and hungry consumers a place to learn about the new products. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said he has started 25 magazines, many of them still being published. After selling out to <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, one of the largest computer magazine publishers in the world, for a reported $ 16 million several years ago, he started another publishing house, <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, which he claims is worth $ 20 million. He writes industry newsletters, biannually publishes a yearbook on compact disks, puts together foreign travel tours for ham operators, has written a $ 100 video for businesses to teach proper public relations and is thinking about producing classical music tapes. His second wife, <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON>, meanwhile, has produced 22 dance videos that are `` selling like crazy,'' he said. He has mingled with King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, fellow ham radio operators, and said he has convinced <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> to introduce ham radio in schools to get youngsters interested in electronics. Another goal is to sell electronics magazines to students in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Oddly, widely connected,'' the anonymous executive called him. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> is a founding member of Mensa, an organization of people who score in the top 2 percent of intelligent tests _ a man of a thousand ideas and a solution to every problem. His vice presidential campaign gave him a chance to air his thoughts on how to improve the quality of education, increase the number of electronic experts in the country, solve the drug abuse problem and get people off welfare. Strangely, many of these opinions have found ample display on the pages of his technology publications, which he churns out from an 18-room farmhouse. `` As long as I can remember, he was always pushing, pushing people to get out and be creative and to use their talents to get ahead in the world,'' said another former employee, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> DeTray </PERSON> of Troy, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION> `` He's happiest when new things are starting up and growth is taking place,'' <PERSON> DeTray </PERSON> said. `` He seemed less happy when new projects become routine.'' Life has been far from routine for Green since he left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> 27 years ago. Two years earlier, he had been fired as an editor of a ham radio magazine, so he started his own, called 73. `` I sold everything I had, my 22-foot Chris-Craft for $ 1,500, my plane for $ 2,000 and my <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3,500, enough money to print my first issue,'' he said. He moved to <LOCATION> Peterborough </LOCATION> in his native <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> _ he was born in <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION> _ because of the town's proximity to the 2,280-foot Pack Monadnock Mountain, a ham radio center. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> provided jobs, paid taxes on a multimillion-dollar business and put the town on the map with `` a good grade of magazines,'' Selectman <PERSON> Merton </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> said. He was elected president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and, by his own account, raised attendance from eight to 100 within two months by presenting, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said, more interesting speakers. But, as <PERSON> DeTray </PERSON> put it, `` He's not your average taciturn New Englander. He probably grated on a lot of townspeople.'' `` He has bright ideas, but no depth to them,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Westheimer </PERSON>, another former employee. `` He hires people to implement them, and when it does n't work, he fires them.'' He also has had personal problems. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> claims he was convicted of tax evasion in the early 1970s because he wrote editorials critical of the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Then <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> sued after he published a circuit number _ he claims he was only repeating something that had been published elsewhere _ that enabled readers to make toll-free calls. The case ended when he agreed not to publish any more information on various telephone company devices. In the early 1980s, he said he was sued by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which claimed the use of the name <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audio </ORGANIZATION> for one of his magazines was too close to one of their trademarks. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> later dropped the suit. And there was the disagreement with his first wife, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, over who created Byte, considered the oldest and most successful computer magazine. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said the magazine, begun in the mid-1970s, was in her name because of his tax situation. A lawsuit and countersuit ensued, and <PERSON> Green </PERSON> wrote about the dispute for years in editorials. He even put up a billboard in front of his office that read, `` Merry Christmas To All But One.'' It is symptomatic of his special brand of success _ and perhaps his biggest regret _ that <PERSON> Green </PERSON> has achieved more notoriety than acclaim. `` I've accomplished a lot of things, and not many people know about it,'' he said. `` That bothers me.''

 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest banks, said Tuesday its half-year earnings nearly tripled from a year earlier, when its results were hurt by major additions to provisions for loans to developing countries The bank said earnings for the six months ended June 30 increased to 446 million pounds, the equivalent of $ 767 million, or 59 pence a share, from 150 million pounds, or 20 pence a share, a year ago. National Westminster added 6 million pounds to its provisions for developing country loans in the first half of 1988, compared with 496 million pounds in the same period last year. Total income, which includes interest, commission, investment and foreign exchange trading income, grew 15 percent to 2.34 billion pounds from 2.04 billion pounds. Investment banking continued to be a troublesome area for National Westminster, in part because of the depressed securities markets. Investment banking operations had a pre-tax loss of 10 million pounds, compared with a 2 million-pound pre-tax profit a year ago. National Westminster's total assets rose 19 percent to 102.5 billion pounds from 86.3 billion pounds.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amfac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it has agreed to a $ 49 per share all-cash merger with <ORGANIZATION> JMB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a deal valued at $ 920 million. The board of directors of Amfac approved the proposal unanimously, according to a company statement. A newly organized affiliate of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> JMB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> would merge into <LOCATION> Amfac </LOCATION>, the surviving entity, and `` each outstanding Amfac share will be converted into $ 49 in cash,'' the statement said. <ORGANIZATION> Amfac </ORGANIZATION> stock was down 87 -LCB- cents a share to $ 46.87 -LCB- at midday Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> JMB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> is a privately-held real estate investment, development and management firm.

 Crop futures prices opened sharply lower again today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> but analysts said the markets may be nearing the bottom of a week-long slide prompted by recent rains in the drought-stricken Farm Belt. `` I think the market's gone too far down,'' said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, assistant vice president in charge of grain futures trading for <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think the market's overdone the rains we've gotten and it's still ignoring the fact that we have a phenomenal amount of -LRB- crop -RRB- damage,'' she said Scattered showers in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> during the past week improved the condition of corn and soybean crops in most major growing states, according to agricultural experts. And the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s latest 6-to-10-day outlook predicts normal precipitation in the region early next week. But Ms. <PERSON> Leow </PERSON> said losses totaling more than $ 2 a bushel in the soybean pit in the past seven sessions do not reflect the irreparable damage already done to the crop. In early trading, wheat was 4 cents to 6 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.65 a bushel; corn was 11 -LCB- cents to 13 -LCB- cents lower with September at $ 2.91 a bushel; oats were 4 -LCB- cents to 6 -LCB- cents lower with September at $ 2.47 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 24 cents to 30 cents lower with August at $ 7.74 a bushel.

<HEAD>Government Lifts Import Ban On Beef</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> announced Tuesday it was lifting a three-year-old ban on imports of foreign beef, but said it would maintain an import quota system that has been opposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kun-hwan </PERSON> said imports for 1988 would be limited to 14,500 tons. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> did not say how much beef would be imported after this year, but indicated imports would be limited in order to protect the local beef industry. The end to the import ban was designed to avoid trade friction with foreign countries while at the same time alleviating domestic beef shortages, <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been pressing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to drop the ban on beef imports to help correct <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s $ 10 billion trade imbalance with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is also pressing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to drop restrictions or bans on many other imports and opposes the beef quota system. There was no immediate reaction from local farmers who have strongly opposed imports of beef unless the government guaranteed a definite price support system before lifting the import ban. Many Korean farmers went bankrupt due to an excessive import of foreign beef cattle before the last ban was imposed in 1985. Farmers have staged demonstrations to demand retention of the import ban. As reported previously, <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> said the proposed tonnage would include 3,000 tons of high quality beef for use at tourist hotels to be imported from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Officials said high quality beef could start arriving next month. The remaining 11,500 tons of both high quality and ordinary quality beef would be for general public consumption with sales open to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and other bidders. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> said imported beef will be stockpiled for sales in case domestic sales prices exceed designated levels to seek price stabilization.

 Republican congressional leaders told President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today to use his `` best instincts'' in considering whether to veto the plant - closing bill One key <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senator predicted the legislation will become law no matter what the president does. House Republican leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> told reporters that `` arguments were made on both sides of the issue'' in a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders with the president at the White House. `` Some of us in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> made the point that we were within the range of being able to sustain the president's veto if there were some work done and there was n't a diminution of votes on the Democratic side,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said `` There were arguments made on the other side too that frankly it was probably impossible to sustain in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and that maybe the president would want to give consideration to simply letting it become law,'' he said. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said the president `` did not give an expression one way or another at all'' as to his intentions. The president told reporters at the opening of the meeting that he never decides about a bill until it reaches his desk. When asked what he believed the president would do, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said, `` He's a very pragmatic individual and has been over eight years of time. I think the last word that was said was, ` Mr. President, just use your best instincts.'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said that `` arguments were made with respect to how it may or may not affect the campaign,'' but Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., said, `` I do n't think it will make much difference. `` My guess is plant closing will become law but the parts about layoffs will be very controversial and will lead to some litigation later on,'' he said. `` I think probably the vote is there in both houses to override. <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said the Republicans in the meeting `` were expressing pretty good vote counts but saying the president ought to do his thing.'' The bill requires companies to give workers 60 days' notice of plant closings and layoffs. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is likely to go ahead and veto the bill. But the spokesman also said no final decision had been made. `` It's always open until it's done,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters after the arrived at the White House for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s signature. The legislation passed both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by veto-proof margins, and some Republicans have said they're reluctant to vote against it because of polls showing broad public support for the proposal. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> disputed assertions that Republicans may be preparing to deliver that sort of message to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, saying, `` I would say there are number of them who will recommend a veto.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has until Aug. 3 to make a decision. He could veto the bill, sign it, or let it pass automatically into law without his signature. The administration's stand on the issue has been repeatedly assailed by Democrats, who say common decency requires that workers be told when they are about to lose their jobs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says business should have the `` flexibility'' to close plants and lay off workers without the 60 days' notice.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plowed forward today with efforts to fashion a drought-relief package following a warning from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> not to `` bust the budget'' with aid to desperate farmers. `` It ai n't over'til it's over, and it's never over in this committee,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, declared as the lawmakers scrambled to meet a self-imposed deadline of writing a bill and putting it on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> this week. A mound of amendments still faced the committee, which had announced prior to the congressional break for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> that it had finished with all but the formalities. But de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> was still shooting for a quick wrapup followed by floor action this week and a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee next week. As the lawmakers went back into session, Deputy Secretary of Agriculture <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> told them that the administration's specific objections boiled down to two features now in the legislation One would streamline and expand the system under which the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> provides feed aid to livestock producers. The other would require farmers to buy federal crop insurance in the future as a condition of getting relief. `` We do n't think that makes much sense,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. Major grower groups wrote to lawmakers on Monday to urge an end to the crop-insurance provision. In his letter Monday to the lawmakers, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> warned against `` creating windfalls for some'' as part of the bill because it would `` mean less for the truly deserving.'' He said farmers who bought crop insurance `` should not be penalized relative to farmers who did not act with such prudence.'' The measure should not `` include any incentive for a farmer to plow under his crops,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He also said it was necessary to keep a rein on spending. `` To put it very simply, we must not bust the budget,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He reiterated that lawmakers should not start rewriting the 1985 farm act. Earlier, the chairman of a key <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel said he hoped to speed congressional approval of the drought relief package, which could come to $ 6 billion or more, much of it taken from $ 7.5 billion in government savings arising from the drought. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said getting money to family farmers quickly was a top concern as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> began debate today on drought relief with an eye toward floor action Thursday. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and administration officials have raised concerns that the plan may go too far in helping large farm businesses and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said he wants a trim and tightly targeted relief bill. `` There are a number of things we would like to see not added on to these bills,'' Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said today on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' program. `` The president does not want this bill to be a Christmas Tree -LRB- with -RRB- ornaments hung all over it.'' The aid money would come from an estimated $ 9 billion in government savings in federal subsidies this year for some farmers who are benefiting from higher agriculture prices. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called for slower deliberation to ensure the destination of aid money is controlled. `` We're spending money not just on the family farmer, but to help agribusiness,'' said <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>. `` I would say we can do a lot better job of honing where the money will go. Instead of doing it this Thursday, let's do it next Thursday if we have to.'' The drought relief bill has pitted some farm groups against each other, with dairy producers squared off against beef producers and some consumer groups. Dairy producers want <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to increase milk price supports to counter the rising cost of feed for their herds and a decrease in production due to the drought and heat. They argue that shoppers will pay higher food bills if the relief is n't granted. The drought-hurt dairy farmers deserve some federal aid, such as feed assistance, but `` legislating a higher dairy support price is not justifiable,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, a national consumer group. `` Once again, the dairy producers are going whole hog for a special deal that would cost Americans more as taxpayers and as consumers,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> executive director <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>. `` And higher food prices impact hardest on those least able to pay. Mandating higher support prices for milk after feed costs slacken would once again encourage overproduction and government costs.''

 Stock prices declined slightly in quiet trading today, continuing Monday's mixed pattern. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.42 to 2,070.41 by noontime on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 543 up, 657 down and 543 unchanged. Analysts said many investors were avoiding making big commitments in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report due out Wednesday on the gross national product for the second quarter of the year. Private estimates generally call for inflation-adjusted GNP growth to come in at about the same 3.6 percent annual rate reported for the first quarter. Anything much higher than that might intensify worries about inflation and higher interest rates, brokers said. Today the government said new factory orders for durable goods jumped 8.8 percent in June. However, brokers said the figure was n't regarded as conclusive, because most of the increase came in military goods, a category that is often subject to wide month-by-month fluctuations <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> rose -LCB- to 17 in active trading.

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest retailer and a financial services conglomerate, on Tuesday reported a 5.4 percent drop in its second-quarter earnings despite higher revenue for the period. Sales at <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> stores advanced 7 percent over a year ago, compared with revenue gains of more than 10 percent in each of the company's three other major operating units, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 369.4 million, or 98 cents per share, for the three months ended June 30, compared with $ 390.4 million, or $ 1.03 per share, for the same period a year ago. Revenue rose 10.8 percent to $ 12.98 billion from $ 11.72 billion a year earlier. The <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which includes the more than 800 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> department stores, had second-quarter revenue of $ 7.2 billion, compared with $ 6.7 billion a year ago. Income from the stores group rose 10.5 percent to $ 188.8 million but the results included a gain of $ 31 million from an accounting change. Excluding that gain, income from the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> fell $ 13 million from the $ 170.8 million reported for the second quarter of 1987. `` The merchandise group continues to perform quite badly,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Weller </PERSON>, a retail industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> said the merchandise division performed sluggishly despite `` adjustments and realignments,'' including moves into specialty retailing via <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' recent purchases of the Pinstripe Petites and Western Auto chains. In March, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> announced it was restructuring the management of its merchandising sector to make the unit more profitable and more responsive to changing consumer tastes. Second-quarter revenue from the <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> rose 17.5 percent to $ 4.5 billion while income from the unit fell 17.5 percent to $ 206.6 million. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> blamed the income decline on an accounting change and an increase in claims. The <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which includes the Discover card, had quarterly revenue of $ 1.05 billion, up 11.2 percent from 1987. Income from the unit fell 51 percent to $ 15.1 million. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said the year-ago income figure of $ 31 million included a $ 58 million gain from the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> branch offices. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> reported a $ 100,000 profit for the Discover credit card operation, marking the second consecutive profitable quarter for the card after two years of losses. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> has said it expects the card to break even this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Coldwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> had quarterly revenue of $ 371.5 million, a 10.2 percent increase. Income from the unit advanced nearly 19 percent to $ 15.2 million. For the first six months of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> had net income of $ 548.9 million, or $ 1.45 per share, down 20 percent from $ 678.3 million, or $ 1.78 per share, for the first half of 1987. First-half revenue totaled $ 25.14 billion, up 13.3 percent from $ 22.20 billion for the first six months of 1987.

 <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, two major computer products companies, on Tuesday reported gains in quarterly net income. <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, said its net income for the second quarter totaled $ 9.2 million, or 22 cents a share, compared with a loss of $ 5.5 million in the year-ago period. Revenue for the quarter ended June 30 totaled $ 951.7 million, up 21 percent from $ 785.9 million in 1987. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said attributed the growth to revenue increases in the company's business services and data storage products businesses Revenue growth in the business services unit reflects the acquisition of the SAMI-Burke marketing information business in late 1987. Control Data provides computer products and services for scientific, engineering and business applications worldwide. For the first six months of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 16.9 million, or 40 cents a share, on revenues of $ 1.85 billion, compared with net earnings of $ 1.7 million, or 3 cents a share, on revenues of $ 1.61 billion in 1987. In <LOCATION> Redmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> reported a 74 percent jump in fourth quarter net income. Profits for the quarter ended June 30 totaled $ 30.01 million, or 54 cents a share, up from $ 17.26 million, or 31 cents a share for the same period in 1987. The personal computer software manufacturer said its fourth-quarter revenue totaled $ 170.47 million, up 71 percent from $ 99.76 million a year ago. `` These results represent strength across all channels of distribution and in all product groups,'' said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> president and chief operating officer. `` Our international operations were particularly strong, generating 47.8 percent of revenues for the year.'' For the fiscal year, net income totaled $ 123.91 million, or $ 2.22 a share, on revenues of $ 590.83 million, up from profits of $ 71.88 million, or $ 1.30 a share, on revenues of $ 345.89 million for fiscal 1987.

 <ORGANIZATION> Transamerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday reported earnings from continuing operations rose 7 percent in the second quarter, partly boosted by the acquisition of a commercial lending operation. Profits from continuing operations totaled $ 87.6 million, or $ 1.12 per share, up from $ 82.1 million, or $ 1.05 per share, in the second quarter of 1987. Consolidated net income, however, fell to $ 89.45 million from $ 105.96 million in the year-ago quarter. The financial services concern posted a $ 1.87 million after-tax gain from investment transactions in the second quarter. That's down from a similar gain of $ 8.26 million and $ 15.6 million in gains from discontinued operations posted in 1987. Revenue for the quarter totaled $ 1.996 billion, up from $ 1.977 billion for the same period in 1987. The insurance and financial services giant said expansion of its commercial lending and leasing operations contributed to the quarter and six-month earnings gains. `` Our insurance and finance operations both achieved outstanding results, reflecting the fundamental strength and earning power of our businesses,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. Profits from continuing operations during the first half of 1988 were $ 163.1 million, or $ 2.08 per share, up 9 percent from 1987's $ 149.9 million, or $ 1.91 per share First half consolidated net income for 1988 totaled $ 166 million, including $ 3 million in other gains, while first-half 1987 consolidated net income of $ 217 million included $ 33 million of other gains and $ 34 million in income from discontinued oprations, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, vice president of corporate relations. Total revenues for the first six months of 1988 were $ 3.975 billion, up from $ 3.810 billion for the same period last year, the company said. The company expanded its commercial lending operation with the acquisition in October 1987 of the <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acceptance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, now called <ORGANIZATION> Transamerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In its life insurance operation, profits were increased by reducing expenses and higher yields on invested assets, the company said. Property and casualty insurance increases were attributed to expansions in workers' compensation and re-insurance production.

 <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its second-quarter profits rose 29 percent as its steel division outperformed the energy operations that had carried the company for most of the decade. `` It's back to being a steel company again'' in terms of generating profits, said steel industry analyst <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> reported it earned $ 213 million, or 74 cents per share, up from $ 165 million, or 56 cents per share, in the second quarter of 1987 Sales for the quarter rose 7.5 percent to $ 4.3 billion from $ 4 billion. The company's USS division, the nation's largest steelmaker, turned in operating profits of $ 223 million on sales of $ 1.6 billion, or nearly $ 70 per ton of steel shipped. The <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> energy segment, comprising <ORGANIZATION> Marathon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, operated at a profit of $ 104 million on sales of $ 2.4 billion. Marathon's operating profit was $ 120 million on sales of $ 2.2 billion, while <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gas lost $ 16 million on sales of $ 201 million. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said lower crude oil prices and higher exploration costs dampened Marathon's performance. But, said analyst <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazier </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prescott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Turben </PERSON>, `` The energy division is still profitable despite $ 15 -LRB- a barrel -RRB- oil.'' `` It's not a drag'' on earnings, he said. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>'s diversified businesses showed profits of $ 69 million on sales of $ 389 million, up from $ 5 million on sales of $ 235 million in the year-ago period. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> acquired Marathon in 1982 and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gas four years later. `` During the period when steel was still down, the cash flow from these operations helped support the whole debt structure,'' <PERSON> Lazier </PERSON> said. Now steel is coming on strong and energy is languishing. `` <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON>'s strategy looks increasingly good,'' <PERSON> Lazier </PERSON> said. First half profits totaled $ 370 million, or $ 1.26 per share, compared to $ 93 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier.

A <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined comment Tuesday. The affected products include sheet steel used in automobiles, appliances, office furniture and a variety of other consumer goods.

 Stock prices eked out a small gain Tuesday in the slowest trading in more than five weeks, as Wall Street awaited the latest reading on the pace of the economy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 2.14 to 2,073.97. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 8 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 764 up, 676 down and 513 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 121.96 million shares, down from 215.14 million in the previous session and the smallest total since a 116.75 million-share day on June 20. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 142.60 million shares. Analysts said many investors were avoiding making big commitments in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report due out Wednesday on the gross national product for the second quarter of the year. Private estimates generally call for inflation-adjusted GNP growth to come in at about the same 3.6 percent annual rate reported for the first quarter. Anything much higher than that might intensify worries about inflation and higher interest rates, brokers said. On Tuesday the government said new factory orders for durable goods jumped 8.8 percent in June. However, brokers said the figure was n't regarded as conclusive, because most of the increase came in military goods, a category that is often subject to wide month-by-month fluctuations. While the overall market made little progress, many individual issues went their own separate ways responding to corporate earnings reports. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>, for example, fell 1 to 30 -LRB- amid some evident disappointment over the size of its second-quarter earnings gain. Per-share profits increased to 74 cents from 56 cents in the like period a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> rose -LCB- to 17 in active trading. The company reported sharply higher earnings for the second quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION>, on the other hand, dropped \ to 35 | as the company posted slightly lower quarterly profits <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> fell 2 -LCB- to 58 in over-the-counter trading. The company reported higher quarterly profits, but the results evidently fell short of many investors' expectations. <ORGANIZATION> Cadnetix </ORGANIZATION>, another OTC issue, tumbled 1 | to 5 The company, which produces specialized computer work stations, said its fiscal quarter ended June 30 came in at about the break-even level. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 3.03 billion, or 0.11 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained .29 to 150.03. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose .51 to 306.45, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up .51 at 265.19 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell 1.33 to 385.79. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index closed at 304.64, down .04.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its will give `` due consideration'' to a buyout offer from <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> despite its ambiguity. The Polaroid board, in a regularly scheduled meeting, said it has retained <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to study <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s proposal to acquire the company for $ 40 a share But <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> reiterated that it believes its strategic plan is sound. The instant-film company said <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s interest may be contingent on the absence of an employee stock ownership plan and on access to funds in the Polaroid pension plan. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s offer values <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> at about $ 2.88 billion based on 71.9 million shares outstanding. But <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> has indicated it might not proceed unless it manages to get the recent issue of 10 million shares rescinded. That would lower the value of the bid to $ 2.48 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> said the recently established employee stock plan has purchased about 9.7 million shares of common stock from the company. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> said that purchase, as well as the dedication of pension funds to benefit employees and retirees, can not be reversed. Shamrock is a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investment firm controlled by <ORGANIZATION> Roy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, nephew of the late <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>, and his family. After <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> unveiled his proposal, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> management issued a statement reiterating its support for a restructuring plan announced earlier this month that inclues layoffs and cost-cutting. `` We firmly believe that this is, without doubt, the right course for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> and for all of its shareholders, employees, customers and communities,'' it said.

The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filed a civil complaint in federal district court in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> against <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>, a British citizen living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON>, a British citizen living in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> is a former managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LTD </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> securities firm, and <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON> is a former director of <ORGANIZATION> Vickers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> da </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Costa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> brokerage firm. In its complaint, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> alleged that <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>, through his employment at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION>, learned that two British companies, <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury-Schweppes </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION>, were likely targets of takeover attempts, efforts that normally push a company's stock up in value. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> alleged that <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> purchased securities on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stock exchange through accounts managed by <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> brokerage firm. The complaint said that <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON> to buy options to purchase <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury-Schweppes </ORGANIZATION> stock after <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> learned through his job that a bid for the company was being discussed in mid-October 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> also charged that <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON> placed orders in early November 1986 to buy stock in Associated Engineering after <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> learned that a client at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> was planning to make a bid for the company. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON> placed orders for <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> and himself for 60,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> stock. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said that neither <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON> profited from the trades. Under a proposed settlement, the two men consented to the entry of injunctions barring them from any future securities law violations. <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> admitted to the allegations of the complaint, but <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON> neither admitted nor denied the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s allegations.

<HEAD>Plunging Crop Futures Spark Broad Decline in Other Commodities</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices plunged for the seventh straight day Tuesday, triggering massive selloffs and huge price declines in several other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodity markets as speculators took profits. `` Today the commodities had their Black Tuesday,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, vice president in charge of coffee futures at <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Everybody was getting out of commodities.'' Grain futures plunged along with soybeans on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> while prices for coffee, sugar, livestock and silver futures plummeted on other exchanges. Energy futures declined moderately while stock-index futures advanced. The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s index of 21 commodities skidded 8.11 points to 245.52, the steepest one-day drop for the closely watched inflation barometer since its record 9.7-point fall on Dec. 11, 1980. Most <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> crop futures fell their permitted daily limits on better rain prospects in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and reports that recent showers had helped the crops. `` It's a real panic right now,'' said <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, grains analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` You've got people just saying, ` Let me out. They're scrambling.'' The contract for August delivery of soybeans settled at $ 7.55 -LCB- a bushel, the lowest soybean futures price since May 26, when the July contract settled at $ 7.54. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s latest 6-to-10-day outlook, issued late Monday, predicted normal precipitation in most of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> during the first five days of next week. And the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday that scattered showers in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> during the past week had relieved drought stress in parts of the Corn Belt. State agriculture officials generally reported improved corn and soybean conditions. <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, assistant vice president of grain futures trading for <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the soybean market was probably nearing a bottom after losing nearly $ 2.40 a bushel in the past seven sessions. `` I think the market has overdone the rains we've gotten and it's still ignoring the fact that we have a phenomenal amount of -LRB- crop -RRB- damage,'' she said. The next official estimate of the drought damage will be the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s next crop report on Aug. 11. Wheat settled 19 cents to the limit 20 cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.51 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 9 \ cents to the limit 15 cents lower with September at $ 2.87 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 9 cents to the limit 10 cents lower with September at $ 2.44 a bushel; soybeans were 18 -LCB- cents to the limit 45 cents lower with August at $ 7.55 -LCB- a bushel Sugar and coffee futures tumbled on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in massive sell-offs. Analysts linked the selling to disappointment over the markets' inability to break free of the bearish influence of the soybean market, even when positive news surfaced The sugar market, for example, ignored bullish news that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had bought 250,000 tons of sugar, said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She described the sugar sell-off as `` massive, massive liquidation and profit-taking.'' Coffee analyst <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> said heavy news coverage of the Midwestern drought had persuaded many small investors to gamble on rising commodity prices `` and today was the bloodbath.'' Coffee for September delivery settled 4.84 cents lower at $ 1.3295 a pound; October sugar was 2.41 cents lower at 12.06 cents a pound. Most most livestock and meat futures prices fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle settled .48 cent to 1.15 cents lower with August at 65.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent lower to .10 cent higher with August at 77.57 cents a pound; hogs were .22 cent to the limit 1.50 cents lower with August at 45.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.15 cents to the limit 2 cents lower with August at 34.80 cents a pound. Gold futures advanced but silver fell steeply in mostly technical trading on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said. Gold settled $ 5.10 to $ 5.60 higher with August at $ 431.70 a troy ounce; silver was 15.6 cents to 17.7 cents lower with July at $ 6.88 a troy ounce. Most oil futures prices headed lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in quiet, directionless trading highlighted mainly by technical factors. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled unchanged to 9 cents lower with September at $ 15.96 a barrel; heating oil was .39 cent lower to .20 cent higher with August at 43.81 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .30 cent to 1.06 cents lower with August at 50.16 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.30 points higher at 266.15

 Three of the nation's major oil companies, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, on Tuesday said their profit for the second quarter was boosted by strength in refining, marketing and chemicals operations. <ORGANIZATION> Amerada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the 15th largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil company, reported a net loss of $ 23.5 million, compared with a year-earlier profit of $ 89.4 million, or $ 1.06 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third biggest oil company, said its second-quarter net income quadrupled, lifted by refining, marketing and chemicals as well as the sale of its West German subsidiary. The oil giant earned $ 527 million, or $ 2.17 a share, up from $ 129 million, or 53 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1987. Second-quarter revenue rose 10.6 percent, to $ 9.4 billion from $ 8.5 billion a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, emerged on April 7 from bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the federal code. The company paid $ 3 billion to settle litigation with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and initiated another $ 2.6 billion in payments to its other creditors. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings for the latest quarter include an after-tax gain of $ 301 million, or $ 1.24 a share, from the sale of its West German subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A.G </ORGANIZATION>. The sale was part of the company's restructuring program under the Chapter 11 proceedings. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> also signed a letter of intent in June to form a joint venture with Saudi investors to refine and market oil products in parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In the first half of the year, net income tripled to $ 769 million, or $ 3.17 a share, from $ 247 million, or $ 1.02 a share, in the same period in 1987. First-half revenue was up 6.5 percent, to $ 18.1 billion from $ 17.0 billion. Fourth-ranked <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said its second-quarter profit jumped 45 percent _ to $ 520 million, or $ 1.52 a share, from $ 358 million, or $ 1.04 a share, a year earlier. Second-quarter revenue was unchanged from a year earlier, at $ 7.3 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said the company's profit margins from sales of oil products were the highest in two years, while chemical operations continued to benefit from strong demand in the industrial market. Earnings in the first six months increased 63 percent _ to $ 1.2 billion, or $ 3.43 a share, from $ 719 million, or $ 2.10 a share. Revenue for the period edged up 5 percent, to $ 14.8 billion from $ 14.1 billion. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, the nation's eighth biggest oil company, saw its earnings in the quarter soar to $ 170 million, or 72 cents a share, from $ 3 million a year earlier. The <LOCATION> Bartlesville </LOCATION>, Okla.-based company said that although its gains were broad-based, refining and marketing were especially strong. First-half profit was $ 300 million, or $ 1.27 a share, compared with a loss of $ 29 million in January-June 1987. Revenue for the six months rose to $ 5.78 billion from $ 5.18 billion. New York-based <PERSON> Amerada </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said its second-quarter net loss of $ 23.5 million included a loss from refining and marketing operations of $ 6.5 million, compared with profit of $ 55.7 million a year earlier. Second-quarter revenue fell to $ 882.8 million from $ 1.1 billion a year earlier. In the first half, <PERSON> Amerada </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> earned $ 42.2 million, or 51 cents a share, down from $ 270.8 million, or $ 3.21 a share.

Negotiations in the presence of federal mediators adjourned for the day without an accord, but a government official said he would not characterize the talks as unproductive. `` They're still talking,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` All I can really say is that mediation is in progress and, as far as we're concerned, it's going to go right down to the deadline ... We'll be available as long as we can help.'' While the two sides met behind closed doors at the board's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> offices, an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> congressman introduced legislation to push them closer to an agreement and block a threatened Aug. 4 strike C & amp; NW provides the principal daily rail service for about 40,000 commuters in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area. `` Although I dislike intervention by the federal government, we can not stand idly by,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>. `` Congress may act if they fail to do so. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s bill would require the company and union to accept as binding the recommendations of a presidential emergency board appointed to examine the dispute if the two sides fail to reach agreement on their own by the strike deadline. At issue is a plan by <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to cut costs by eliminating the jobs of 1,156 of its 2,600 union brakemen. Company spokeswoman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> said the nation's eighth-largest rail carrier could save $ 51 million a year and become more competitive if it reduced the size of its train crews from an engineer, conductor and two brakemen to only an engineer and conductor in most cases The company contends that improved technology has made the jobs obsolete. The union insists safety would be compromised without the brakemen and said the cuts would violate its contract. The outcome of the dispute could set a precedent for crew sizes throughout the rail industry, which is entering national bargaining with its unions this year. A threatened <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> strike was averted in April when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, acting under provisions of the Railway Labor Act, appointed an emergency board to investigate the dispute. As part of his order, the union was prohibited from striking before 12:01 a.m. on Aug. 4. In a 29-page report to the president on July 1, the emergency board proposed doing away with 689 brakemen's jobs, cutting one brakeman per train in most cases and both brakemen when approved by an arbitrator on a train-by-train basis. `` Without such relief, -LRB- C & amp; NW -RRB- will be forced to take more drastic economic action which could jeopardize the livelihood of all its employees,'' the board said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said the report was not acceptable.

 The dollar rose against most major currencies Tuesday, encouraged by a government report that durable goods orders reached a 30-month high in June. Gold prices also rose. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 431.90 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from a five-month low of $ 427.25 reached Monday. Analysts said many dollar traders were on the sidelines, reluctant to make large commitments in advance of Wednesday's scheduled release of the government's gross national product figures for the second quarter The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s durable goods report provided one of the few sparks in Tuesday's trading. Analysts said a plunge in commodity prices and weakness in the bond market had little impact on the dollar. `` The market was looking for something to hold onto and durable goods was the primary impetus that took the dollar up,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sapiro </PERSON>, vice president for foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said durable goods orders rose 8.8 percent in June, their biggest increase since an 8.9 percent jump in December 1985. In overseas trading, dealers said the dollar was helped by suspicions that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might be forced to tighten credit after the GNP report. Dealers predicted the GNP figures would indicate continued strong economic growth as well as inflationary pressures. The British pound was quoted at $ 1.7135 late in the day in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's $ 1.7265. In later <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, the pound slipped to $ 1.7075 from $ 1.7210 late Monday.

 Troubled <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it lost $ 135.3 million in its second quarter, due mainly to reserves set aside to cover potentially bad loans. The loss, which the company said might substantially diminish or possibly eliminate stockholders' equity, compared with a loss of $ 6.5 million for the second quarter in 1987 and a loss of $ 17.8 million for the first quarter of 1988. `` The decline in second-quarter earnings is attributed to a high provision for loan losses, as the reserve for loan losses was substantially enhanced during the quarter, and to an increased negative impact form a higher level of non-performing assets,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> American. Officials said the company had $ 598 million in non-performing assets after the second quarter, an increase of $ 62 million from the first quarter.

 <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it had agreed to a senior management group's sweetened leveraged buyout offer valued at nearly $ 306 million. Company officials also said they had reached a tentative settlement of a class action lawsuit filed last week by shareholders challenging the fairness of the management group's initial $ 47 per share offer, valued at about $ 282 million Under the new plan, the group offered to pay $ 50 cash per share for up to 85 percent of the company's 6.01 million shares of common stock, or 5.1 million shares. for $ 50 a share. Unpurchased shares would be converted into a new series of preferred stock with a $ 53.33 per share liquidation preference. A tender offer is to begin Thursday, and expires Aug. 24. The buyout was conditioned on necessary financing being obtained and a majority of shares being tendered. <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> dipped 25 cents to $ 47.50 a share Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` The transaction represents a fair deal for shareholders,'' said <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordell </PERSON>, chairman of the special committee of the company's board of directors that recommended acceptance of the new offer. `` We are confident that the employees and customers of <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> will be well served by the continued, and now increased, commitment of senior management.''

The management group has arranged $ 278 million in short-term bank financing to complete the buyout, and permanent financing through $ 245 million in bank credit and the planned sale of about $ 110 million in senior subordinated debentures. `` This transaction will best serve the interests of <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>'s valued employees, suppliers and customers, and the communities in which we operate, while enabling <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> management to control the destiny of the company,'' said <PERSON> Flom </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> employs 2,400 people at five mini-mills and 16 reinforcing steel fabricating plants in nine Southern states.

<HEAD>Imports Of Advanced Technology Up Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s imports of advanced technology for machinery and other projects rose 49 percent in the first half of this year from the same period last year, government officials said Wednesday. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> attributed the sharp increase to changing corporate strategies to cope with the appreciation of the Korean won and increasing labor unrest. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was the largest technology supplier with 181 contributions, followed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with 90 and European nations with 46, the officials said. Machinery and electronics accounted for nearly 60 percent of the technology introduced during the period. The total also included chemical and textile technology. The figures indicate South Korean corporations largely rely on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for machinery-related technology, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for electronic and electric technology and European nations for chemical technology, the officials said. Imports included 36 technological imports for factory automation, almost three times the figure for the first half of 1987. Officials said the increase reflected corporate efforts to cut or freeze employment to reduce risks of labor protests. Labor unrest is a growing problem for South Korean companies. Officials have reported more than 1,000 labor strikes so far this year. Most were settled through negotiation, but some were violent and resulted in the closings of plants, in some cases for months. The Korean won has appreciated by about 18 percent against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar in the past year, making <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products relatively less expensive.

 <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which last month said it intends to merge with an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> utility, has received a rival $ 2 billion merger offer from the parent of giant <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, officials said Tuesday. The friendly stock-swap offer from <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION> values <ORGANIZATION> SDG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E at about $ 2 billion based on Tuesday's closing stock price. SDG & amp; E said in a news release it was studying the offer but refused further comment. <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION>, recently formed as a holding company for <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION>, said it would pursue the merger _ which it conditioned on <ORGANIZATION> SDG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E dropping its proposed merger with <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ only if it were accepted by SDG & amp; E management. Analysts and <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION> termed the potential deal a boon to both consumers and SDG & amp; E stockholders. They predicted <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> consumers, whose electricity bills are among the nation's highest, would get a piece of <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>'s large generating capacity The 4.8 million customers of a combined company, they said, would benefit because the enhanced purchasing power of a huge, merged utility would win better prices for power bought from utility companies elsewhere in the West. `` It makes total sense,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Tirello </PERSON>, a securities analyst who follows both companies for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> He said <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement said a goal of the merged companies would be to reduce <ORGANIZATION> SDG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E's rates, which presently are 25 percent higher than <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>'s. The proposal, made privately on Monday and announced by both companies Tuesday, calls for <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION> to exchange 1.15 shares of its common stock for each of the approximately 55.8 million <ORGANIZATION> SDG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E shares outstanding. Preferred and other classes of stock would be swapped at comparable rates. Management ranks would be thinned through attrition and voluntary retirement, <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION> said. Any merger would require the approval of the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, federal regulators and the stockholders of both companies. <ORGANIZATION> PUC </ORGANIZATION> deliberations would likely take a year. <ORGANIZATION> SDG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E's stock price rose $ 1.25 a share Tuesday to close at $ 34.12 -LCB- in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price was unchanged at $ 31.37 -LCB- On June 13, <ORGANIZATION> SDG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E announced a proposed merger with the <ORGANIZATION> Tucson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> that the companies valued at $ 5.7 billion. That merger would allow <ORGANIZATION> SDG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E, primarily a buyer of power rather than a producer, to take advantage of <ORGANIZATION> Tucson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>'s excess generating capacity and give <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> a ready market for its power. <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION> said a merger with <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> would be more logical than <ORGANIZATION> SDG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E's prposed merger with <ORGANIZATION> Tucson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> because the companies' coverage areas border on each other and their lines are interconnected <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> has ample power, both self-generated and purchased from other utilities in the West, to provide for <ORGANIZATION> SDG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E, said spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> company's rates have been pushed up by rising power prices and by the need to build high-cost transmission systems to serve booming developments in the county. <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> serves 3.8 million customers across most of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. SDG & amp; E, with 1 million customers, provides electricity and natural gas in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and electricity in a slice of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer, stressed in a letter proposing the merger that it was a friendly proposal. `` We have no intention of attempting to acquire your company other than in a transaction approved by your board of directors,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> SDG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E released by <ORGANIZATION> SCEcorp </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tirello </PERSON>, author of a book predicting that such mergers will form huge regional power companies, said a combination would save the companies more than $ 200 million a year. `` The ratepayer does real well in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> simply because <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> has said, ` We want to bring you down to our level as quick as we can,''' <PERSON> Tirello </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> ratepayer gets the advantage of increased buying power.''

On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, contracts for September delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude, the nation's benchmark grade, settled Monday at $ 16.05 per barrel, off 33 cents from Friday's close. The near-term crude contract gained $ 1.41 per barrel last week. Refined products also lost ground. The near-term contract for wholesale gasoline fell .85 cent per gallon to settle at 51.22 cents, and heating oil dropped .78 cent per gallon to finish at 44.17 cents. Traders said activity was light as market attitudes turned bearish about the cartel's chances for limiting overproduction and firming prices. The market's strong move last week stemmed from bullish interpretations of a proposed cease-fire between <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> combatants <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and reports that members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> would meet soon to discuss prices. Both were interpreted as signs that fractious elements in the gulf would be able to overcome their differences and prop up the sagging oil market. The respected <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s pricing committee would meet Aug. 3 in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, but the news failed to inspire traders to follow through on the market's previous gains Instead, traders said, the market appeared to recoil with its characteristic doubts about whether <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ever could get together on the price issue. `` After a runup based on speculation, there's a natural amount of profit taking,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Redoglio </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Rates Mixed in Latest Treasury Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities were mixed in the government's latest auction. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 6.6 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.88 percent on Monday, up from 6.76 percent last week. Another $ 6.6 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.09 percent, the same as last week. The three-month rate was the highest since Oct. 13 when the bills sold for 6.96 percent. The rate on six-month bills was last higher on Oct. 19, when they averaged 7.21 percent. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors _ 7.10 percent for three-month bills with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $ 9,826.10 and 7.45 percent for a six-month bill selling for $ 9,641.60. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that the average yield for one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages was 7.79 percent last week, the same as the previous week.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s new top executive has been criticized as lacking vital restaurant experience to turn around the company's flagging Burger King chain, but <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> says he's just waiting to test his management ability. The troubled food giant on Monday plucked <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> from rival <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, where he served as chairman. The 54-year-old <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> also served as vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which acquired <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 He begins his new job Aug. 1. Unlike General Foods, which has rested on the success of its Oscar Mayer meats and Jell-O gelatin, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> has few high-growth products, analysts said. `` <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has been a big cheese in a company with a lot of easy brands,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON>, a managing director at <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Hopwood </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. But at <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> `` will have to get down to trench warfare, and he was never in that mode before,'' <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> said. Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's fourth-largest food conglomerate, produces <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> vegetables, Haagen-Dazs premium ice creams and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>'s frozen fish. Of greater concern to some is <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s lack of experience in the restaurant business. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s restaurant unit, which also includes Steak & amp; Ale and <PERSON> Bennigan </PERSON>'s, accounts for nearly half of the company's total revenue. In the fiscal year ended May 31, restaurant sales slipped 5 percent as <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> continued losing market share to rival <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> despite a $ 200 million advertising campaign. `` <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s weakness has been more related to restaurants, and if they got a guru in restaurants, they may have been better off,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Froelich </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Echoing those concerns, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> stock fell $ 1.75 a share to $ 35.12 -LCB- Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is confident he can transfer his management skills to a new industry. In a telephone interview, he said: `` I feel I have a very good understanding of the operating fundamentals in the restaurant business. I'm going to have an opportunity first hand to test whether my judgments about what's important are right or not.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> follows in the footsteps of the hard-charging <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spoor </PERSON>, who returned from retirement to run <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> on an acting basis nearly five months ago when former chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> resigned under pressure. Analysts have criticized <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, saying it lacked clear and vital leadership in recent years. Its after-tax profit plummeted 62 percent in fiscal 1988 to $ 69.3 million on sales of $ 6.2 billion, largely because of a restructuring charge associated with the sale of its Godfather's Pizza chain and a number of other restaurant operations and consolidations General Foods' performance under <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is not immune to criticism, either, some analysts say. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a 22-year veteran of General Foods, counters that between 1984 and 1987, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>' growth rate went from `` relatively flat to the point where we're growing better than 3 percent a year.'' As for management style, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he typically tries to `` determine what the basic direction is we should be going and then in a very aggressive and determined kind of way provide clear direction to the organization and insist on commitment and dedication.'' Despite speculation on Wall Street, analysts are divided as to how attractive a takeover candidate <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> may be. <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON>, for instance, said <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> had `` too many wrecks in the ditch right now.'' Some experts have estimated the Burger King chain could fetch as much as $ 1.5 billion if it were spun off as a separate company, but <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> said the chain would bring only about $ 900 million because it was at least two years away from a turnaround. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he would be surprised if selling Burger King `` made any sense.'' `` It has been very successful in the past, and I have to believe there is room for a strong No. 2'' in the fast-food hamburger business, he said. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> stated that <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s position would not be filled. The heads of the subisidary's domestic foods, coffee and <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> units would report directly to <PERSON> Hamish </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> chairman.

<HEAD>Domestic Car And Truck Sales Rise 5 Percent In Mid-July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Auto sales probably will continue at mid-July's uneventful rate or slower through August and until the end of the car model year, according to one industry analyst Combined <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of domestically built cars and light trucks rose 5 percent on a daily basis July 11-20 from the comparable period of 1987, to 349,263 from 295,755, automakers reported Monday. There were nine selling days in this year's period and eight last year. Sales moved at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.8 million, trailing rates that frequently topped 8 million in the first half of the year, but closer to the 7.7 million rate of mid-July 1987. Last August, dealers used buyer incentives to clear excess cars from their crowded lots. After a hot-selling first half of 1988, auto inventories are low, analyst <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON> said Monday. `` This year they wo n't need the fire sale approach,'' said <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON>, of J.D. <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Agoura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported increases in daily car sales from July 11-20, offsetting a slight decline in <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> car sales <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> sold 106,791 cars in the nine-day period, up from 96,746 in eight days of the comparable period last year. Daily sales were down 1.9 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sold 69,039 cars, up from 55,686 a year earlier, a 10.2 percent increase in daily sales. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> sold 29,956 cars, up from 24,037, a 10.8 percent daily increase. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> sold 53,434 light trucks, up 7.7 percent on a daily sales basis, and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> sold 29,172, up 9.8 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sold 45,426 light trucks, with the daily sales rate down 0.8 percent. `` It is an indication that finally sales are beginning to slow down to more of a normal pace. It's a slight slowdown in the marketplace, but still a pretty healthy rate,'' <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON> said. Erratic sales last year exaggerate fluctuations among manufacturers from 10-day period to period, he said. `` It all depends who had incentive programs going last year and who has them this year.'' Overall, he said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, with 49 percent of the market in domestically made cars, has halted an erosion in its market share. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, with 31.7 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, with 13.7 percent, have shown slight gains, partly at the expense of imports facing price disadvantages because of changing exchange rates, <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON> said. Sales of imported cars and trucks are reported at the end of each month. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> sold 6,344 of its U.S.-made cars in the mid-July period, up from 5,469, a 3.1 percent daily sales gain. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> had a 0.6 percent gain, selling 3,376 U.S.-made cars, up from 2,984 a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> sold 1,745 domestically produced autos, up from 874 in a period when its plant was n't fully operational a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> sold 690 U.S.-made cars. It did not begin domestic manufacturing until September 1987.
