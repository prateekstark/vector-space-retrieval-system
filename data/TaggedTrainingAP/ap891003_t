<HEAD>Brom Convicted of First-Degree Murder for Family Ax Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A teen-ager accused of killing his parents and younger brother and sister with an ax was found guilty on Tuesday, his 18th birthday, of four counts of first-degree murder. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON>, tried as an adult, had pleaded innocent by reason of mental illness. The Olmsted County District Court jury deliberated about four hours and 45 minutes before returning the guilty verdicts. Brom showed no emotion as the verdict was read shortly after 9 p.m. He was charged with four counts each of first - and second-degree murder in the February 1988 slayings The first-degree murder convictions mean that jurors believe the slayings were premeditated. The trial will move to a second phase Thursday to determine whether <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> was mentally ill at the time and therefore not responsible for his actions. `` Obviously, coming in we knew that phase one was not the strong part of the case for us,'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> had agreed that <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> committed the murders but argued that they were not premeditated, said the defense would show that Brom `` is and was mentally ill.'' If Brom is found to have been sane when the murders occurred, he faces a life imprisonment sentence with no chance of parole for 17 -LCB- years on each of the four counts <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON>, 41, suffered 22 ax wounds in the slayings at the <PERSON> Broms </PERSON>' rural <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> home; <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON>, 41, suffered 18 wounds; 13-year-old <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> had eight wounds and 11-year-old <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> had nine, Dr. <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> testified Tuesday. Olmsted County Attorney <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON> in his closing argument said the number of times each victim was struck by the ax could in itself be enough to prove premeditation. The prosecutor also reminded jurors that <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> had many conversations with friends in the months before the murders in which he discussed killing his family. Brom did not testify. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Brom </PERSON>'s discussions with friends were fantasy. `` The ` plan' consisted of a series of disjointed, illogical, fantasy-like thoughts, flitting in and out of the mind of <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> intermixed with thoughts of suicide,'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said.

 A Democratic state senator and a Republican political aide forced each other into a congressional runoff Tuesday, capturing the top two spots in a special election to fill the seat of the late Rep. <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Democrat <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> easily took the top two spots in the three-way race, leaving a stunned state Attorney General <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> trailing by more than 15,000 votes. The special election was scheduled after <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> died in a plane crash Aug. 13. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> will face each other in an Oct. 17 runoff. Democrats have been hoping to strip the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> of a seat it has held for more than 16 years. Unofficials returns showed <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> with 51,383 votes, or 42 percent, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> with 45,623, or 37 percent, and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> with 24,497, or 21 percent. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 36, who ran unsuccessfully for the same seat in 1988, surprised the better-known <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who finished third in the home county where he was district attorney for 12 years. `` We felt all along that we charted a course down the middle that if there was a runoff we would be favored by each side,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` There were a lot more people who voted Democratic than Republican.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 37, who was criticized for wanting to leave the attorney general's office after only 21 months in office, said he would support <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> in the runoff. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 45, a longtime aide to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, said his campaign had `` come from nowhere to be here tonight.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared Tuesday that the attempted coup against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was not `` some American operation,'' and he wants `` to see democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> succeed.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman said the government would continue seeking <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster. `` Nothing's changed. Everything remains the same. We'll continue to press for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal'' and his arrest to stand trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug charges, said spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. Late Tuesday, after a day of sorting out conflicting reports on the coup attempt, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had determined it had failed. Soon after, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s officials claimed victory in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Though the overthrow attempt, by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, failed after a morning gun battle at the forces' headquarters, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the attempt `` shows the opposition to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> within <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> It shows there is a strong faction at least within the PDF -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- that felt he should be removed.'' `` We did not take any action that would have constituted direct involvement,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` We had helicopters that were in the air observing and we had some troops around one of the causeways there to protect access and rights and so forth.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself told reporters emphatically, `` There were rumors around that this was some American operation and I can tell you that is not true.'' Greeting Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> for a State dinner at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if he were disappointed that the coup failed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stated emphatically, `` I want to see democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> succeed.'' Tuesday night, Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, introduced legislation authorizing the president to use the armed forces to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power and bring him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The president, meanwhile, refused to speculate on whether he should have used the military to intervene. `` I know the facts and some of the critics do n't,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in response to questions at the White House dinner. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for not making it a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operation _ for not sending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to help the insurgents. `` Here you have brave people in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> ... trying to rid themselves of a drug dealer and a thug who's taken over their country,'' said the chairman, Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., after an hour-long classified briefing from <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officials `` And for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with all of our strength and force and all of our belief in democracy, to stand by _ two miles away as the crow flies _ and do nothing, and allow these people to fail, personally I think is wrong.'' But according to an article in Wednesday editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, it was opposition from <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> a year ago that defeated a plan approved by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to finance, train and supported disaffected Panamanian officers in an attempt to overthrow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> objected that the effort was too close to the election, might amount to authorizing assassination and might result in the deaths of many Americans, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>'s account quoting unidentified `` well-placed'' sources. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, informed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after the president met with the visiting Soviet defense minister that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s forces appeared to be prevailing. `` He just said ` OK,' and went into another meeting,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The spokesman said visiting <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. in a meeting earlier Tuesday with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` emphasized the integrity of the various countries in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and we have respected that integrity and have not intervened.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, like the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration before it, has called repeatedly for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking to reporters before the outcome in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was clear, appeared intent on influencing the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in favor of the insurrectionists. Asserting that he hoped his words would be `` conveyed instantly'' to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We have no argument with the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. We've had good relations with the Panamanian Defense Forces. `` Our argument has been, as have many other countries, with Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> who aborted the democratic will of the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. And that's where our argument was and that's where our argument is.'' Last May, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had told reporters, `` I would love to see them get him out.'' Asked then if he were calling for the Panamanian Defense Forces to overthrow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` We'd like to see him out of there, not just the PDF, the will of the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. ... I would add no words of caution. The will of the people should be implemented.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> acknowledged that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had some advance word that a coup attempt might be afoot but said he was unaware of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s fate or even his whereabouts. `` We had some indications this sort of thing was in the works, but until it happens, you never know,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He characterized the prior information as `` rumblings.'' Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would move quickly toward normalizing relations with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is deposed but added that any such step would be impossible so long as <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remains in power. After <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted by two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand juries on drug smuggling charges in February 1988, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration imposed a series of economic sanctions in a bid to oust the general, who is commander of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military forces. Among other actions, the administration froze all Panamanian assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. For the past 19 months, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not recognized the Noriega-led government as the legal authority in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was first alerted about the gunfire by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION> shortly before the president met with Mexican President <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>. Then, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> gave a briefing to both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> jointly, although details in late morning remained sketchy, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. About 50,000 Americans live in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, including more than 12,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel attached to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Southern Command. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens living in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were being asked to stay at home. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> put its troops and civilians on the isthmus on <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alert </ORGANIZATION>, its highest level of readiness. American troops in combat gear took up positions 600 yards from the barracks in downtown <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were not involved in any way in the disturbance. He added, `` Our facilities down there are locked up; they are secure.'' The American military personnel in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have been ordered to stay put and not to travel on roads outside the U.S.-owned facilities, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> command is about one-half mile from the scene of the shooting and mortar fire, officials said.

 Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> conferred with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday on the prospects for reducing nuclear and conventional arms and assured the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people they need not fear the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Soviet defense minister was kept waiting a half hour as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got a briefing from national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> on the attempted coup in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The president was informed after the Oval Office session with <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> that the attempt to oust Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> apparently had failed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> broke his usual practice of refusing to answer questions during photo opportunities by telling reporters the fighting in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was not `` some American operation.'' The president asked <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> to `` pay my respects to President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' and said the recent talks with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> were `` very fruitful.'' `` We are satisfied. We've got some problems still,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, but `` things are moving in the direction we wanted.'' <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, emerging 30 minutes later, offered his own rosy assessment of the outlook for arms control. The burly, beribboned general told reporters: `` The main point of my discussions with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president was the question of arms control, the question of reducing conventional armed forces and weapons and the question of promoting a relationship between our two militaries and our two nations.'' Speaking in Russian, <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> said: `` The Soviet people are cherishing the best sentiments and feeling towards the Americans. We were comrades at arms during the Second World War and we succeeded in winning a great victory. And now we have no grounds, no reason whatsoever, to go into confrontation -LRB- against -RRB- each other.'' Asked if this meeting had furthered the prospects for an arms pact, <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> smiled and said, `` Well, I do n't think I could really assure success at the negotiations within half an hour.'' But he added, `` Our negotiating teams are working in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. I think we are moving forward step by step to the ultimate conclusion of agreements on the questions. Anyhow, we are counting on progress.'' White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said afterward <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` reiterated his support for perestroika,'' the Soviet process of reorganization into a more open society, and `` expressed his desire to conclude agreements on conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and on chemical weapons as soon as possible and his hopes for progress in START,'' the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks. If <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> was perturbed at being kept waiting and having events in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> intrude on the Oval Office meeting, he did not show it. Asked if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> favored the removal of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power, <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> said, `` I am not prepared to talk on the issue because I am not aware of what happened in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. ... We have not talked about it at all. I ca n't tell you anything more.'' <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> were hoping to reach agreements on several steps to improve the rapidly warming relations between the leadership of the Soviet and American armed forces. `` We are thinking of expanding our exchanges in the military field next year and we are going to draft a whole program which will be designed to promote better understanding between our two militaries and between our peoples,'' he said. Earlier, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> took <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, about 62 miles north of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to see the battlefield where Union troops repulsed Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s Confederate soldiers in a bloody three-day battle in July 1863 that marked one of the turning points in the American Civil War. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> is a Civil War buff. After a two-hour tour of the battlefield and viewing its famous landmarks like Devil's Den and the Wheat Field, <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> said, `` I wish we would not have any battlefields like this one in the future,'' The <ORGANIZATION> Gettysburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>'s busy schedule called for speeches Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myer </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, near the Pentagon and before the Council on Foreign Relations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a private group. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, a Marine training base in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, on Wednesday, and <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> on Thursday. On Friday he will tour <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, then return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a news conference with <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>.

 Violinist <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> said he hopes to rebuild his life and career now that he's been placed on probation for pleading guilty to a drug-related break-in. `` I regard this event as a major turning point in my life,'' <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> said Monday after a <LOCATION> Dukes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> court hearing. `` Of course I'm relieved that this ordeal is over,'' he said. `` The experience has been a frightening and profound one. What I want to do now is get back to my music and my life.'' <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty to breaking into a <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard motel room, where he was found July 27. A search of the room found a bottle containing more than 20 grams of cocaine, a hypodermic needle with a small amount of heroin and a dagger, authorities said. A county grand jury met Monday morning and returned indictments of breaking and entering, possession of heroin and cocaine and possession of drug paraphernalia. After lawyers on both sides conferred, <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> pleaded guilty to the break-in charge, which carried a maximum penalty of six months in jail. Judge <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, however, placed <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> on three years' probation, in which he must continue a drug treatment program and will be subject to random testing <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> pleaded innocent to the other charges, and they were placed on file, pending completion of probation. `` This should n't have been treated as a serious criminal matter and it was n't,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> has been to a treatment center and has turned his life around.'' Born in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> began playing violin at age 8. He has performed at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where in 1974 he became the first American medalist at the Tchaikovsky Violin Competition. After <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON>'s arrest, family members and colleagues said his drug use had begun recently, and followed the trouble he had building on his early celebrity. `` This was a very important experience actually in his life,'' <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> said. `` He was feeling down in the dumps and he turned toward drugs.'' <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> has undergone seven weeks of treatment, and couselors say his progress has been good and they are confident he can remain drug free.

Shuttle managers were assessing the readiness of the orbiter, the payload, the worldwide tracking network and other elements during a two-day meeting that began Monday. No difficulties surfaced during the first day, officials reported. Oct. 12 is the opening day of a launch opportunity when <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and Jupiter are aligned properly for sending the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft to that distant planet. The launch opportunity closes Nov. 21. Atlantis' crew of five astronauts is to dispatch <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> on a six-year journey to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. When the spacecraft reaches there in 1995, it will fire a scientific probe into the Jovian atmosphere and then orbit the planet for two years of scrutiny. Because <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> will be powered by two generators fueled by plutonium-238, three citizens' groups last week sued in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to prevent the launch. The groups contend that a launch accident could spread poisonous plutonium over a heavily-populated area of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has said the `` highest probability of launch area release of plutonium due to a shuttle accident is less than 1 in 2,500 and such a release would have no appreciable adverse health effects on the population.'' The agency notes similar generators have flown on 22 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space vehicles, including five manned Apollo moon missions, and that in three instances the well-protected devices survived severe in-flight accidents. Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> has asked the citizens' groups and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to file briefs in the case on Wednesday and Friday, respectively. He set a hearing for Oct. 10, the day the countdown would begin for an Oct. 12 launch. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, one of the three opposing groups, said last week that if the lawsuit is not successful, his organization plans `` to put people into the launch area to sit on top of the launch pad in an effort to stop the launch.''

 Former <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was a strong favorite to reclaim his old job today, while <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Republicans tried to retain a congressional seat that was left vacant when Rep. <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> died in a plane crash. In <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, five candidates battled in a primary election to succeed Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>, who is quitting after a decade in office. Incumbent mayors were running in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N.M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s first black mayor, said he was poised for a `` huge victory'' in his bid to reclaim the seat he held from 1974-82. Few observers expected him to be disappointed. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would succeed <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who followed him in office and who now is exploring a bid for governor. Young, like <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> before him, is prohibited from seeking a third consecutive term. The most prominent among <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s five opponents was former City Councilman <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who entered the race late after <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> dropped out. Further south, two Democrats and a Republican were running in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> special election to fill the seat left vacant by <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s death in August. The freshman Republican had served less than eight months. State Attorney General <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, one of two Democrats running, is the best known of the three candidates and was considered by many to be the front-runner. The others are Republican <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who has been an aide to Sen. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss., and state Sen. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> If no candidate wins a majority, a runoff will be held Oct. 17. The winner will represent an 11 -LCB- - county district in southeastern <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> that has been in Republican hands since 1972 and is the only <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> seat in the state's five-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> delegation So far, Democrats have won four of six special elections to fill <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats this year. In <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>'s departure to run for governor led to a free-for-all among five officeholders. <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON> has endorsed the lone Republican in the race, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Perk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the school board president and son of a former mayor. The other candidates, all Democrats, are Court Clerk <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagan </PERSON> and state Sen. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. The two top vote-getters will advance to the Nov. 7 general election. In <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, three-term incumbent <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> was the favorite in a three-way non-partisan race, but the mayoral election was somewhat overshadowed by a ballot issue on construction of a downtown baseball stadium. Although <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> favored the stadium, polls showed him far in front of two challengers, state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruglick </PERSON> and real estate broker <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> <PERSON> Inman </PERSON>, while the stadium measure was trailing. In <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, Democrat <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> faced eight challengers in his attempt to become the first mayor to be elected to back-to-back terms since the city changed to a mayor-council form of government 15 years ago.

<HEAD>Study: Fat Bubbles Help Fight Lethal Infection in Cancer Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cancer patients who can not be treated for lethal infections with a standard drug may become treatable if the drug is enclosed in microscopic bubbles of fat, a study suggests. The bubbles carry the drug to the sites of infection with less problem from the side effects that now limit its use, said researcher <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez-Berestein </PERSON>. He reported a study of treating patients with the help of the fat bubbles, called liposomes, at an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> science reporters conference Monday. While there are several types of liposomes, the most widely tested consists of multiple layers of fat arranged like the structure of an onion. Liposomes can be used for targeting anti-fungal drugs because they are consumed by white blood cells called macrophages, which infiltrate sites of infection, said <PERSON> Lopez-Berestein </PERSON>, of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. His study involved a powerful anti-fungal drug called amphotericin-B. Its use is limited by its side effects, which include severe chills and fever. Those side effects were less frequent and less severe when the drug was enclosed in liposomes and given to 46 people with infections. Most had become infected as a complication of leukemia, but some were heart transplant patients. Transplant patients are vulnerable to fungal infections because of therapy to suppress their disease-fighting immune systems, which is aimed at keeping them from rejecting their hearts, <PERSON> Lopez-Berestein </PERSON> said. Forty of the study's patients had previously failed to respond to amphotericin-B and other anti-fungal drugs given conventionally, because of allergy or side effects, he said. In the study, 24 patients showed a complete reponse to the liposome-encapsulated drug, remaining free of the infection for six months or more, he said. The 22 other patients failed to respond. The work will be published in a medical journal, he said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higuchi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>, an authority on methods for delivering drugs, called the results interesting. `` It seems to me there are real possibilities there,'' he said in a telephone interview. Treating fungal infections is particularly important in leukemia patients because anti-cancer therapy must be stopped during such infections, <PERSON> Lopez-Berestein </PERSON> said. The cancer treatment inhibits the immune system, encouraging more infections, he said. Liposomes also have been shown to improve effectiveness and reduce side effects of a standard cancer drug in animals, <PERSON> Lopez-Berestein </PERSON> said. They also may prove useful for attacking the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome after it has infected macrophages, he said.

 Thank God for Tuesday garbage pickups. They saved <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiedemann </PERSON> $ 5.2 million. Mrs. <PERSON> Tiedemann </PERSON> had never purchased a lottery ticket before last week, and last weekend she discarded her first ticket stub, thinking she'd lost. But watching a television report Monday, Mrs. <PERSON> Tidemann </PERSON> recognized the winning numbers and fished her ticket from the bottom of the garbage can. Fortunately, pickup was scheduled for today, she said. `` Never in a million years did we expect to win,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Tiedemann </PERSON>, 22. Mrs. <PERSON> Tiedemann </PERSON>, who works in a shoe factory, and her husband, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, told reporters they had no immediate plans on spending the money. `` I have n't the slightest idea. We'll put it into the bank and sit on it,'' said <PERSON> Tiedemann </PERSON>, 26, a machinist. The couple married in April and recently bought a house. Mrs. <PERSON> Tiedemann </PERSON> said she bought the <LOCATION> Lotto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ticket at a convenience store last week, playing the numbers 8 and 18 because they were the month and date of her birthday. The four other numbers _ 26, 30, 42, and 46 _ were selected at random, she said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clausius </PERSON>, a lottery spokesman, said the couple will receive 20 annual installments of $ 192,175 after taxes.

<HEAD>Supreme Court to Consider Rolling Back Miranda Warning Rights</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> boasted about his experience as a killer to two fellow jail inmates who said they wanted to help him escape, he did n't suspect he was incriminating himself in a 2-year-old unsolved murder. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>' statements are the focus of a potentially important <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case that could roll back the rights of criminal suspects to be given so-called Miranda warnings. The high court, beginning what promises to be another controversy-laden term Monday, agreed to use the <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> case from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to decide whether undercover agents may elicit confessions from jailed criminal suspects. The justices said they will hear arguments by <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> officials seeking to use <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>' statements to prosecute him for murder. In its normally busy opening session, the court issued orders in more than 1,000 cases _ denying review to most and agreeing to study 22 that will be among more than 150 disputes to be decided by the end of the term in July. The court heard arguments in a <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, desegregation case in which four city councilmen were held in contempt for opposing a plan for attracting subsidized housing to the city's white neighborhoods. The justices also are looking ahead to a term in which they have agreed to decide thorny right-of-privacy arguments in three abortion disputes and the high court's first `` right to die'' controversy. In other action on the first day of its term, the court: _ Agreed to decide whether police nationwide may use sobriety checkpoints in trying to curb drunken drivers The court will review rulings by <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> courts striking down that state's sobriety checkpoint program as an unconstitutional invasion of privacy Courts in other states have upheld virtually identical police tactics. _ Agreed to use a multimillion dollar dispute over the <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> classic, `` Rear Window,'' to resolve key copyright issues _ Said they will decide in an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case whether public employers may be forced to put aside partisanship when hiring, promoting and transferring employees _ Left intact <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s revocation of a $ 300,000-a-year tax break for a men-only golf club that has counted presidents and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> among its members _ Refused to spare an evangelical Christian group in <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, from having to return $ 5.5 million donated by a wealthy ex-member _ Allowed states to criminally prosecute employers accused of neglecting the health and safety of their employees The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling in an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case that federal workplace regulations do not bar such state prosecutions. In the <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> case, the court could weaken its famous 1966 Miranda ruling that requires police to warn suspects of their right to an attorney and to remain silent. An <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> appeals court ruled in November that police violated <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>' rights when they planted an undercover agent in jail to question him about a murder. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> was charged with fatally shooting <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> on Nov. 8, 1984, in <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>. Police lacked a suspect in the murder in 1986 when <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON>, an inmate at <ORGANIZATION> Graham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hillsboro </LOCATION>, told authorities he had information about the homicide. Police then placed <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> and undercover narcotics officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> on March 31, 1986. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> was being held there awaiting trial on a charge of aggravated battery unrelated to the homicide. <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON>, using the alias <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>, wore motorcycle garb and told <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> he was interested in planning an escape. Then <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> whether he had ever `` done someone,'' a phrase the appeals court said was intended to elicit information about any killings in which <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> took part. The appeals court said <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> recounted in detail the killing of <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON>. A state judge ruled in 1987 that <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>' jailhouse statements to <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON> about the <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> killing could not be admitted as evidence. But state officials said the Miranda ruling only should protect suspects against police coercion, and that there was no coercion in <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>' case. But the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> appeals court said the Miranda ruling applies whenever a suspect is in custody, `` even when the purpose of the custody is unrelated to the purpose of the interrogation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1980 that law enforcement officials can not hire jailhouse informants to induce criminal defendants in custody to make incriminating statements. The justices in that ruling relied on their own 1964 decision _ handed down two years before <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> _ that barred government agents from eliciting incriminating information from defendants entitled to a lawyer's help during interrogation.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached to Stiffen Auto Emission Requirements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Clean air legislation is gaining momentum in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, following a breakthrough agreement that would apply <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s tough auto tailpipe standards to the whole country starting with 1994 models. The 22-0 vote Monday in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> environment subcommittee came after two powerful lawmakers _ Reps. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>. _ shook hands and ended a bitter dispute over the auto <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, the champion of environmental groups, and <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, the auto industry's best friend in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday they would oppose any attempts to change the agreement. Their pact virtually ensures new, tough auto pollution controls because the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s clean air legislation is even stricter than the compromise The auto industry was quick to express its displeasure with the proposed exhaust standards. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON>, chief operating officer for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the standards `` are not feasible and ... would improve air quality by less than 1 percent compared with the president's proposal.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, called the vote `` a genuine step forward'' and `` a signal to the industrial community and others that achieving clean air will take a commitment from all interests to do their part.'' The coalition includes environmental groups and their allies. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> requirements, tougher than the rest of the country's, would be phased in beginning with 1994 models and be complete in the other 49 states by 1996 _ at an average cost to consumers of nearly $ 100 per car, according to <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> estimates. The emissions disputes have helped keep clean air bills in a legislative bottleneck in past years, and threatened to torpedo President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean air bill, which the subcommittee vote amended. The compromise followed extensive private negotiations over the past week that involved <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> and a number of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleagues who said they were tired of a clean air stalemate that has lasted a decade. The last major clean air law changes were passed in 1977. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration accepted the compromise reluctantly and expressed hope for quick progress on other portions of the bill in <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s subcommittee. `` This opens the gates to the passage of clean air legislation _ if not this year then next year,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, who added that the tailpipe compromise would help lawmakers reach agreement on other parts of the legislation. Added Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, `` We still have an enormous amount of work to do.'' White House deputy press secretary <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said the Dingell-Waxman provisions, though tighter than what the president proposed, are `` really not too far away from ours.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would `` have to see what comes out'' of the committee before commenting further. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> said, `` Today's action goes to an extreme which will bring virtually no significant benefits over what the bipartisan bill provides, but will mean huge costs to the consumer and high risks for the industry.'' Following the agreement, lawmakers differing over the makeup of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed clean fuels program for autos intensified efforts to reach a compromise. Also remaining are differences over sharing the cost of acid rain reduction; a `` cap'' on acid rain growth that could slow power plant expansion; and the extent of controls on virtually unregulated airborne toxic chemicals. The Dingell-Waxman agreement is mainly designed to reduce ozone pollution. Motor vehicles account for nearly half of the nation's pollution from ozone, a highly reactive gas that is the prime ingredient of smog and which can cause breathing difficulties Ozone is produced by the reaction of hydrocarbons from unburned fuel with nitrogen oxides, another vehicle pollutant, in the presence of sunlight. Warm weather speeds the reaction. The key provisions of the compromise: _ Beginning with 1994 models, cars and light duty trucks could emit 0.25 grams per mile of non-methane hydrocarbons for five years or 50,000 miles, whichever comes first; and 0.31 grams per mile after that up to 10 years or 100,000 miles The current federal limit on these emissions is 0.41 grams. _ For carbon monoxide, the limit would be 3.4 grams per mile in the five-year, 50,000-mile period, the same as current law; and 4.2 grams after that up to 10 years or 100,000 mile period _ Beginning with 1994 cars and 1995 light-duty trucks, emissions of nitrogen oxides would be held to 0.4 grams per mile, the current <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> limit The standard would be phased in over two years, 40 percent the first year and 100 percent the second. The current federal limit is 1 gram per mile. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> would have to decide by Dec. 31, 1999, whether to tighten the requirements further. If the administrator did nothing, tough standards originally proposed by <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> would take effect automatically Jan. 1, 2003.

<HEAD>Economists Believe Fed Will Resist Pressure to Cut Interest Rates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Interest rates are likely to show little change for the rest of this year despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> for lower rates aimed at boosting economic growth, many economists believe. These analysts look for interest rates, including mortgage rates, to move up and down in a narrow range in coming months as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tries to steer the $ 5 trillion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy along a path of moderating growth and moderating inflation. Policymakers at the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> gathered for a closed-door strategy session today of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, composed of members of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> board in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and five of the 12 <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> regional bank presidents. While the results of their deliberations will not be publicly disclosed for six weeks, many economists were predicting that the central bank will decide to make no changes to its current credit stance. These analysts believe that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is on the verge of achieving its hoped-for soft landing, whereby growth slows just enough in the second half of the year to keep inflation in check but not enough to topple the country into a recession. `` The country is on a moderate but sustainable growth course. It is exactly the kind of low-altitude flying that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been seeking,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer. Because of the belief that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will not fiddle with its monetary controls, analysts were looking for little change in interest rates in coming months. Banks' prime lending rate, which serves as a benchmark for many business and consumer loans, was expected to hold at 10.5 percent. Long-term rates, reflected by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bonds, were expected to trade in a narrow range between 8 percent and 8.5 percent. Mortgage rates, which have been on a roller coaster this year, were expected to stabilize as well, right around the current level of 10.16 percent. Fixed-term mortgages hit a high this year of 11.22 percent in April and fell as low as 9.68 percent in early August before rising slightly in recent weeks. The administration, however, is convinced that further rate declines are needed to improve the economic outlook next year. Both <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, the president's chief economic adviser, have made comments recently about the need for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to lower interest rates. In remarks that were endorsed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> complained that the central bank was keeping interest rates too high and would have to bear the blame if the country topples into a recession next year. The administration apparently is also unhappy because it believes the central bank should be doing more to support last week's agreement by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and six other economic powers to drive the dollar lower as a way of improving <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s huge trade deficit. Lower interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would push the dollar down because dollar-denominated assets would be less attractive to foreign investors. A lower dollar makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports more competitive on overseas markets. `` There is a good deal of domestic political and international heat on the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to ease policy further in order to push the dollar lower to keep exports strong and the economy strong over the remainder of this year and next year,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed, saying, `` This administration wants very much to avoid any slowdown in an election year'' next year when 435 House districts and one-third of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats are at stake. After a yearlong credit-tightening effort, the central bank eased credit slightly in June and July in the face of mounting signs that the record seven-year economic expansion was in danger of faltering. Since that time, however, much of the data on which the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> based its decision has been revised to show the economy was not that weak in the spring and summer. Many economists believe the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would actually be tightening credit now if it had not been for various reports showing that inflation, which spurted ahead early in the year because of higher energy and food costs, was moderating as well. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, an economist with <PERSON> DRI-McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, said she was not looking for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to ease further unless economic growth in the final three months of the year falters much more than is currently expected.

<HEAD>Americans Adopting More Foreign Babies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans are adopting nearly 50 percent more foreign babies than they did a decade ago, a private adoption group says. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adoption </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday the increase was not surprising, with as many as a million American couples unable to have children of their own and only about 50,000 children available for unrelated domestic adoptions. But these adoption also show the underlying altruism of Americans, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said, noting that many foreign children were adopted even when more American babies were available. The rise in foreign adoptions accounted for a large percentage of the overall adoption increase in recent years, he said. Americans adopted 10,019 foreign babies in 1987, the most recent year for which Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> statistics were available. That was a 46 percent increase over 1977 when there were 6,854 foreign adoptions, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> complained that there are children within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who are n't adopted because of `` a new racism'' by adoption agencies. These agencies often try to find parents who match the child, both of the same race, or the same mix as the baby's natural parents. That can result in willing parents being denied a child because they are of a different race, he said. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s comments came as his committee released its `` Adoption Factbook,'' the second such book it has produced, compiling national facts and figures on adoptions, adoption laws and regulations and listing sources of information and help. Other than the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, the federal government no longer collects adoption statistics, said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, so his group is seeking to fill that gap. The committee describes itself as a private organization that encourages adoption but takes no stand on abortion. The first book covered adoptions through 1982, and the new edition brings the figures up to 1986, except for the foreign babies, which include 1987. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said that 7,614 of the 1987 foreign adoptions were from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, while only 122 were from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Females were slightly in the majority at 56 percent. The most common country of origin was <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, he said, and the state where the largest share found new homes was <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 It's time to move from the lab to the marketplace with products such as ink made from soybeans and biodegradable plastics made from corn starch, say two senators whose legislation would speed the process. `` We can make literally thousands of environmentally safe, innovative new products from the renewable resources grown on American farms,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, who has teamed with Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, on the Alternative Agricultural Research and Commercialization Act. The measure combines legislation they had introduced separately. In moving his bill through the last <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> said he found the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` minimally oriented'' toward finding new commercial products for crops. `` Current research being conducted at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> is too often directed at improving yields of existing crops,'' he said Monday, noting problems with overproduction. `` This bill will change that research emphasis and aid in the development of markets for the new products being created.'' `` We can make ink for soybeans instead of petroleum,'' <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> said. `` We can make red dye that wo n't cause cancer out of sunflower hulls. We can make degradable plastics out of corn starch instead of crude oil. We can make insulation from milkweed instead of fiberglass.'' Coincidentally, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crops </ORGANIZATION> is holding a convention this week to exchange ideas on new uses for farm products in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, the home of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s research center doing work in this area The problem with <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s program is unreliable funding. Sometimes there's money and sometimes there is n't. The Conrad-Harkin bill would provide $ 10 million in 1990, $ 20 million in 1991, $ 30 million in 1992, $ 50 million in 1993 and $ 75 million for the next six years. Once research and development are completed, the bill provides for technical and financial assistance to businesses to help commercialize the products through regional centers around the country. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>'s original bill was sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Penny </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., in the House It passed in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but did n't get to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor last year. <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>'s bill passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> three times, but did n't get through the House. The new legislation is widely supported and awaiting hearings in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> aides say the plan is to pass it as separate legislation, but keep open the option of attaching it to the 1990 farm bill.

<HEAD>US Experts Oppose Readmitting Soviets to Psychiatric Association</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soviet efforts to curb psychiatric abuse, including an independent monitoring commission, are not enough to warrant readmitting <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts say. The Soviets recently acknowledged that political and religious dissidents were incarcerated in psychiatric institutions _ a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> charge they long denied _ and in an unusual move sent a diplomat to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to testify about their reforms. The Soviet `` All-Union Scientific Society of Psychiatrists ... is doing its utmost to implement and translate into reality the needed reforms in the field of medical care and psychiatric health,'' said <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Markosov </PERSON>, a counselor at the Soviet Embassy. `` To prevent the use of psychiatry for non-medical purposes as well as to assure maximum openness in specific cases of misuse of psychiatry, an independent commission has been established, which is composed of eight persons,'' <PERSON> Markosov </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health and the environment. `` The commission is independent from the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> or any -LRB- Communist -RRB- Party or state organs,'' he said, reading a statement from the Soviet psychiatric society. Before this year, it was rare for Soviet officials to testify before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but since January, about a half-dozen have done so. Despite the Soviets' effort to present their best case for readmission to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, subcommittee chairman Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has not gone far enough The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Delegation to Assess Soviet Psychiatry, which visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this year, reported to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that `` while some victims have been released, forced incarceration under the guise of treatment for insanity remains an institutional problem,'' <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said. `` Perhaps even worse, the perpetrators of these abuses remain in key leadership positions in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> psychiatry,'' <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said. Besides formation of the independent commission, <PERSON> Markosov </PERSON> detailed reforms including: _ New regulations that led to dropping 736,000 people from so-called psychiatric registration lists <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts said the lists contained 10.2 million names and were used for job screening. _ New rules that bar forcible commitment to a psychiatric institution without the consent of patients or their relatives, unless the patient poses a physical danger `` Psychiatrists who wrongly hospitalize mentally healthy persons may be sentenced to a two-year prison term,'' he said. _ Abolition in the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> federation, the largest of the 15 Soviet republics, of two laws often used against dissidents _ A ban on the use of sulphazine, a drug made of pulverized sulfur that has been injected into political dissidents, causing extreme pain, fever and disorientation Western experts say it has no medical value. Most of the steps had been publicized previously, but the existence of the commission was not known in the West, said another witness, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor who was a member of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation that visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this year. `` It remains to be seen whether it is indeed vigorous and independent,'' said <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which supported the work of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, has voted to oppose readmission of the Soviet group to the world body, which is scheduled to meet in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, on Oct. 11-16. The world body condemned Soviet practices in 1977 and the Soviets withdrew in 1983, facing almost certain expulsion. `` It is my sincere hope as well as the hope of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> that there will be a time in the near future when we can wholeheartedly welcome the <ORGANIZATION> All-Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatrists </ORGANIZATION> and Narcologists of the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> into the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>,'' testified <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>, head of international programs for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> organization. `` It is also our concern that, unfortunately, this time has not yet arrived,'' <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said.

 What does a Soviet husband buy his mother-in-law for her birthday? Radioactive apples from <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>. Stroke patients at <ORGANIZATION> Sunnyview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> got a taste of that not-quite-ready-for-prime-time Soviet humor Monday as a group of humorists from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> delivered one-liners and anecdotes. `` People are people everywhere _ except maybe politicians are different,'' <PERSON> Andrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Benyukh </PERSON>, deputy foreign editor of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> humor magazine <PERSON> Krokodil </PERSON>, told the patients. Five Soviet satirists, cartoonists and editors of monthly humor magazines published in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> are on a two-week visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The program was arranged through a cultural exchange sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureaucrats </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of 1,700 humorists. The Soviets were at the <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION> hospital to see its humor program that's designed to help patients deal with their ailments. The group began its tour Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and arrived in <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> on Saturday for a four-day visit to the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> area. With quips and anecdotes, these observers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> cracked up patients and reporters during an impromptu news conference on the contents of their recently published book, `` Soviet Humor: The Best of Krokodil.'' The collection of cartoons, with English translations, resulted from a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by a group of Soviets in 1987, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, president of the organization. The compilation by 82 cartoonists offers sketches that are political, satirical and, supposedly, funny to all cultures. Take, for instance, the one showing a husband and wife in their living room with the silhouette of a man in the background. The cut line: `` Relax dear, it's not the police. It's just burglars.'' Then of course there was the Soviet variation of the American `` Mother-in-law-in-Trunk'' jokes. A lady is pictured selling two baskets of apples. Crimean apples were trading slowly at a cheap 35 kopecks apiece. But overpriced Chernobyl apples were selling like hotcakes at 5 rubles each. `` People are buying them for their mothers-in-law, their bosses,'' the caption says. The openness under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has allowed <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people to `` take up subjects which, until recently, we could only discuss with our friends in our kitchens ... privately,'' said <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Florentiev </PERSON>, foreign editor of <LOCATION> Krokodil </LOCATION>. He urged <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to continue to extend those freedoms. `` If you stop at this stage, it can easily be turned the other way around. You have to go ahead to achieve some positive results,'' <PERSON> Florentiev </PERSON> said.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says Soviet officials are `` misreading the tea leaves'' if they think the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is lessening its commitment to the Strategic Defense Initiative. `` They better go back and read what we said and what the SDI program is all about now,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Monday. The vice president created a stir last month when he said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had indulged in `` political jargon'' when it originally portrayed the SDI program _ also known as <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> _ as a leak-proof, impenetrable anti-missile shield. The Soviets, in their latest strategic arms initiative, conditionally dropped their insistence that Americans abandon plans to deploy a space-based anti-missile system. But they reserved the right to abrogate a strategic arms agreement on short notice if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ever actually deployed such a system. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and other news organizations, said the concept of SDI had been scaled back in the last 12 months of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` What we're talking about is a realistic SDI system,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` If -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- view a phased deployment and a redefinition of SDI as lessening of the commitment, they're misreading the tea leaves `` It's showing you can do it from a political point of view, from a technological point of view and that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is serious about an SDI system,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a stalwart SDI supporter. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who returned Friday from a four-nation tour of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration may ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to loosen restrictions on foreign aid to allow the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to beef up internal security against communist insurgents. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was instrumental in securing a similar waiver for <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> after a visit to that strife-torn nation earlier this year. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said a waiver of the restriction would `` help protect American lives as we have become increasing targets'' in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Two Americans working at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military base were ambushed and killed by Filipino terrorists shortly before <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s arrival last Tuesday The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> will receive almost $ 650 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid next year. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did not say how much he felt should be shifted to internal security, but aides said the country needs basic equipment including two-way radios for police cars in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> agreed during <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit to open negotiations in December on the lease agreements for <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> naval station and four other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military facilities Those agreements expire in September 1991. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hopes for a long-term, indefinite extension of the leases. Setting a date for closing the bases would send the wrong signal to investors looking for signs of stability in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, he said. `` There is a very vocal anti-American community in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I do n't put everyone that's anti-American in the terrorist camp ... It's a combination of anti-Americanism plus pro-Philippine and self-respect and self-dignity.'' But just `` traveling the streets of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'' and seeing its poverty underscores the need for economic development, he said. `` I think we are a stabilizing force in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and stability is what investors and people look to,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who also visited <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> on his fourth foreign trip of the year. On other issues, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>: _ Shrugged off a question about his low standing in public opinion polls `` I'm gratified for the president's good standing in polls. That's my concern right now. I got plenty of time to worry about my own,'' said the 44-year-old vice president. _ Declared the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' main goal in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is to bolster the non-communist resistance and prevent the `` mass murderers'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from regaining power _ Said the government of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must change its attitude about the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square last June `` The problem is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> continues to perceive that nothing happened, or whatever happened is nobody's business, and therefore it's for us to change, not them,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Bush's Steel Import Plan Moves to Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The extension of steel import restraints, once a contentious issue in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, is all but assured after an overwhelming <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote to extend restrictions until 1992. Monday's 354-10 vote approved President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s compromise to extend the restrictions on 29 foreign trading partners until April 1992. The `` no'' votes were all Republicans. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., has introduced a companion measure in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where bipartisan approval is expected soon <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan, announced July 25, called for immediate negotiations with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and other leading steel-exporting nations to extend annual limitations on the volume of steel allowed into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The original pacts, which expired Saturday, were negotiated by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1984 to give domestic steelmakers breathing space from subsidized, foreign competition. Many steel-district lawmakers pushed the administration to extend the curbs for another five years, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opted for a smaller-scale, 2 -LCB- - year program in deference to steel-using manufacturers The manufacturers argued that the quotas have driven up prices and caused supply shortages of some steel products. The manufacturers had enlisted dozens of lawmakers prepared to argue against a five-year continuation, but the compromise all but eliminated the debate. House opposition came largely from free-traders who felt the steel industry has had enough protection. `` It's not my first choice,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., who had opposed a longer extension `` Nevertheless, I have to admit it's about as good a compromise as could be achieved.'' Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaydos </PERSON>, D-Pa., who represents a western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> steel district, said the program `` is not a cure-all, but has been the most effective method of dealing with dumped imports. `` This legislation is basically and fundamentally giving the steel industry in this country a little more time to become competitive. And they're well under way,'' <PERSON> Gaydos </PERSON> said. With the old program due to expire Sept. 30, the administration could not afford to wait until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acted to begin the painstaking process of negotiating new import ceilings. Trade representatives from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> were in town last week for meetings on renewing their pacts. Many of the negotiations are already complete, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>. Even though <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has n't finished work on the bill, she said steel imports would continue to be monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. No details on individual pacts have been announced. In a prepared statement Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> applauded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators for their work but stressed that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> program should not preclude American steelmakers from filing unfair trade complaints, if necessary, against foreign governments. Voting against the bill were Republicans <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Armey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrbacher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolbe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stump </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Petri </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Texas School Financing Declared Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK KEEVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A ruling that the funding of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> schools is unconstitutional will mean a chance at equality for poorer districts in the nation's second-largest school system, a lawyer in the case says. The state's education commissioner, who had defended the financing system, called for a tax increase so poorer districts can `` equalize upward.'' But Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> said more money wo n't necessarily solve the problem Monday's unanimous 9-0 decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> found `` glaring disparities'' between rich and poor school districts, violating a requirement in the state Constitution for an `` efficient system'' of public schools. The court said financing for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' 3.3 million students must be overhauled by May. `` A remedy is long overdue,'' Justice <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauzy </PERSON>'s opinion said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> must take immediate action.'' <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> said he will call a special 30-day session of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in the spring to grapple with the problem after a task force still to be named makes its recommendations. The court said it would not tell the Legislature how to correct the inequities or order it to increase taxes, but warned: `` A Band-Aid will not suffice; the system itself must be changed.'' The state, whose school system follows <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as the nation's largest, will make nearly $ 10 billion available for public schools in 1990-91, and almost $ 12 billion is expected from local districts. But because of disparities in property wealth, annual spending per student among districts ranges from $ 2,112 to $ 19,333, the court said. Schools are funded with local property taxes and state aid. In 1988, Comptroller <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> found 730 of the 1,100 districts spend less than the statewide average of $ 3,290 per student per year. The average in those districts was $ 2,976. An <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> state district judge had declared the system unconstitutional in a 1984 case brought by poor districts against state Education Commissioner W.N. <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> and others. That ruling was overturned last December by a 2-1 vote of the Austin-based <ORGANIZATION> 3rd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. But the high court found `` the state's school financing system is neither financially efficient, nor efficient in the sense of providing for a ` general diffusion of knowledge' statewide.'' The ruling prompted celebrations in <ORGANIZATION> Edgewood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, the lead plaintiff. `` We took on the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and we beat'em,'' said Superintendent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>. About 1,800 students and teachers rallied at the <LOCATION> Edgewood </LOCATION> stadium, holding banners reading `` Victory'' and `` Edgewood All the Way'' as a band played. A marquee at the entrance read, `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Children 9, <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> 0.'' The ruling `` is going to mean a chance at equality,'' said attorney <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Educational Fund, who represented <LOCATION> Edgewood </LOCATION> and several other districts. <PERSON> Demetrio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who launched a fight for equal school funding in 1968 that reached the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> before it was rejected, said he cried when he heard of the ruling: `` It really is something that has been in my heart.'' <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said that although his position as education commissioner required him to defend the financing system in court, he had always maintained it was inadequate. `` We simply must have bold leadership to make the tough decision of increasing revenue so that we equalize upward ... to the level of a quality education for all children,'' <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said. The governor was more cautious, though. `` It could be that we maybe need more money, but money in itself is not the answer to public education,'' <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> said. `` Quality education is the issue here.'' Attorney <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>, who represented several affluent districts that intervened in support of the state, expressed disappointment. `` We were hoping the court would consider it as a legislative problem and ... hold that, while the legislative solution was not perfect, it was constitutional,'' <PERSON> Luna </PERSON> said. In its ruling, the court rejected arguments that reform in school finance will reduce local control of education. `` An efficient system will actually allow for more local control, not less,'' the court said. `` It will provide property-poor districts with economic alternatives that are not now available to them.'' The opinion noted that similar rulings have been made in nine other states. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is one of 11 states where school financing systems have been challenged. Other states with active lawsuits or court orders concerning school finance are <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was in prison on the fifth anniversary of his arrest even though his conviction and life sentence for conspiring to commit espionage for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been dismissed. `` I think there's something very wrong with a system that allows a man to be held five years without a fair trial,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, said A 20-year <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> veteran, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was arrested five years ago Monday. He was subsequently convicted _ after two trials _ on charges of delivering secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> documents to his lover, <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>. His first trial ended in a hung jury. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> to two life terms plus 50 years. But in April, the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed the conviction, ruling that <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> had erred in allowing lie detector evidence during the 1985-86 trial. The panel ordered a new trial for <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. In July, <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> refused a defense motion to release <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> on bail pending the outcome of a government appeal. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was a flight risk. In August, the appeals court refused to reconsider its decision. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys had the choice of appealing to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> or prosecuting again in district court. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Haymen </PERSON>, who helped prosecute <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, did not immediately return telephone calls seeking comment Monday. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the only <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent ever convicted of espionage, spends his time in prison taking computer classes and waiting to see whether the government will try him again. `` He seems to be holding up better than you or I would,'' <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said. `` He is a very stoic kind of fellow who takes what comes his way, or goes with the flow, to use one of his expressions.'' At his trials, prosecutors depicted <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> as a bitter and vengeful man who was repeatedly reprimanded for ineptitude on the job. They said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was easily recruited the summer of 1984 by <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Nikolay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>, Soviet emigres living in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. On Sept. 27, 1984, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> walked into an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office and confessed to having a relationship with Mrs. <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>. He contended that he was trying to redeem his career by infiltrating the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. For the next four days, testimony revealed, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> underwent grilling by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents while Mrs. <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> made frantic calls to his <LOCATION> Lynwood </LOCATION> home and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, trying to find him. The two had planned a trip to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to meet with Soviet intelligence agents, prosecutors charged. He was placed under arrest Oct. 2, 1984. The Ogorodnikovs, as co-defendants, pleaded guilty and are serving time in federal prison. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said he was confident <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> would get a new trial or reach a `` realistic solution'' with the government. `` I think the government has always blown this case far out of proportion to what it really is,'' <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said. `` We're hopeful as we start down the road again that there will be a more realistic solution.'' From prison, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> writes frequently to his children, most of whom have struck out on their own since his arrest, <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said he also receives `` nice phone calls and Christmas cards'' from the Ogorodnikovs. `` <PERSON> Nikolay </PERSON>'s very excited. He thinks he's going to get a new trial if <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> gets his again. But he pleaded guilty,'' <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said. `` His biggest crime was being married to <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON>.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> have normalized relations 12 years after the African nation switched recognition from <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> to the rival Communist government in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, officials say. The late Monday night announcement by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Lien </PERSON> <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> represents a breakthrough for the Nationalist government's new flexible policy of seeking diplomatic ties with countries that already have relations with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lien </PERSON> attributed <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s diplomatic victory to its `` making more progress politically, economically and socially'' than Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, quoting unnamed sources, said <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> had agreed to offer <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> a $ 200 million loan. Foreign Ministry officials declined comment. The re-establishment of ties between <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> comes three months after <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> established ties with <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> subsequently suspended diplomatic relations with the tiny <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island. There was no immediate reaction from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>'s decision <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s latest moves come after decades of diplomatic reversals in which the overwhelming majority of nations chose to recognize the Communists in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> instead of the Nationalists in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>. Both governments have claimed to be the legitimate ruler of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the Communists defeated the Nationalists in a civil war that ended in 1949. The number of countries with formal ties to the Nationalist government has dropped from more than 50 in 1949 to 24, not including <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, which is among the 134 countries that recognize <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> told a news conference Monday night that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> would sign a formal communique on setting up diplomatic ties in a few days. The two countries agreed to pursue normalization in January, he said. Communist Chinese leaders have criticized <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s flexible diplomacy as a plan to promote two separate Chinas, a claim the Nationalist officials deny. <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, with a population of 2.5 million, is an agricultural country that relies on the exports of coffee, lumber and rubber. <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> imported $ 24 million of industrial products from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1988. Its exports to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> totaled $ 270,000.

The Times will cease publication Nov. 30, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said Monday. An internal task force that reviewed the performance of both papers, reader preferences and other factors recommended closing the Times as part of a plan to expand and improve The News & amp; Observer, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. Afternoon dailies across the country have been in decline in recent years as publishers have found it increasingly difficult to make timely delivery to the suburbs and readers have opted for television news in the evening. The News & amp; Observer has a daily circulation of 145,000, compared with the Times' 21,500. `` Just not enough people wanted to read it,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. `` I thought it was a daggone good newspaper.'' `` For several years, we have watched as afternoon dailies in metropolitan areas closed,'' the publisher said. `` We can not make the improvements The News & amp; Observer needs and still publish a quality afternoon newspaper.'' The additional staff will be used to improve The News & amp; Observer's coverage of surrounding <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. That and other improvements could not be made as long as the Times was being published, he said. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said no layoffs are expected. The news staffs of the papers were combined in 1987. The Times began in 1879 as the Raleigh Evening Visitor. After merging with two competitors, it was renamed The <ORGANIZATION> Raleigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in 1901. The Park family of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> purchased <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in 1911, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> A.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is recommending a major improvement in benefits for the most affluent 10 percent of Social Security recipients who continue to work after retirement. The panel, which is writing a bill designed chiefly to reduce the budget deficit, has agreed informally to raise by about $ 5,600 the maximum amount a person between the ages of 65 and 69 may earn without having to give up a portion of Social Security benefits. That would boost the earnings limitation to about $ 14,500 a year, committee Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told reporters Monday. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the committee, which was scheduled to begin work this afternoon, had not resolved the two thorniest issues: whether to reduce the tax on capital gains and whether <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic insurance protection for retirees should be repealed or only cut back. `` The -LRB- capital-gains -RRB- measure as passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and supported by the administration will not in my opinion pass the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or the committee,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. Several members of the committee have suggested alternative capital-gains taxes. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he was `` making no assumptions'' as to whether any of those will be approved. The committee, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, is firmly behind allowing people between the ages of 65 and 69 to earn more without losing a part of their Social Security check. According to congressional aides, the earnings limitation affects only about 10 percent of Social Security recipients. In 1986, only 600,000 beneficiaries had their Social Security checks reduced because of earnings. The remaining 90 percent either did not work or had wages below the exempt amount. Present law permits a person between 65 and 69 to earn up to $ 8,880 in 1989 without losing benefits. The pensioner loses $ 1 in benefits for each $ 2 earned above that level. The earnings limitation rises each year with inflation, and starting in 1990, recipients will lose $ 1 for each $ 3 earned above the limitation. Under the committee's tentative action, the earnings limitation would be increased by about $ 2,800 in 1990 and $ 2,800 in 1991 in place of the much smaller inflation adjustment. According to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, that would raise the maximum earnings limit to about $ 14,500 in 1991. For the next $ 5,000 of wages, the pensioner would lose $ 1 for each $ 4 of additional earnings. A person 70 and older loses no Social Security benefit no matter how much is earned. Beneficiaries under 65 may earn up to $ 6,480 without giving up any part of the Social Security check. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has voted to raise the earnings limit for ages 65 through 69 to $ 9,720 in 1990 and $ 10,440 in 1991.

 The commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surface </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a disciplinary inquiry aboard the USS Iowa, the battleship on which 47 sailors were killed in an April explosion, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources say. Vice Adm. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnell </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is conducting the non-judicial inquiry to determine whether the captain and several other officers should be punished, the sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said after a lengthy study that gunner's mate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> `` most likely'' caused the explosion in the battleship's No 2 gun turret by inserting a detonator between two powder bags But the investigation led by Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> also alleged numerous lax procedures aboard the ship, including unauthorized experimentation with extra-strength gunpowder and projectile loads. <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> said the officers had failed to qualify enough sailors for their specific duties in the gun turret and that many safety procedures had been circumvented. He recommended that Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> and four other high-ranking men be relieved and disciplined. However, his superiors decided the men should receive non-judicial punishment through the mast procedure. <PERSON> Donnell </PERSON>, who was one of the endorsing officers of the final <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> report, countered <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>'s recommendation that the five men be removed, arguing that the infractions amounted to `` a failure of leadership'' on the captain's part but were `` a marked departure from otherwise outstanding performance.'' <PERSON> Donnell </PERSON> is expected to conduct his inquiries separately for each of the men, and the procedures are expected to last several days, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> source said. The USS Iowa is in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. Besides <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, the men include the ship's executive officer, the weapons officer and a master chief petty officer who was found to have experimented with the gun firings. The gunnery officer requested and received a transfer. A separate procedure is expected to be conducted for him later, the source said.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration says it hopes the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will help restart the stalled peace process in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and ease the threat of revived civil war there. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs, spoke of a `` more constructive Soviet role'' in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> after recent `` useful discussions about <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'' with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. Testifying before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations subcommittee Monday, <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON> defended the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of seeking a settlement in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by backing Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and continued political and diplomatic isolation of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>NIH Says Veterinary Drug Offers Hope to Colon Cancer Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> says a drug used to fight worms in farm animals may be an important new device against colon cancer in humans. `` I think this is an important advance,'' Dr. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Broder </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> said Monday in announcing strong results for the drug when used in combination with an anti-cancer drug. `` We might now be able to reduce the death rate due to colon cancer by as much as one third.'' <PERSON> Levamisole </PERSON>, a drug widely used to remove worms from the intestinal tract of cows, horses, goats, sheep and even elephants, was used with a cancer drug to dramatically increase the survival rate among colon cancer patients, <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The levamisole was used in combination with 5-fluorouracil. Levamisole is not approved for human medical treatment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and currently is available to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> physicians only through a <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> research program approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The drug, developed by a <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> pharmaceutical firm, is used in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, however, to treat intestinal parasites in humans. The other drug, 5-fluorouracil, or 5-FU, has been a standard in chemotherapy for some cancers for 30 years. The drug combination was used successfully in a small clinical test and then expanded to a national clinical trial involving about 1,300 patients, under the direction of Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moertel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> sponsored the national trial. <PERSON> Moertel </PERSON> said the findings showed that colon cancer patients at an advanced stage of the disease called <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> C experienced about a one-third reduction in death and cancer recurrence after five years when compared to patients who received either no drugs or levamisole alone. He said previous studies showed that 5-FU had no effect on colon cancer. It was only the combination, said <PERSON> Moertel </PERSON>, that gave `` a significant reduction in the death rate.'' Just how the two drugs work together is not now understood, <PERSON> Moertel </PERSON> said. Until now, there has been virtually no successful treatment available for <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> C colon cancer patients, he said. Duke C, or stage III of colon cancer, is named for a physician who first characterized the progress of the disease. At this stage, the cancer has penetrated the colon wall and spread to the lymph nodes, but there are no tumor cells detected in other organs. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> C patients also have had the obvious tumors removed surgically, along with the nearby lymph nodes. <PERSON> Broder </PERSON> said that about 110,000 patients a year are diagnosed with colon cancer and 44,000 will die of the disease. About 21,000 of those deaths will be among patients who first received treatment at the Duke C stage of the disease, he said. In the past, he said, medical science could offer such patients only surgery and regular examinations to monitor the disease progress. Five-year survival rate for these patients is 30 percent to 40 percent. Among Duke C patients receiving the drug combination, 49 percent were alive with no detected cancer recurrence after five years. Among patients in the study treated with surgery solely, the survival rate was 37 percent, he said. <PERSON> Moertel </PERSON> said the treatment has not been demonstrated to be effective in other stages of the disease.

 With a Thursday deadline at hand, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> are exerting heavy pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to go along with a proposal for preliminary peace talks with Palestinian representatives. Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> sounded upbeat Monday about prospects for a peace settlement, saying a `` golden opportunity'' exists that must not be squandered. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who has been campaigning hard for a more flexible <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> position on the issue, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should not feel threatened by the 10-point proposal for peace talks set forth by <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. The inner cabinet of ministers from <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor is to meet Thursday on <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s ideas amid deep divisions on how to proceed. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> rejects <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s acceptance of a U.S.-backed formula that involves trading occupied land for peace and including people deported by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> negotiating delegation. Labor, led by Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, supports both ideas. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> told reporters the essential next step in the peace process is to persuade the Israelis and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to enter a dialogue `` without preconditions.'' `` We wo n't get to peace until Palestinians and Israelis speak to each other,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> regards the <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> plan as a complement to _ not a substitite for _ <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal for elections in which Palestinians would select representatives to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on limited self-government in the occupied territories. Monday's White House session came amid new concern that settling Jewish immigrants from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> could threaten peace efforts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials reacted coolly to an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> request for $ 400 million in housing loan guarantees for about 100,000 Jewish emigres from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have said some dwellings probably will be in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> policy is to oppose additional settlements in the occupied territories,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ability to assist <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is limited by `` severe budgetary constraints.''

 A medical research laboratory targeted by animal welfare activists faces a $ 2,500 for harassing two <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> inspectors at the facility during a 1987 visit. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief administrative judge, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, on Monday ordered <ORGANIZATION> Sema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to comply with `` every provision of the Animal Welfare Act'' and not to interfere with federal inspections. Animal rights activists claim the suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lab mistreats its chimpanzees and other animals used in viral research under contract with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. The two veterinary inspectors who work for the <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said company employees prevented them from taking pictures of cages, decoding information about the animals and driving away from the lab on June 29, 1987. In a follow-up report at the lab, the inspectors reported finding deficiencies in sanitation that were `` suggestive of violations'' of regulations, but concluded <ORGANIZATION> Sema </ORGANIZATION> did not violate the welfare act. <ORGANIZATION> Sema </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> and his attorney declined comment on the order until they saw it writing. The company has 35 days to appeal the decision. People for the <ORGANIZATION> Ethical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, has publicly shown films it claims were taken at <ORGANIZATION> Sema </ORGANIZATION> during a burglary, allegedly by an underground animal rights group. Chimpanzee researcher <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodall </PERSON> has also publicly criticized the company about the size of cages and other treatment of chimps there. <ORGANIZATION> Sema </ORGANIZATION> had a $ 1.5 million-a-year contract with <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> for research into simian AIDS and hepatitis at the end of last year and was conducting experiments on nearly 500 monkeys, chimpanzees, woodchucks and other animals. <ORGANIZATION> PETA </ORGANIZATION> has long complained that <ORGANIZATION> Sema </ORGANIZATION> has one of the highest mortality rates for its animals in the country, but the company denies that allegation.

 The dollar closed higher against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Tuesday despite intervention by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank, while stock prices slipped. The dollar opened at 139.72 yen, up 0.42 yen from Monday's close of 139.30 yen, and closed at 140.65 yen, up 1.35 yen. It traded in a range of 139.70 to 140.68 yen. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the 225-share <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> lost 256.60 points, or 0.72 percent, to close at 35,366.37 points. Currency traders said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> intervened several times, selling dollars for yen at about the 140-yen level. `` The dollar was moving slightly upward as market players corrected their dollar-holding positions,'' said a trader with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said participants were buying back dollars they had sold earlier, following talks last week among monetary officials from seven key currency nations, known as the Group of Seven. The officials agreed to strengthen coordinated monetary intervention to push the dollar lower. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> investors were focusing on selling West German marks and buying the yen, thus helping the dollar to strengthen against other major currencies, the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trader said. But he said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> was likely to prevent a further rise in the dollar. The amount of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s purchases was not immediately known. The central bank does not normally comment officially on its market intervention. On the stock exchange, traders said many participants stayed on the sidelines watching the currency market. Dealers said the weakening yen discouraged Japanese investors, and the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index fell as they sold to take profits. An analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Yamaichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition of anonmyity, said institutional investors also held back because of a lack of trading focus.

<HEAD>Drama Over Marcos Body Part Of Filipino Political Tradition</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The standoff over where to bury <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is the latest example of `` body politics'' _ a Filipino game <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s supporters once played themselves to rally a nation and topple a dictator. Rules of the game demand protracted wakes, vigils and novenas. Players include grieving relatives who regale reporters, television audiences and crowds of spectators with tales of injustice and appeals to respect Filipino tradition. The object is to play on the Filipino's almost mystical respect for the dead to promote the cause of the deceased and the fortunes of the living. Since <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> died Thursday in exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> radio and television stations and newspapers have in daily reports showed the grieving widow, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, standing before the former president's open coffin. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has vowed to do all she can to return her husband's remains to his homeland, despite President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s refusal to allow his burial here `` I also ask for your prayers to give me strength to that I will see the victory of my struggle to clear the name of President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and the whole nation,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said in a radio interview broadcast here today. The scene in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> is an ironic parody of the events of six years ago, after Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s husband, Sen. <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was murdered moments after returning from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to challenge <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. After the Aug. 21, 1983 slaying, the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> family held a nine-day wake during which thousands of people filed by to view the body, still dressed in the blood-soaked clothes in which <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> died. Perhaps two million people turned out for the funeral, as <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s body was paraded over a 19-mile route aboard a 10-wheel flatbed truck. The outrage over the killing galvanized anti-Marcos sentiment and paved the way for the uprising which toppled the longtime president and propelled <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s widow into the presidency on Feb. 25, 1986. Body politics has been played by lesser figures too. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, died on May 4, 1988. But <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' followers hoped to use her death to dramatize their leader's exile and embarass the government into allowing him to return. The ploy failed. Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> remains unburied, lying in an open casket in <LOCATION> Batac </LOCATION>, 250 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Die-hard <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' loyalists carry on a vigil which has been largely forgotten. The military has also discovered the merits of body politics in its campaign to discredit the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is waging a 20-year insurgency. Under <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, the military tried to hide figures on the number of soldiers killed by both Communist insurgents and Moslem guerrillas in the south. But no more. On Sept. 3, rebels killed 13 soldiers working on a highway construction project in <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> province. As commanders spoke of this `` outrage,'' television cameras panned the flag-draped corpses and grieving widows. The military also claims the rebels have been carrying out a protracted purge of their ranks and have killed scores of party members suspected of disloyalty. With the discovery of every `` killing field'' _ where rebels allegedly bury the victims _ the military encourages television cameras to film as bones are unearthed from shallow graves. At dinner-hour newscasts, Filipinos watch as elderly peasants weep over the bones, supposedly of their sons and daughters `` executed'' by the rebels.

<HEAD>School to Teach Better Race Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CASSANDRA BURRELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A middle school has transformed itself into a laboratory on ways to improve race relations where teachers hope to erase past tensions and perhaps serve as a model for the rest of the nation. `` Some kids' cultural upbringing is different. Some of it is unconscious. We need to learn to understand each other better,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pipkin </PERSON>, principal of the <ORGANIZATION> Prospect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multiracial </ORGANIZATION>, Multi-ethnic and Multicultural Education. Prospect teachers _ and their sixth -, seventh - and eighth-grade students _ are learning the fine points of dealing with whites, blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and Native The students, split almost evenly among whites and blacks, will learn about the cultures of other races and ethnic groups in hope they will find their differences enlightening rather than divisive. The school, in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s racially balanced <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> section, will retain its traditional curriculum, but also will teach students to recognize racism and its consequences. Teachers also will try to provide lessons free of racial bias. Another part of the program could prove more controversial. Since some studies indicate children of different races and cultural backgrounds have different learning styles, teachers will be taught to expand their repertoire of teaching methods, said psychologist <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Denton </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>'s director of multicultural education `` White children tend to be abstract learners. In the area of mathematics, for example, they can learn by being exposed to a formula,'' <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> said. Black children, in general, learn best when the lesson is embedded within a context or accompanied by examples, he said. `` This is an oversimplification, of course,'' he said. `` There are always wide variations and exceptions.'' Attempts to put these theories to work elsewhere have offended blacks. `` People tend to equate abstract learning with higher thinking, which is n't the case at all,'' <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> said. Administrators hope the program will generate new ideas that can be used in other schools in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and, perhaps, across the country. `` We want a program that will celebrate diversity and encourage kids to be proud of their background and knowledgeable about their cultural heritage,'' <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> said. The first year of the program will involve mostly training and planning. Next September, however, the center will begin projects designed to enhance students' self-esteem, teach the histories of different minorities and sensitize teachers to their own racial attitudes. About 52 percent of the district's 39,500 students are black and 47 percent are white. One percent come from other minority groups. Of Prospect's 625 students, 48 percent are black. The district invited teachers to apply to work in the new program, and 90 percent of Prospect's teachers and staff are new to the school. This year 35 percent, or 21, of the school's 59 full-time teachers are black and the rest are white. The idea for the changes sprang from a study that found black male students in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> got suspended from schools more often than others. `` We also had a couple of incidents of racism,'' <PERSON> Pipkin </PERSON> said. `` We had some teachers making blatant remarks about Afro-American kids and episodes between back and while students _ some racial name calling.'' Changes also were suggested by business and community advisers concerned about black students' complaints of racial harassment at colleges and universities, including <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, who took her name from a slip of paper in her pocket when she showed up here in December with little memory, discovered she probably is <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellish </PERSON>, a divorced mother of three from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Investigators who struggled all year to help the black-haired, brown-eyed woman find her true identity got a break Monday in the form of a missing person report from <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, said Detective <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON>. The discovery led to a phone conversation between `` Kitty'' and <PERSON> Elise </PERSON> <PERSON> Shite </PERSON>, a sister of <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellish </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, authorities said. `` She definitely feels that I am -LRB- <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellish </PERSON> -RRB-,'' the mystery woman said Monday night. `` She and our mother are coming down on Wednesday morning. ... I do n't know if I'll go back with them or not,'' said the woman who still calls herself <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> said his office was fairly certain <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> is 50-year-old <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellish </PERSON>, based on information provided by the <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and on her sister's recognition of <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>'s voice. Ms. <PERSON> Ellish </PERSON> disappeared from <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> on Dec. 8. Two days later, the mystery woman woke up in a <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> motel with a headache and bruises on one eye, her arms and legs. `` As to what happened and how I got here, we still do n't know,'' she said. `` There's a 24 - to 48-hour period that's still not accounted for. She said her newfound family told her <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellish </PERSON> had been under a great deal of pressure, most recently because of `` personal problems'' with her 18-year-old daughter. `` They said I had been suffering from migraine headaches. That's about as much as we know at this point,'' she said <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> police appealed for help from the public last week, saying they had exhausted all leads. Since then, they have followed up on dozens of tips from people who read articles about <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, whom doctors believe has amnesia. <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>'s only recollections were `` bits and pieces'' about an abusive ex-husband, working in an office with computers and seeing the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> skyline. `` She does want to remember and just ca n't,'' an exasperated Lt. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said last week. On Monday, authorities filled <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> in on details of the life of <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellish </PERSON>, showing her pictures sent from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> of the woman, her daughter and her two sons, ages 29 and 20. `` Right now to me, they're still just a bunch of strangers,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Ellish </PERSON> was a computer analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Alltel-Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>. `` The police gave me a good deal of information this morning which I could n't remember,'' she said. `` Some of what they said just absolutely went over my head. I think I was still in shock. My mind is n't absorbing these things.'' She spoke from the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a private women's shelter where she has lived and worked as a cook. The mystery woman said she would n't decide about her future until talking with her counselors and meeting the family of Ms. <PERSON> Ellish </PERSON>. `` I'm still apprehensive,'' she said. `` I just do n't know what's back there for me.

 Automakers criticized a congressional proposal to extend <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s tough auto exhaust standards to the entire country as needlessly expensive and of doubtful value. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> rules `` were adopted for a unique part of the country with a unique problem,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Noack </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s media relations office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Why bring standards for that part of the country nationwide when the need for them is not there?'' The proposal emerged Monday from a subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on a 22-0 vote. It virtually assures some form of tough new tailpipe emission controls, because the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s clean air legislation is even stricter. Under the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan, passed as a proposed amendment to a clean air bill put forth by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, California-style controls would be phased in beginning with 1994 models and be in effect in all states by 1996. <PERSON> Noack </PERSON> said the subcommittee plan would n't make the air any cleaner than the administration plan, but will cost the consumer more. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has estimated the additional emission controls would add $ 100 to the cost of each car. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Vice Chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> said his company supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, despite some reservations `` However, this action goes well beyond that proposal,'' <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> said of the subcommittee plan. Though the provisions would make auto standards far more stringent, they would improve air quality a mere 1 percent compared with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, he said. <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> also said there are serious safety questions about vapor recovery systems that would be mandated under the provisions. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> also criticized subcommittee proposal. `` First, the proposed standards stretch the limits of technological feasibility, and we presently lack assurance that these standards can be met at the levels of reliability and quality the American public demands,'' <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucksbaum </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, praised the proposal. `` We're very encouraged by this compromise,'' <PERSON> Bucksbaum </PERSON> said. `` It's an excellent first step particularly in area of controlling smaller pollutants.''

<HEAD>Government Orders Probe Into Shipwreck Tale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government ordered a probe today into why searchers failed to find any trace of a capsized yacht whose crew claims to have drifted four months off <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> before being washed ashore. `` There are many discrepancies in their story,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> Search and Rescue. The four say their 42-foot trimaran capsized in a storm June 3 and that they survived the 121-day ordeal huddled in the overturned craft by spearing fish, eating seaweed and trapping rainwater. The four turned up over the weekend on <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, but some officials have expressed skepticism about their story, saying they appear too healthy. `` We needed a miracle and we got one,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glennie </PERSON>, skipper of the sailboat, the <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Noelle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Glennie </PERSON> said the trimaran left <LOCATION> Picton </LOCATION>, on the northern coast of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, on June 1 for a three-week <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> islands cruise to the Polynesian kingdom of <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION>. He told authorities the boat was flipped over by a huge wave in a 60-knot wind on the third day of the journey and that the four activated an emergency beacon after scrambling to retrieve radio equipment, flares, clothing and food. `` It's an amazing story,'' said <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>. `` The area the yachtsmen say they were in when they made their last radio message was not anywhere near where the search was done.'' The inquiry was announced by Transport Minister <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffries </PERSON>, whose responsibilities include the Marine Division in charge of sea rescue operations. <PERSON> Jeffries </PERSON> told reporters his department wanted to clarify why the boat was apparenty hundreds of miles from where its distress signal was sent and why the yacht's emergency beacon apparently operated for a week well within range of an aircraft monitoring service without being detected. `` They say they were just off the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> coast but the radio message we had put them hundreds of miles away at the <LOCATION> Kermadec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, nearer <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said. `` It was a very big area to cover.'' <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, a Marine Division official, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> there was some confusion about when and where the boat capsized. `` It is curious,'' he said. `` Based on winds and sea currents, it would make more sense if they were further north.'' <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said the yacht was smashed on the rocky coast of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION>, after the crew made landfall on Sunday. He said the inquiry was normal procedure. The crew included owner and skipper <PERSON> Glennie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hellriegal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nalepka </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Glennie </PERSON>, responding to suspicions today the crew was too healthy to have survived such an ordeal, told reporters: `` It's not a hoax.'' The crew members emerged Monday but without the salt water sores typical of extended seawater exposure. <PERSON> Hellriegel </PERSON>, reunited with his family, breakfasted today on bacon, eggs and mushrooms washed down with fresh coffee, said the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zealand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

The measure's estimated cost is $ 800 million, the highest figure in the agency's history, The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-Constitution </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The regulations are needed because a `` cavalier attitude'' toward infections is increasing the danger of sickness and death among health workers, said Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coggin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a consultant to <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>. An estimated 5.3 million nurses, police officers, ambulance drivers, embalmers, firefighters and prison guards would be covered by the regulations. `` In spite of a barrage of literature about the modern dangers of laboratory-acquired infections and how to prevent them, workers in the average laboratory today fail to faithfully wear protective clothing, gloves and face shields,'' said <PERSON> Coggin </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microbiology </ORGANIZATION> and Immunology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> medical school in Mobile. <PERSON> Coggin </PERSON> said he witnessed incidents in which employees' lunches were kept in a refrigerator along with AIDS-infected blood samples, a surgical assistant used a hallway telephone while wearing blood-soaked gloves and janitors removed biohazardous waste in unprotected street clothes. `` Most of these workers recognize the potential danger and even lethal outcomes of a laboratory exposure to blood-borne viruses and agents but yield to the pressure of getting the work done quickly,'' <PERSON> Coggin </PERSON> said. Most health workers, <PERSON> Coggin </PERSON> said, appear to be unaware of voluntary guidelines that the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has suggested for handling contaminated blood. He said that without the required actions, workers in laboratories, hospitals and research centers `` will continue to have infectious disease transmitted needlessly through blood and human materials in the workplace.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> has reported 18 cases of infection with HIV, the virus that can cause AIDS, as a result of workplace exposure, and an estimated 12,000 health-care workers now contract hepatitis B every year because of occupational exposure. According to the newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> has proposed requiring: _ Gloves, face shields, gowns, fluid-resistant clothing and other equipment for any workers who might be exposed to potentially infectious materials _ Employer-paid vaccinations of all employees whose jobs exposed them to hepatitis B, as well as follow-up examinations and blood tests after exposure incidents _ Safety features such as double doors, easily washed surfaces, areas for decontamination and sinks for washing in work areas where hepatitis B or the AIDS virus is produced for research purposes Any rules formulated by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Stocks Down In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar, after a six-day decline, rose sharply against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today despite intervention by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank, while stock prices fell. The dollar closed at 140.65 yen, up 1.35 yen from Monday's close of 139.30 yen. It opened at 139.72 yen and ranged between 139.70 and 140.68 yen. The dollar had fallen 5.70 yen in six trading days before today's rebound. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the 225-share <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> lost 256.60 points, or 0.72 percent, closing at 35,366.37 points. Currency traders said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> intervened several times in the morning, selling dollars at about the 140-yen level, but did not act in the afternoon, and the dollar rose quickly in the last half-hour of trading. It was not immediately known how much the central bank sold. The bank normally does not comment on its exchange market activities. `` There was no real reason to buy dollars, but the market still seemed to be short of the currency. It looks like the market will continue to support the dollar,'' said <PERSON> Minori </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Many players were sitting on the sidelines, awaiting the results of a meeting of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank on Thursday, she said. There have been rumors that the bank will raise interest rates. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> investors were focusing on selling West German marks and buying yen, thus helping the dollar to strengthen against other major currencies, said a Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trader on condition of anonymity. On the stock exchange, `` The rebound of the dollar did n't do much to help the sentiment of the market,'' said a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said many investors were sitting on the sidelines watching the currency markets. `` Many people seemed content to lock in the short-term gains of the past few days,'' he said, referring to sales for profit-taking. Stocks that were strong last week, including securities, insurance, railway and retailer sales issues, fell back. Shares in some smaller companies and warehousing firms rose strongly. `` It was n't all doom and gloom. It was mostly the big stocks that were being hit'' in the market's decline, the trader said.

<HEAD>Black Tar Heroin Leads to Overdoses, Deaths</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A rash of overdoses and deaths attributed to particularly potent chips of `` black tar'' heroin has addicts and occasional users alike terrified and frantically seeking treatment, officials said. From Friday through Monday, three people died and dozens of others were treated after they literally were knocked off their feet and rendered unconscious after injecting themselves with the most-popular form of heroin in the drug world. `` It's the talk of the neighborhood,'' said <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>, director of the Facts on Crack program at Glide Memorial Church in the <LOCATION> Tenderloin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, where most of the overdoses occurred. `` What we're here for now is prevention and support while this epidemic is going on,'' <PERSON> Franks </PERSON> said, adding that a 24-hour crisis telephone line has been set up and will operate as long as necessary. Police Inspector <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> said a dealer probably forgot to mix the heroin with other materials to dilute its strength, which normally is 6 percent to 9 percent pure. Tests showed the heroin had a 36 percent to 38 percent purity, said Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mollinari </PERSON>. Since overdose cases fell off sharply, he said, `` My guess is there's probably not much more out there.'' Black tar, named for its color and gooey appearance, has become the most commonly used heroin by <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s estimated 15,000 to 18,000 addicts since coming on the scene about seven years ago, said Dr. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalcup </PERSON>, medical director of the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic. It sells for about $ 20 a bag that can be broken into several shots. The clinic generally treats about 120 people daily and turns away about 10 or 15. Within a couple of hours Monday, it had turned away almost 40, he said. `` The people who buy street heroin are literally playing with their lives,'' he said. The fatalities were said to be men ages 35, 41 and 43. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coroner </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> did not release names. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents seized 2 kilos of black tar heroin at hotels near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A geyser-like volcano blasting nitrogen ice and gas five miles high was photographed on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s moon <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> 2 in the craft's last hurrah of its grand solar-system tour. The discovery, announced Monday as <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> 2 formally ended its two-month encounter with <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, proves <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> is the solar system's third known object with active eruptions, scientists said. The others are Earth and <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io, which has sulfur-spewing volcanoes and geysers. Photographs radioed to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> flew past <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> in August showed dark, plume-shaped deposits of material lying on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s south polar ice cap. At the time, scientists believed the deposits were created by volcanoes spewing gas and ice 12 to 20 miles skyward. They said they believed the volcanoes were active or had been active during the past few centuries. But it was n't until late last week that closer examination of pictures taken from 62,000 miles revealed an eruption in progress, said <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Miner </PERSON>, deputy Voyager project scientist at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. `` We caught one in the act!'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> news release called such eruptions `` geyser-like phenomena.'' But Voyager's project scientist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said, `` From the standpoint of a major eruption, one would clearly discuss it as a volcano.'' He said a column of dark material rising five miles from the surface can bee seen. On Earth, volcanoes erupt material that makes up the planet's crust _ molten rock _ while geysers spew water `` It's a semantic issue,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, head of Voyager's photographic imaging team. The eruption is n't apparent in any single image of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, but was recognized by examining several images taken from different angles and analyzed through stereoscopic techniques, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said, calling the discovery `` Voyager's last hurrah in its journey past the planets.'' Voyager 2's encounter with the solar system's fourth-largest planet formally started Aug. 5 and ended Monday, when the one-ton probe was 34.7 million miles past <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, traveling at 37,337 mph. The spacecraft was 2.83 billion miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, and traveled a curved 4.46-billion-mile path since its launch in 1977. Voyager 2 explored Jupiter in 1979, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Although <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> will continue to look back at <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> until December, Monday's formal end of the encounter was marked by the activation of new computer commands replacing the program that guided the craft and its cameras and instruments through the close examination of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. Voyager 2, like its twin <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> 1, is expected to return information to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> for 25 or 30 more years before its plutonium power generators fail. The probes will measure magnetic fields and electrically charged particles in space as they search for the edge of the solar system. Voyager 1 explored Jupiter in 1979 and <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1980. Scientists do n't know what causes the eruptions on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, which is about four-fifths the size of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s moon and is the coldest known object in the solar system, with a surface temperature of 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said one possibility is that heat from sunlight penetrates and is trapped below <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s polar ice, evaporating nitrogen ice into gas that powers the eruptions. The active volcano is the third and apparently the only active type of volcanism discovered on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s efforts to prevent oil and gas exploration in the rich fishing grounds of <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> focused on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> declined to hear the state's latest appeal The court Monday left intact rulings that allowed the federal government to sell $ 94 million worth of exploratory leases last year on 5.6 million acres of the bay off southwest <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` It means, as we suspected, that the battle has shifted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which is moving in the direction of protecting <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> from development,'' said <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, executive director of the environmental group Trustees for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. State Attorney General <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Baily </PERSON> said he was not surprised by the court's action: `` We've been focusing on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in part, because we did n't want to trust all of our eggs in the basket of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' State officials, environmental groups and fishing organizations have said the relatively small chance of finding large amounts of oil under <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> is not worth the risk of an oil spill to fish and wildlife. They also contend that a spill would do more environmental harm there than the Exxon Valdez spill did to Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The March 24 tanker disaster, the nation's worst oil spill, forced the closure of several fishing areas. <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> supports the world's largest red salmon fishery, worth more than $ 1 billion annually, and the largest herring fishery in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters. It also is home to a majority of the world's northern fur seals, the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gray </LOCATION> whale population, and millions of seabirds, geese and ducks. `` <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> is the only place we've opposed oil development, and for one chief reason _ the risk to the fishery is n't worth the potential oil spill,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>. `` The court's action is disappointing, but should n't be a surprise to anyone.'' An agreement in a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> last week would prohibit any drilling in the bay for a year, and require the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to consider buying back the leases. Under the plan, any buy-back recommendation would be tied to the results of an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study of the effects of the Exxon Valdez spill. That study also would look at the adequacy of spill-contingency plans for <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> development. Only <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could authorize the repurchases. The agreement is contained in the department's fiscal 1990 spending bill, which was expected to return to the House today and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by Wednesday for final approval, said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, press secretary for Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>. The studies and Interior's recommendation are due by March 1991, meaning no exploration is likely in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> before then. Sue <LOCATION> Flensburg </LOCATION>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bristol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dillingham </LOCATION>, said the congressional moratorium and eventual repurchase of the leases represent the last chances to protect the bay. `` At this point I'm pretty confident that it will make it through the appropriations bill, and that's about the best we can hope for at this point,'' she said. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said the congressional effort is more significant in light of Monday's court action. `` <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> is one of the world's most productive fisheries and home to seven species of endangered mammals,'' he said. `` It's one of the last places in this country that should be developed for oil.

<HEAD>Orders 6-Month Freeze on Auto Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s insurance commissioner put an immediate six-month freeze on auto insurance rates and said she would set the size of voter-mandated rate rollbacks by the end of the year. Commissioner <PERSON> Roxani </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said Monday she ordered the freeze partly in response to an announcement last week by <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> that it would raise auto rates by 5.9 percent Nov. 1. That would be one week before Proposition 103 gives the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> authority </ORGANIZATION> to veto rate increases. Some other insurance companies indicated they had similar plans, she said. `` The rate freeze I am imposing will protect consumers and clamp a lid on any insurance company attempting to raise rates,'' she said. <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> also said she would set industry-wide standards for the rate rollback required by the proposition, and for future rate approvals by her department, at hearings scheduled to start Oct. 30. She said the standards would apply to every insurance company in the state. A court challenge to the freeze is `` a good possibility,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, spokesman for Farmers and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>, which have formed the <ORGANIZATION> Personal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The moves were applauded by consumer groups that had accused <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> of trying to undermine the initiative, which was approved by voters last November. `` We're on the road to a solution,'' said <PERSON> Nettie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoge </PERSON> of Consumers Union. In August, <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said she would consider individually every insurance company's request for an exemption from the proposition's requirement of a 20 percent rate rollback, in order to implement a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling guaranteeing insurers a `` fair rate of return. She also made statements widely interpreted as exempting 184 insurers from even being considered from a rollback _ companies whose profit levels for auto, property and liability insurance were below 11.2 percent. That represented a 15-year industry average, <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> told reporters Monday those firms `` were never exempted.'' Fountain said Farmers needed a rate increase because it was suffering losses under a program in which insurers are randomly assigned policies of high-risk drivers under rates set by the state. But <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said her department would address the assigned-risk problem in a hearing Friday on a rquest for a 112 percent rate increase for the program.

<HEAD>Government-Opposition Talks Over Rent Boycott Called Breakthrough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government officials have for the first time negotiated with leading anti-apartheid leaders about ending the 3-year-old rent boycott in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the country's largest black township. Business Day, a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> daily, today described the talks as the highest-level bargaining session ever held between the white-controlled government and major anti-apartheid activisits. It quoted one unidentified activist as calling Monday's parley, in which the government offered to waive some unpaid rent, `` an unprecedented breakthrough'' because the activists were accepted as primary negotiating partners. The boycott has been one of the most effective protests by blacks since a national state of emergency was declared in June 1986. <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, home to an estimated 2.5 million blacks on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, has been the hardest-hit of several townships affected by rent boycotts. It has lost more than $ 100 million in revenue. The government delegation, led by <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> Danie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hough </PERSON>, met in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> city councilors and prominent activists, including Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>; the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, co-president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> anti-apartheid coalition. <PERSON> Hough </PERSON> said the activists `` have a very important role to play'' _ an unusual government acknowledgement of the influence enjoyed by militant leaders within black communities. He said the delegations would meet again. The government could not accept demands to write off all unpaid rent, but a partial waiver could be negotiated, <PERSON> Hough </PERSON> said. He offered to negotiate ways to transfer ownership of rented houses to their occupants, another demand of the activists. <PERSON> Hough </PERSON> said a demand that <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> be unified to share tax revenue was `` probably impractical.'' <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, the activists' spokesman, said the meeting showed that `` we can resolve problems by talking rather than relegating the solution to the police.'' Police have tried periodically to evict boycotters from their homes. One such campaign, in August 1986, led to confrontations in which more than 20 blacks were killed by police gunfire. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s archivist says he would `` give anything for a ticket from Opening Night'' in 1891 to add to the souvenirs being collected for the hall's 100th anniversary. <PERSON> Gino </PERSON> <PERSON> Francesconi </PERSON> says he knows an original ticket is out there somewhere. `` I was told by a collector that he had seen it five or six years ago,'' he said Monday. Photos from pre-1920 and posters from before 1960 still are needed, <PERSON> Francesconi </PERSON> said. `` Most of those are just hanging on people's walls. I ca n't believe that there are n't posters of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>, <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Toscanini </PERSON> out there,'' <PERSON> Francesconi </PERSON> said The call for historic items already has turned up other goodies, including the silver trowel used by <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>, to lay the cornerstone in 1890 and a ribbon that was cut on opening night in 1891. <PERSON> Bennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelson </PERSON>, donated one of her late father's clarinets, and lots of photographs and recordings have surfaced. The items will be shown in special exhibitions in 1990 and 1991, and some eventually will be displayed in a Carnegie Hall museum. <PERSON> Francesconi </PERSON> has most of the house programs, but is missing those from 1892-98, 1928-37 and 1944-47. `` There are things out there that people assume we have,'' he said. `` Maybe once upon a time we did, but when the hall was threatened with demolition in the late 1950s, we know stuff disappeared. They wanted to take souvenirs before <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was gone for good.'' <PERSON> Francesconi </PERSON> is also hoping to turn up correspondence relating to the hall. `` People have responded from all over the country, it's just been fantastic,'' he said. `` But we're fighting the clock now _ we've given ourselves until March to look for material.''

 Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> has agreed to pay $ 11,700 a year and create a $ 150,000 education trust for a 6-year-old boy to settle a paternity suit, a judge announced. The out-of-court settlement was called generous by lawyers for both sides and resolves the matter five weeks before <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s mayoral election, in which <PERSON> Young </PERSON> is seeking a fifth term Under terms of the settlement, announced Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Chief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> will pay $ 225 a week _ $ 11,700 annually _ to <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Loving </PERSON> until he turns 19. He also will set aside enough money to create a $ 150,000 trust for the boy's education `` We feel that it's a rather good settlement for <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Loving </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON>, lawyer for the boy's mother, <PERSON> Annivory </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON>. `` We have virtually established his welfare through age 18 and certainly given him a nice little stipend to start his life.'' <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON>, 34, a former <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> city official who is now director of public works for the city of <LOCATION> Fontana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, sued Young in January. In May, laboratory tests proved the four-term, 71-year-old mayor was the boy's father. `` From this point on, I'll be able to get on with the rest of my life,'' <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Charfoos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s lawyer, also said the settlement was generous. The mayor `` has done as fine a job of taking care of his son as any son can ask of a father,'' he said. The trust will pay $ 10,000 installments each year from the boy's 19th through 24th birthday When he turns 25, the trust will terminate and he will receive the remaining $ 90,000. The payments require the boy, who turns 7 on Oct. 18, him to pursue a post-secondary education, <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said. `` We hope beyond -LRB- the money -RRB- <PERSON> Young </PERSON> will establish a father relationship,'' <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Charfoos </PERSON> said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s relationship with his son is `` obviously a significant concern'' but would n't discuss what Young plans to do. The settlement means <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s income tax returns will remain private, along with the amount of money in his campaign coffers, estimated to be about $ 5 million before the primary. The mayor is running for a fifth, four-year term against <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON>, an accountant whom <PERSON> Young </PERSON> defeated soundly four years ago.

 The government freed opposition leader <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and eight of his colleagues after questioning them about their campaign to slash government revenues during a 20-hour detention. But all nine face charges including `` crimes against the state, crimes against the administration of justice and crimes against the national economy,'' Attorney General <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalaz </PERSON> said. The most serious of the accusations carries a 15 to 20 year prison sentence, according to the penal code. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, a vice presidential candidate in May elections, was arrested Sunday in <LOCATION> Veraguas </LOCATION> province, 180 miles west of the capital. He and the the others had been promoting the anti-government campaign they call `` not one penny more''. Authorities called it `` economic insurrection,'' and questioned him for four hours before he was freed on Monday, he said. The opposition is urging Panamanians to delay paying taxes and utility bills and to boycott the state-controlled lottery and gambling casinos. The campaign aims to withold essential funds from the government run by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has already been badly hurt by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions. Former presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> is in the 14th day of a hunger strike aimed at encouraging Panamanians to join the campaign. `` When the regime reacts in such an exaggerated way to a non-violent campaign, it is revealing the impact of the campaign, the weakness of the regime and its bad conscience,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Divisa </LOCATION>, 150 miles west of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He said the group was arrested Sunday by about 20 people carrying AK-47 assault rifles and revolvers. `` Physically, there was no mistreatment, but there was psychological mistreatment,'' he said. A statement by <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said the opposition `` reiterates its promise to keep fighting for the establishment of a democratic system of government and full respect for human rights by the peaceful means we have been following, despite the escalation of violations and attacks from the dictatorial regime.'' <PERSON> Villalaz </PERSON> said four other opposition activists were detained Sunday in <LOCATION> Chiriqui </LOCATION> province, 240 miles west of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> said they remained jailed. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> was one of two opposition vice presidential candidates in May 7 national elections the government annulled after returns showed the opposition winning by a landslide.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Calls for Economic ``New Deal'' for Third World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Borrowing rhetoric from <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION>, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said a new worldwide Great Depression is looming and called for a `` New Deal'' for Third World debtor nations. `` Right before our eyes the world is sliding into a deep economic depression,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said in a speech Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The debt of the Third World countries, the interest they have to pay and the pace of their economic development _ are these not the signs of an impending catastrophe?'' he asked. Developing nations have a $ 1.3 trillion foreign debt, mostly to banks in the industrialized Western nations. Many Third World nations are unable to pay even the interest on their debt, and their economies are stagnating as their scarce funds are used to repay debt rather than build their economies. `` Radical new steps are needed, a kind of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deal </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, speaking in Russian with the help of a translator. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and his country should share advanced technology with the developing world, and said `` some debt'' should be forgiven, a concept already being advanced by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> holds almost none of the developing world's debt <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> compared the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s current social upheaval and economic travail with the Great Depression in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, when radical sentiment grew and many Soviet Communists predicted the imminent downfall of capitalism. `` In 1929, a powerful and confident state took an economic nosedive. There were bread lines in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Times Square and tents of the jobless huddled along <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, troops were fighting the Bonus Army that had invaded the capital. People were dying in demonstrations, strikes and riots,'' said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, adding that the same is happening in his country today. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s `` economic system is undergoing an adjustment,'' he said. `` Something similar happened in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 60 years ago.'' But he added, `` so long as there is the will, the understanding of the situation and the determination to change things for the better _ and we certainly have them _ the economy can remedy its ills.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> predicted that nations would one day compete `` not for political supremacy or spheres of influence but for access to water, fresh air and even a green lawn. Such conflicts could be caused by demographic problems, hunger and poverty among part of the world's population, or by epidemics of infectious disease.'' During a question-and-answer session, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> declined to say whether the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is likely to renew diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> any time soon. He also ducked a question on Soviet policy toward the flow of refugees from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, saying `` those two countries will be able to sort out that problem.''

 A woman has the right to retain two homes used in drug sales if she can prove she opposed her husband's deals, a federal appeals court ruled Monday's ruling by a three-judge panel of the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> sets a precedent in protecting the privacy of a married couple, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Garhart </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> DiLoreto </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> ordered the property forfeited after determining Mrs. <PERSON> DiLoreto </PERSON> knew her husband was selling drugs from the houses. But the appeals court said <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> should have allowed Mrs. <PERSON> DiLoreto </PERSON> to argue she opposed her husband's use of the homes. The court also said <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> improperly considered hearsay evidence in making his decision. <PERSON> Garhart </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> DiLoreto </PERSON>, the mother of four, faced a dilemma: either break up the family or continue living with her husband in their Erie homed despite his drug dealing. `` The government would have us carve so deeply into the marital relationship for so little gain in the war on drugs,'' he said. <PERSON> Garhart </PERSON> said the appeals court seemed to be `` trying to make the statute comport to the real world.'' The 3rd Circuit placed the burden of proof on Mrs. <PERSON> DiLoreto </PERSON> and gave the district court leeway to decide whether she will need any evidence beyond her denials to support her defense. <PERSON> DiLoreto </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, 32, was convicted Aug. 10, 1988, of conspiracy to sell $ 1 million worth of cocaine and marijuana, two counts of using a telephone in the conspiracy and failing to report income from cocaine sales. Last month, he was sentenced to five years in prison without parole. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowden </PERSON> would not comment on the decision.

 A judge sentenced <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace activist <PERSON> Abie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> today to six months in prison for violating an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law by meeting with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to the charge last week, said he would fight to overturn the law `` even from my prison cell.'' He received a one-year suspended sentence in addition to the jail term. The 63-year-old <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> operates the pirate radio station `` Voice of Peace'' from a ship in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. Dressed in black pants and a black shirt, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> stood silent as <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fass </PERSON>, deputy president of the <ORGANIZATION> Ramle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrate </ORGANIZATION>'s Court, read the sentence. He told reporters later that his jailing would not halt his efforts for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace. `` If somebody thinks I'm going to stop ... they're in for big surprises,'' he said. `` I hope that public opinion and the people in the streets will understand that this law is an obstacle to peace. `` I will continue even from my prison cell to protest against this law ... and immediately after prison I shall continue to speak to the enemy,'' he said. The sentencing came as arguments raged in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s coalition <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> over whether to agree to <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s call for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to hold peace talks with Palestinians approved by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it calls a terrorist organization. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc opposes meeting a PLO-approved delegation, but the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> accepts the plan. The meetings would be a first step toward resolving the 21-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. AT least 575 Arabs and 40 Israelis have died in the revolt. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> pleaded guilty Wednesday to meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> activists in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in September 1988. He told the court he knew he was violating a 1986 amendment to the anti-terror law that prohibits holding meetings with terrorist organizations. The court ruled that <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> could start his sentence after the Yom Kippur Jewish holiday on Monday. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> faced a three-year sentence but the few people convicted as violators have had sentences commuted to public service. The judgment said <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> had more responsibility as a public figure. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Pinhas </PERSON> <PERSON> Marinsky </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> would not appeal the sentence. The court judgment said of <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, `` No matter the good of his intentions or his motives, it can not release him of his criminal responsibility ... In a <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, it's inconceivable to take the law into your own hands.'' <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> is best known for his dramatic trip to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> in 1964 to try to persuade <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to make peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In 1978, he went on a 45-day hunger strike to protest building Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. The Indian-born <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> first met <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in 1982 when he traveled to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> during the Israeli siege of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in an unsuccessful attempt to gain freedom for a captured <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier.

 The governor of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> denied promising a government contract to officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a meeting arranged by Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, who is on trial for allegedly selling political favors to the company. Gov. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez-Colon </PERSON> was called by the prosecution Monday to testify in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> about a September 1985 meeting with <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials at the governor's mansion in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>.

He testified that the governor promised to `` take care'' of the contract and do whatever he could to help <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hernandez-Colon </PERSON> confirmed the meeting took place but denied he made any promises to the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials there, <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON>. `` In no way did I say I was going to give you this contract,'' he testified. `` That was beyond my authority.'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a 56-year-old <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> congressman, and his 48-year-old wife are charged with conspiring to do favors for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for $ 185,000 in checks and interest-free loans and a diamond and emerald necklace. One of the favors they are accused of performing was arranging the meeting with <PERSON> Hernandez-Colon </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials sought the meeting because they wanted to win a contract to build ferry boats for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory. The governor testified that he may have suggested to officials considering the ferry contract to consider <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s offer to build a shipyard in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and offer jobs to Puerto Ricans if the company won the contract. Unemployment in the territory then was 21.8 percent. Under cross-examination, <PERSON> Hernandez-Colon </PERSON> said he did n't believe anything improper took place at the meeting. A prosecutor, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirshman </PERSON>, asked <PERSON> Hernandez-Colon </PERSON> whether he would think differently if he knew that one month earlier, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> had asked <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> for a $ 20,000 loan that would be issued to his sister but was actually for the <ORGANIZATION> Garcias </ORGANIZATION>. `` If I were in fact certain of that as a fact, my opinion would be changed,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Garcias </ORGANIZATION> have pleaded innocent to charges of extortion, conspiracy, bribery and receipt of illegal gratuities. If convicted of the most serious charge, extortion, they face up to 20 years in prison.

A senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described the talks as `` relaxed, candid, generally non-polemical, informative.'' The goal of the talks, the official said, were to `` improve understanding between the two sides,'' as well as `` enhance stability and predictability.'' The main topics of discussion were `` how national security and defense decisions are made in the two countries,'' as well as military strategies, defense spending, regional conflicts and arms control negotiations, the official said. Specifically, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials sought information about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s promise to make unilateral troop reductions and to cut the defense budget by 14 percent. `` The Soviets gave us some details. ...

 A man on trial on charges of planting 13 bombs around buildings and bridges was motivated by a rivalry with a legislator who long ago beat him out for roles in high school plays, a prosecutor said. `` This is a drama that started a number of years ago,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said during opening arguments Monday. `` It started in the mind of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, a non-conformist who did n't believe in authority.'' <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, 31, is charged with making and planting the bombs found in 1988 in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, a community of 6,000. None of the bombs exploded, but three ignited and fizzled. No one was injured. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> could be sentenced to 285 years in prison if convicted of conspiracy, illegal possession of dynamite, 14 counts of making bombs and 13 of attempting to destroy buildings and bridges used in interstate commerce. `` This was a cowardly, terroristic act that held the city hostage,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` It still holds the city hostage.'' Defense attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> contended the government's case was based largely on circumstantial evidence and `` exaggeration, drama, theatrics and no substance.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the government would introduce tape recordings in which <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> boasted there were only two people in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> smart enough to manufacture the bombs _ he and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, 42, who worked with <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> at a factory. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> was convicted Sept. 5 on the same counts <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> is charged with and was expected to testify for the government in <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>'s trial. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the largest of the 13 bombs, containing 54 sticks of dynamite, was found behind the law office of state Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The prosecutor said <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> had a rivalry with <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> that dated to their high school days, when they competed for theater roles. `` He was traditionally beat out in almost every instance by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The feelings built up in <LOCATION> Hubbard </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. The prosecutor said <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> regularly wore camouflage. `` He calls himself a survivalist. He calls himself antagonistic. He calls himself a radical, and that's what he is,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> told jurors they would have to decide whether the devices found around <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> were `` in fact bombs or were they something designed to scare.'' <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> said his client has `` a boatload of emotional problems and substantial alcohol problems. When he's drinking, he brags, he lies, and he exaggerates.''

 Five amateur astronomers are preparing for an undreamed-of opportunity to go eyeball to eyeball with the universe using what will be the world's most powerful space telescope. In a gesture of appreciation for scientific contributions by hobbyists using backyard telescopes, the <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telescope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> has offered 20 hours of observing time on the <ORGANIZATION> Hubble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telescope </ORGANIZATION> to projects designed by amateurs. The telescope, to be launched on a space shuttle in March, is a joint project of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The project, based at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to cost about $ 750 million and has been in planning stages for a decade. For someone who is not a professional astronomer, the odds of getting to use the telescope are comparable to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jetson </PERSON>'s chances of getting a raise from his tightfisted boss at Spacely Sprockets `` I would guess every amateur astronomer would love to use it,'' said one of those selected, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Secosky </PERSON>, a science teacher from <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` I never thought I'd get to use an instrument like this.'' But astronomy is one of the few scientific fields in which amateurs make significant breakthroughs. For example, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubble </PERSON>, the American astronomer for whom the telescope is named, developed his theory of the expanding universe in cooperation with <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Humason </PERSON>, a former janitor, mule driver and high-school dropout. `` In actuality, outer space begins in your back yard. All you need is a good pair of binoculars to get started,'' said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Kandefer </PERSON>, an electrical engineer from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, who also was chosen. Others selected include a computer expert and a homemaker. Professionals already have overbooked time on the telescope, the first major optical telescope that will be permanently stationed in low Earth orbit, said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Villard </PERSON>, an institute spokesman. The 24,000-pound instrument, about the size of a bus, has a 2.4-meter mirror that will gather enough light to enable researchers to make images of things that are 25 to 50 times fainter than the dimmest object previously seen. Free of the atmosphere's distortion of distant light and the Earth's tendency to absorb the extreme ends of the light spectrum, the telescope will produce pictures 10 times clearer than anything available on the ground, <PERSON> Villard </PERSON> said. `` If your eyes were as good as the telescope, you would be able to see a dime 20 miles away _ and know it was a dime,'' <PERSON> Villard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Secosky </PERSON>, 42, is interested in why <PERSON> Jupter </PERSON>'s moon Io sometimes appears brighter as it emerges from the planet's frigid shadow. He thinks his observations may detect evidence of frost forming on the moon. <PERSON> Kandefer </PERSON>'s regular job is working on flight controls and guidance sensors, but the 42-year-old engineer spends his free time trying to learn about steller magnetic fields 10 times stronger than the sun's. The only woman in the group, <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, was half a dozen years into an accounting career when she decided to take time off to raise her two children and fell in love with astronomy through <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> correspondence courses. Her goal is to find huge planets taking form around stars, a process scientists suspect is occurring but can not prove because it is so difficult to distinguish any object that close to a star's brightness <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> hopes to find planets five to 10 times larger than Jupiter that release enormous amounts of energy, detectable to a telescope as heat. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterner </PERSON>, a 37-year-old computer scientist at <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION>, will test his theory that luminescent arcs discovered in a distant galaxy cluster are made of stars. Most astronomers consider such arcs to be optical illusions caused by gravity bending starlight. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, who works at a science museum in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, hopes to detect a hypothetical mass of primordial material surrounding a star where comets could take form. `` We are n't professional scientists and we would not qualify as observers under the regular procedures,'' <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> said. `` This is an incredible opportunity for an amateur astronomer on what is esentially the most capable astronomical instrument ever created.''

<HEAD>Lebanese Deputies Seek Balanced Power-Sharing Formula to End War</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Lebanese legislators today debated changing the way their government is structured to provide greater power sharing between warring Moslems and Christians. The members of the Lebanese parliament are considering `` balancing and overlapping powers'' of a Christian president, a Sunni Moslem premier and a Shiite Moslem parliament speaker, conference sources said. Conflicts among these Lebanese factions have been feeding the civil war that broke out in April 1975 and has ravaged the nation, claiming the lives of an estimated 150,000 people. Most recently, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> in March sparked six months of lethal shelling when he declared a `` war of liberation'' against the 40,000 Syrian troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, accusing them of siding with the Moslems. A Arab mediating team made up of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, acting on mandate of the 22-member <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, arranged a cease-fire Sept. 22 that generally has been holding. Sixty-three of the 73 surviving members of the parliament have been meeting in this <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> mountain resort since Saturday to discuss a plan drafted by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> team for ending the sectarian strife. It calls for political reforms and later Syrian withdrawal. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Faisal </PERSON> steered the deputies away from Christian demands that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> withdraw before reforms are agreed, to concrentrate on the division of power in the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> government, long dominated by Maronite Christians. The conference sources said they expected the result to be essentially `` a mechanism of check, recheck and countercheck'' with a view to averting dictatorship or the supremacy of one religious faction over the others. But the debate indicated a continuing difference of views. Sources said several deputies rallied behind <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON> in advocating that the authority of the powerful president, a Maronite under the present unwritten national accord, be left unchanged. `` It would be hard on us to render our president a mere distributor of medals and decorations,'' <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON> was quoted as telling the session. But pro-Syrian Moslem deputy <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> told deputies `` we are not in the process of shifting powers from one religious faction to another, we are trying to curtail the powers of a dictatorial ruler and entrust them to a council of leadership -LRB- the cabinet of ministers -RRB-.'' A compromise called for continuing the presidential powers but abolishing the tradition of apportioning senior civil service slots along sectarian lines, now favoring Christians who dominate the military, judiciary and economy. The deputies met in closed session 10 miles away from the press center where reporters were restricted. One pro-Syrian deputy, <PERSON> Najah </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakim </PERSON>, unexpectedly showed up at the press center late Monday and said `` opinion gaps among the legislators on the powers of the president have been bridged, the general atmosphere of discussions is favorable, and we are hopeful.'' He refused to elaborate and left the press center abruptly. Sources said Oct. 21 has been tentatively fixed as the date for a formal session of parliament in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to ratify the new charter that would replace the unwritten accord of 1943. Two weeks later, the deputies would then meet to elect a new president to replace <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, whose term ran out last September. Parliament was unable to meet to elect a successor and rival administrations sprang up led by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and Moslem Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>.

The compromise also could reduce American pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to accept <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s peace efforts. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> met Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should not squander a `` golden opportunity'' for peace by rejecting his plan. In the occupied territories, meanwhile, troops today clashed with Palestinian stone-throwers, wounding four people, one seriously, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army said it was checking the reports. At least 123 Palestinians have been killed by fellow <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> as suspected collaborators during the 21-month uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. More than 580 others have died in clashes with soldiers and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians. Forty Israelis have been slain. The political feud in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> centers on objections by <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, headed by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, to U.S.-backed Egyptian proposals for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to negotiate with a team of Palestinians before holding elections in the occupied territories. Labor, headed by Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, supports the Egyptian idea, believing it the only way to break an impasse in the peace process. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> balks at <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s proposal to include two Palestinians deported by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the delegation. He feels this would be tantamount to opening the door to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> views as a terrorist group. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s top political aide, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON>, indicated in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday that the prime minister may be open to a compromise that would involve holding more exploratory talks on the question. Asked whether <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> would agree to a three-way meeting of American, Egyptian and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> representatives over the composition of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation, <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON> replied: `` Theoretically yes, because it sounds reasonable for such a tripartite meeting to hold a preliminary discussion over carrying out <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s political initiative.'' He stressed that any talks with Palestinians would require prior agreement by the Arabs to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s peace plan published last April, which calls for elections in the disputed lands pending negotiations for an interim settlement. He ruled out <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> involvement. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been pressuring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to accept the Egyptian proposals as a basis for continuing the stalemated peace process. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> he `` positively appraised'' an agreement by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> to promote the peace process and to support <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s peace plan. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has not yet issued an official position on <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s plan It objects to the fact that no mention is made of an independent Palestinian state.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders began meeting today to discuss ways to overhaul their image and win support of a citizenry that has embraced the new Solidarity-led government. The party, the first ever to lose control of a Soviet bloc government, is even considering changing its official name _ the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ as part of its effort to improve its standing with the populace. Opposition candidates virtually swept all seats available to non-Communist candidates in June's partially free elections. Pro-Solidarity lawmakers eventually put together a coalition with parties that were once allied with the Communists, resulting last month in the first non-Communist government in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. In 1993, elections are to be fully democratic, and the Communists are trying desperately to find a place in the new <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which is embracing democratic reforms in a scramble to salvage its collapsing economy. A survey released at the start of today's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenum showed that fully 72 percent of the party members favor changing its name to reflect a change in image and purpose. Party leaders were expected to set a date and an agenda for a party congress, which would enact the changes recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The congress would be a meeting of 1,000 to 2,000 delegates elected from among the 2 million rank-and-file party members. The congress is expected to be set for mid-February, said a party official, demanding anonymity. The party official said the internal party survey, in which more than half the members took part, showed there was a strong danger that the party could split. Party chief <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> has warned that a split could end the party. Accordingly, the plenum has adopted the slogan `` Unity at Any Price.'' The official described the split within party ranks as being between the leadership and the rank-and-file members, who favor radical reform, and the `` middle level'' party organizers who want to maintain a traditional party. The party official said the goal is to create a party that will be attractive to voters in the 1993 elections. The party hopes to do well enough in the voting to emerge as the dominant partner in a leftist coalition, he said. Party Secretary <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the party is inviting society to `` create the party with us,'' and that the party must strive to find an identity which will give it a popular base. `` The question is whether the Polish <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> can fulfill the aspirations of the part of Polish society which is left-leaning,'' he said. The plenum also is expected to support internal party democracy, a state-dominated economy for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and instigate a shakeup of the ruling Politburo. It would be the second leadership shuffle since July, the official said. `` If we remain in unity for three months, then we exist and we will win,'' the official said. `` If the party is destroyed, then the left does not exist for practical purposes for many years.'' The pro-Solidarity newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the draft resolution for the plenum called for development of a `` humanitarian, democratic and effective socialism.'' On the economic front, the draft favors a multi-sector economy dominated by the state-run economy. It opposes selling off state enterprises, a chief economic goal of the Solidarity-led government. The draft also `` obliges all party cells to create conditions for free expression of different views,'' the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Factory Orders Rebound in August</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods rebounded 2.9 percent in August after falling in July to their lowest level in eight months, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for both durable and non-durable manufacturered goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $ 237.2 billion following a 2.0 percent decline in July to the lowest level since last November. Orders rose 0.6 percent in June. The report was the latest in a string of indicators showing that the nation's economy continued to grow modestly last summer, despite earlier fears that efforts to control inflation could steer it into a recession. If the July weakness in manufacturing had persisted, it could have led to layoffs and a rise in the unemployment rate. Shipments of manufactured goods rose 5.6 percent, the sharpest increase in the current economic expansion that began in 1982. Shipments had fallen 2.3 percent in July, the sharpest fall since March 1986. Inventories, on the other hand, gained only 0.3 percent, the smallest increase in two years. Inventories posted a 1.2 percent gain in July, the biggest jump in five years. If inventories increase without a corresponding gain in new orders, it could signal production cutbacks in the future as factories attempt to get rid of goods on shelves and backlots. However, unfilled orders declined 0.3 percent, the first drop since a 0.1 percent fall in February 1987, indicating decreased demand for goods. Orders for durable goods, `` big-ticket'' items expected to last more than three years, rose 3.9 percent in August. That was a slight revision of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report last week that durable goods orders, boosted by robust automobile sales, had rebounded 3.8 percent for their steepest advance this year. Orders for non-durable goods advanced 1.8 percent. About half of the improvement in durable goods orders was attributed to the transportation sector, which rose 6.9 percent on the strength of auto sales despite a decline in aircraft sales. Non-electrical machinery, which includes computers, was up 9.3 percent. Orders of electrical machinery fell 2.1 percent and primary metals declined 1.8 percent. In the key category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of business investment plans, orders fell 10.1 percent in August after rising 5.9 in July.

<TEXT>
 One of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s abortion rights supporters is not taking part in a key abortion case before the court in its 1989-90 term. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> disqualified himself from the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case, one of three the high court is considering this term, for unstated reasons, court spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> had not disqualified himself when the justices agreed last July 3 to review the case. But a minor court order issued Monday in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case, which deals with abortion clinic regulations, noted that <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> did not participate. His absence will not change the outcome of the case if the justices line up as they did last July when voting 5-4 to let states make abortion harder to get. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was one of the dissenters. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> still is the key vote. If she votes against the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law, the outcome could be a 4-4 `` pro-choice'' victory. If she votes in favor of the law, the outcome could be a 5-3 anti-abortion victory. A 4-4 split would not set any legal precedent outside <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The case focuses on a state law that would require abortion clinics to add services and equipment now found only in hospitals. The law could force many clinics to close down, and could add up to $ 50 to the cost of an abrtion performed in the first three months of pregnancy. In invalidating the law, lower courts said it violated a portion of the 1973 ruling in <LOCATION> Roe </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> that limited state regulation over first-trimester abortions. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> officials are not asking the justices to use the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case to reverse <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, but legal experts say the court's ruling could chip away at the trimester-by-trimester approach taken in the 1973 decision. The two other abortion cases under high court study this term focus on parental notification requirements for unwed minors seeking to end their pregnancies in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> has not disqualified himself from those cases. The <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case is Turnock vs. <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON>, 88-790.

 Sales of new homes fell 0.4 percent in August, dropping back slightly from a huge double-digit gain in July, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that new single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 755,000 units in August, following a 16.1 percent gain in July, the largest increase in nearly three years. The July sales increase was the largest monthly advance since September 1986, when sales climbed by 22.9 percent. The revised July annual rate of 758,000 also was the highest level since December 1986, when new homes were sold at a rate of 784,000 units. Analysts had credited the July advance to a decline in fixed-rate mortgages which had fallen to 9.81 percent by the end of that month from a peak of 11.22 percent last March. But rates edged back up to 10.22 percent by the end of August, according to a monthly survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, contributing to the decline in home sales that month. The August decline was the third so far this year, but the first since last March although sales were unchanged in June. Sales for the first eight months were down 2.7 percent from the same period in 1988. The report on new home sales in August followed a report last Friday that sales of existing homes rose 3.3 percent that month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.44 million units. President <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Griben </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said the improvement in existing home sales reflected buyers taking advantage of declining interest rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report today said the median price of a new home was $ 122,900 in August, up 6.0 percent from $ 116,000 in July. The median is the point where half of the homes sold for more and half for less. The average price of a new home rose 14.6 percent to $ 162,300. New home sales in the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> declined 0.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 107,000 units. Sales had jumped 50 percent to 108,000 units in July. Sales in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> were down 27.9 percent to 93,000 units after rising 26.7 percent to 129,000 units a month earlier. Sales in the South rose 6.2 percent to 310,000 and were up 6.6 percent in the West to 244,000 units.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Reportedly Will Approve Extraditions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will vote to approve President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s decrees allowing extradition of top drug suspects to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and confiscation of their property, national television reported. The television program TV Hoy, quoting court sources, reported Monday night that a majority of 24 justices on the Court supported the decrees. The deadline for the court to rule was today, but normally several days pass before court rulings are made public. Seven bombs exploded in Colombian cities Monday night, two in the <LOCATION> Carribbean </LOCATION> coast city of <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION>, three in the port city of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marta </LOCATION> and two in the capital of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, national police said. Two people were injured in <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION> and two more in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marta </LOCATION>, the police said. They were part of a daily wave of bombings presumably set by drug traffickers. A <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling allowing extraditions would strengthen the Barco administration in its war against the drug lords, and would help allay fears that the court could undermine the anti-drug crackdown. TV <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> said, however, that the court would declare unconstitutional an additional decree allowing the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> army to raid drug traffickers' property at will. It said the court will support the government's right to confiscate property from drug traffickers but will require that it go through judicial channels. The court will not decide on the legality of property already seized, leaving that issue for lower courts, TV Hoy said. As of a week ago, the army had seized 1,056 homes, ranches, mansions office buildings and other property allegedly belonging to drug traffickers. The administration's main weapon in the drug war is its power to extradite suspected drug figures who have repeatedly shown their ability to escape justice in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a list of 80 Colombians it wants extradited to face drug charges, but it has disclosed the names of only the top 12. In 1984 the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, ruling on a technicality, declared extraditions to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> unconstitutional. The court has not dealt favorably with other important Barco decrees. Before Barco declared war on the traffickers Aug. 19, the court had knocked down seven decrees he issued in attempts to deal with both guerrillas and drug traffickers. The most important of earlier decrees declared unconstitutional was one creating a special tribunal within the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to deal with drug trafficking and other cases that present security problems for lower court judges. Barco wanted to remove certain cases from the jurisdiction of the lower court judges, who often have been threatened or killed while handling drug trafficking cases. In the last 10 years 220 court employees, including 41 judges, have been killed, many of them by drug traffickers.

 Cambodian guerrillas battled to take a government-held town in northwestern <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> today, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> and guerrilla sources said. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and two other guerrilla factions launched what they called a `` general offensive'' against the pro-Hanoi government on Saturday. They claimed to have overrun three towns and many other military positions. The guerrillas called it their biggest victory in about 11 years of guerrilla warfare. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which previously fought alongside Cambodian government forces after invading the country in 1978, says it withdrew its troops a week ago. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> claimed today that it held five Vietnamese soldiers in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chanthaburi </LOCATION> province who were captured in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> since the pledged pullout. However, the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> navy, which is responsible for the southern part of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> including <LOCATION> Chanthaburi </LOCATION>, said this was untrue. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Prachadavi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavetikul </PERSON> said he planned to show the Vietnamese to the press on Thursday, even though Capt. <PERSON> Buncherd </PERSON> <PERSON> Phunchoren </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said there had been no arrest or detention of any soldier since Sept. 20. In the Thai border town of <LOCATION> Aranyaprathet </LOCATION> heavy shelling and automatic weapons fire could be heard all day to the north and to the south across the border in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Western sources on the frontier following battlefield movements said the guerrillas were concentrating their forces on the town of <LOCATION> Kandoun </LOCATION>, inside <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> some nine miles from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. The guerrillas also were attempting to prevent the resupply of government positions, they said. No reliable reports of casualties have emerged either from the guerrillas or the government. Phnom Penh official media have not commented on the most recent fighting. <PERSON> Ieng </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouly </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> KPNLF </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said the offensive was a coordinated effort between the three guerrilla factions; his own, those loyal to exiled monarch Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and the radical communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians during its rule from 1975 until its forces were ousted by the Vietnamese in late 1978.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> today banned shellfish harvesting and warned against swimming in the ocean and rivers, saying Hurricane Hugo had left waters choked with sewage. Workers also resumed efforts today to reopen a bridge to the state's devastated resort islands, and officials ordered construction of an eight-mile-long sand dune to protect the beach from high tides later this month. As tons of supplies poured into the state, relief officials said they were awash in clothing and urged donors to instead send cash, food and building supplies. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, returned from a helicopter tour of the coast Monday sobered by the extent of the destruction. `` It's really incredible. There are areas that look like war zones,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who helped out Monday taking applications at a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> center in Moncks Corner. `` I think people understand that this has been devastating. I think we can see that in the nationwide outpouring of volunteers that the whole country understands.'' Hurricane Hugo slammed into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Sept. 21 with 135 mph winds, leaving at least 18 dead, 50,000 homeless, 270,000 jobless, and homes, businesses, schools and municipal buildings damaged or destroyed far inland and in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. In all, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> killed 29 people on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland. The warning against swimming could last for months and possibly affect the spring tourist season, said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. The indefinite ban on shellfishing was enacted because the 10 major sewage treatment plants in the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> area are not working fully and only 30 percent of the pollutants are being removed, Fanning said. When released into rivers, the waste depletes oxygen in the water, causing widespread fish kills. Rain that has hurt recovery efforts continued in some parts of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. In <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, a community that was in <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s path, a man and woman were killed Monday when their car was washed into a flooded creek. A search resumed today for a 17-year-old girl who was riding in the car. The nation's generosity toward storm victims has brought a backlog of donated clothing, including boxcar loads from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, said Maj. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. In the hard-hit fishing village of <LOCATION> McClellanville </LOCATION> about 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, the school is filled with donated clothes, said <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsome </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. `` Used clothing has almost choked us to death,'' he said, adding what's needed is donations of non-perishable food and building supplies. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> prepared to repair the <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sawyer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> _ the only link between the mainland and the devastated resorts of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and the Isle of Palms. The storm left the swing bridge hanging at a 45-degree angle with one end submerged in the water. Workers were to float barges under the dangling section and use the rising tide late today to help raise the bridge, said corps spokesman <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffennach </PERSON>. Then cranes will swing the bridge back into position. The bridge will be left in position for cars to traverse until experts determine whether they can repair the swing mechanism that opens the bridge to allow boats to pass on the Intracoastal Waterway. The Corps also announced that two contractors will pour sand on eight miles of beaches from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pawleys </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> later this week. The sand is meant to block further erosion of hurricane-damaged property during a surge of high tides expected in mid-October. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said 60 trucks carrying canned food, clothing and other necessities rolled into the city Monday. The mayor also said the city's dawn-to-dusk curfew, in effect since the storm, has been shortened to 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., but was still being enforced by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said about 90 percent of the city's hotels have reopened and many restaurants are back in business. Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, took to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor Monday and continued his criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which is coordinating the federal government's response to the disaster. `` <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> does not have but 10 centers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> 10 days after the disaster,'' he said. `` And, as far as I know, they still have n't given out a financial grant yet.'' Damage in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> alone has been estimated at $ 3 billion or more, with crop damage placed at $ 100 million.

<HEAD>AIDS Prompts Ban on Sperm Donations From Homosexuals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gay men and intravenous drug users have been barred from donating sperm in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state because of worries about AIDS. The regulations, which took effect this week, exclude any man from donating to a sperm bank if he has had homosexual activity, intravenous drug use or sex with a `` high risk'' person since 1977. The same people already are barred from donating blood in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state for the same reason, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardineer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> associate director for regulatory affairs. The regulations for the first time also require sperm banks to obtain state licenses. `` Women who choose to undergo artificial insemination should not be subjected to unnecessary risks for serious and even fatal illnesses,'' <PERSON> Gardineer </PERSON> said. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which chiefly afflicts homosexual men and intravenous drug users, is spread most often through sex; needles or syringes shared by drug abusers; infected blood, and from pregnant women to their offspring. <PERSON> Gardineer </PERSON> said there have been cases of infants who contracted AIDS because of donated sperm, but she could not say how many. The prohibition was recommended by several doctors' groups. The rules require extensive medical background checks on donors and tests on the donated sperm. All donations must be frozen for six months, the time it takes for someone infected with the AIDS virus to develop antibodies that show up in tests. The rules do n't apply in cases where a man is donating sperm for a specific woman, such as his wife, because donors have a right to privacy, officials said. The growing popularity of artificial insemination made the rules necessary, said <PERSON> Gardineer </PERSON>. In 1986, about 60,000 women gave birth as a result of artificial insemination in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. She estimated there are five sperm banks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, but said the number is n't certain because they have n't been licensed. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state has 25,000 confirmed AIDS cases, about a quarter of the nation's total. Most of them are in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> opened an official visit today and joined President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in promising expanded cooperation in combating cross-border drug smuggling. With <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> standing at his side during a White House welcoming ceremony, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> declared that the two countries, working together, `` can strike lethal blows against drug trafficking to free the world from that international scourge.'' In a similar vein, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> `` must continue to strengthen our assault on the plague of drug use and trafficking. For we know that what threatens one nation in our hemisphere threatens us all.'' The two presidents then presided over signing of two agreements, one to promote U.S.-Mexico trade, and the other to provide <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance for combating pollution in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said relations between the two countries have progressed since <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> took office last December, citing advances in such areas as debt, trade, investment and the environment. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, speaking through a translator, said ways must be found to deal more humanely with the migration of Mexicans to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He also said the two countries must work toward a `` new stage'' in their trade relations. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> is giving high priority to seeking trade concessions during his visit but a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, responding Monday to remarks <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> made to reporters before leaving <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, disagreed with his contention that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has difficulty penetrating American markets. After the welcoming ceremony and a meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> planned to attend a working lunch with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. A White House state dinner is scheduled for this evening. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has been highly complimentary of <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' performance during his first 10 months in office, praising his economic reform program and his efforts to crack down on drug-smuggling. But trade appears to be one area where the two sides are far apart. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> was reported to have complained during his meeting with reporters that it is inappropriate for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to criticize closed markets in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> itself is guilty of protectionist practices. `` I think that reciprocity in commercial relations is fundamental,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> was reported to have said. `` Is n't that what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is asking of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>?'' A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, insisting on anonymity, contended the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market is far more open than <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s. Whereas the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a huge trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> enjoys a $ 2.7 billion trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on total two-way trade of $ 43.9 billion, the official said. The official said that until recently <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was one of the most protectionist countries in the world. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has said he expects to press for preferential treatment for Mexican exports such as textiles, steel and agricultural products. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the administration has made no commitments to do what <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> wants, but that he will be given a hearing. The officials acknowledged that textiles and steel are highly sensitive areas for the administration because of protectionist pressures. As for agricultural products, they said that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> already supplies 60 percent of all the fruits and vegetables consumed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the winter months. The two sides are expected to sign seven agreements during <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' visit, symbolic of increased U.S.-Mexican cooperation since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> assumed their respective duties within a few weeks of each other. The agreements cover such issues as trade, investment, the environment, tourism and law enforcement, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. Officials from both sides seem relieved that the spirit of hostility that characterized cross-border relations during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has largely disappeared.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> may have begun at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> as a `` man of good deeds'' but soon became a `` world-class master'' of half truths to obtain power and wealth, a prosecutor said today at the evangelist's fraud trial. `` What has unfolded before you the last month is a tale of corruption _ immense corruption,'' prosecutor <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said during closing arguments. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> scribbled notes on a yellow legal pad and occasionally glanced at Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` There may have been a time when Mr. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was a man of good deeds back in the 1970s, but as time progressed into the 1980s, he began to use people to obtain possessions and power and keep it,'' she said. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s lawyer was to deliver his closing argument later in the day. Jury deliberations in the federal court trial were expected to begin as early as Wednesday. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> described <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> as a `` world-class master of using half truths. He lied to people, he used half truths to manipulate people. He used his position to maintain his power and wealth.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> completed his testimony Monday by accusing the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> of cheating <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> followers and by conceding he and his wife accepted millions in bonuses as the ministry's finances foundered. `` The real conspiracy to defraud came from that group of people who took over the ministry for their own selfish gains,'' said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who invited <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> to take over the ministry when he resigned in 1987 in a sex and money scandal. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> also denied the prosecutor's assertion that he failed to tell <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board members about the ministry's money problems. `` I do n't know how the board members could not be aware of the financial crisis at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>,'' he testified. `` They knew we had cash flow problems and they voted to borrow funds to pay for them.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, 49, is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy. He is accused of diverting more than $ 3.7 million in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money for his own benefit. If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $ 5 million. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to explain apparent contradictions between his story and testimony and exhibits presented by the government, including former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board members who said they did n't remember voting on some of the large bonuses for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Grutman </PERSON>, had intimidated the directors. `` <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Grutman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> threatened those board members that they would be in terrible danger,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> testified. Among the threats, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said, was that the directors might be liable to a civil suit. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, accepted $ 3.1 million in bonuses in the mid-1980s as the ministry's finances ran into trouble. He said the bonuses amounted to less than 1 percent of the more than $ 425 million he raised for the ministry. Asked by his lawyer what he did with the $ 425 million, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> replied, `` I put it to the work of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>.'' Board members granted the bonuses `` of their own free will,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said, and often told him he was `` worth much more than this, and they would say that over and over again.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who began his testimony Friday, spent 10 hours on the witness stand. He was the last defense witness. Under cross-examination on Friday, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> testified repeatedly that he did n't remember details of his ministry's finances. The testimony prompted his attorney, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, to say `` it was very damaging, very devastating.'' During defense questioning Monday, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> summed up his case: `` We were a church, and people always wanted to run it like a business. I had to keep telling them, this was a church, not a business.''

<TEXT>
 The captain of a Greek tanker that hit a reef and spilled 289,000 gallons of heating oil into <PERSON> Narragansett </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> testified today he did not have the required lookout on the bridge when entering the harbor. <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgoudis </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> also said maps made it unclear exactly where ships are to pick up their harbor pilots to guide the vessel into port. The vessel ran aground off <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> on June 23 before a pilot boarded. The captain of the World Prodigy told a board of inquiry convened by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that his company and Greek regulations required a lookout when entering a harbor. `` There was no one,'' however, because the lookout had been sent to help lower the ladder so the pilot could board, <PERSON> Georgoudis </PERSON> said through interpreters. He said he was doing nearly all the work on the bridge at the time of the accident, including lookout and navigator. `` I was everything,'' he said. <PERSON> Georgoudis </PERSON> had refused to testify previously before the panel, citing his right against self-incrimination. That no longer was an issue after he pleaded guilty in August and September to state and federal pollution charges. The captain was fined a total of $ 30,500.

<HEAD>Students At School Near Power Lines To Be Monitored For Radiation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge says he is going to order that students at an elementary school wear monitors to test for possible electromagnetic radiation from nearby high-voltage power lines. Two families who have children in <ORGANIZATION> Sandpiper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION> sued, contending that electromagnetic fields from a series of power lines within 135 feet of the school may be harmful to their children's health. <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Poulton </PERSON> said he will make his ruling after a school board meeting Wednesday. Parents and school officials want to have students wear a one-pound monitor. Six students will take turns wearing the $ 2,000 device on belts. Such monitors are usually worn by employees of utility companies. Sensors also will be installed in the ground outside the school and will be carried through the classrooms once a month to measure electromagnetic fields, created by even the smallest electrical current. The results of research into whether such radiation is harmful to humans have been contradictory. Some contend it can cause cancers, depression, miscarriages or other disorders. The congressional Office of Technology Assessment issued a report in June saying more research is needed to explore the potential health risks from electromagnetic fields produced by power lines, particularly the effects on the nervous system and possible role in promoting cancer. In November 1985, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> jury ordered <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 25.1 million to a suburban school district for building a high-power transmission line that attorneys claimed threatened the health of 4,000 students at three schools. <PERSON> Poulton </PERSON> ruled this past summer that there was insufficient evidence of potential harm to close the school as the parents had asked, but he did close much of the schoolyard during recess. In the action <PERSON> Poulton </PERSON> said he will order Wednesday, each volunteer will wear the monitor for a full school day once a month. Parents support the plan because the monitor measures a child's exposure to radiation as the student walks from room to room, as opposed to a stationary device gauging radiation in a set location <PERSON> Poulton </PERSON> said he will review measurements from the monitor and the other devices monthly. Parents <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rausch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenner </PERSON> sued the school board last year for locating <ORGANIZATION> Sandpiper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> near high-voltage power lines that can carry up to 230,000 volts. The Rausches believe electromagnetic fields from power lines near a school may have contributed to the death from brain-stem cancer in 1985 of their 8-year-old son <PERSON> William </PERSON>. At the time, they lived at <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. Educators want to include five other schools in the radiation monitoring plan to prove their theory that electric and magnetic fields at <LOCATION> Sandpiper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION> are no different than the radiation levels that exist on other campuses. The plan will cost the school board more than $ 51,000. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is among several states with electric field standards and the first to set a standard for magnetic fields. Strong opposition is building from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> homeowners, parents and environmentalists to proposed 500,000-volt lines in the west-central and southeastern parts of the state.

 Nine infants were hospitalized for severe intoxication in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> after mothers mistakenly gave them an alcohol-based antiseptic instead of stomach medicine sold in similar bottles, health officials said Tuesday.

 Two Dutch men were sentenced to five-year prison terms Tuesday for stealing three paintings by <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> and demanding a $ 2.2 million ransom for them, a court spokeswoman said. No ransom was paid for the works, and they were all recovered undamaged.

The thieves smashed a window of the museum and got away with the paintings before police arrived. In April, the thieves returned one of the works, `` The Loom'' from 1884, in an attempt to enforce their ransom demand. However, a planned ransom exchange fell through, and the two other paintings, the 1887 `` Wilted Sunflowers'' and an early version of the famous `` Potato Eaters'' painted in 1885, were recovered following the July arrests of four suspects. The two other men arrested are to be tried later this month, said court spokeswoman <PERSON> Lidwina </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanten </PERSON>.

 Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> today is unveiling a package of proposals aimed at reforming the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, including naming a chief financial officer and requiring public registration of lobbyists and consultants, sources familiar with the proposal said today. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s proposal also calls for the elimination of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grant funds that are awarded at the discretion of the secretary, and would impose new restrictions on Federal Housing Administration-backed mortgages for investment and vacation property, sources said. The elimination of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s discretionary grants, including on the $ 3 billion community development block grant program, would mean the awards would be based on competition. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> planned to announce his reform package at an afternoon news conference. Portions of his plans already have been discussed by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials, including his intention to create a new top-level, independent position of chief financial officer reporting to the secretary. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s appointee as assistant secretary for administration, <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last month that plans were being made for financial officer with broad powers _ a position that does not exist now in the scandal-plagued department. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has been hit by scandals over alleged mismanagement, fraud, influence peddling, and the steering of lucrative <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> subsidies to politically favored developers, consultants and lobbyists. Estimates of the cost range into the billions of dollars. Included in <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s package, the sources said, are a requirement that consultants and lobbyists who deal with the agency register and publicly disclose their dealings. A congressional source familiar with the <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> reforms said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> also will propose that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> kill its Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program, the multimillion dollar rent-subsidy program found to be riddled with influence peddling. It was an April audit of that program that set off the current investigations of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. The auditors found that subsidies appeared to have been steered to former agency officials and developers who hired prominent <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultants to lobby <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. Also in the package, a source said, is a proposal providing that 1.5 percent of money in each <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> program would be allocated to evaluation of how that program is working _ a move aimed at making sure <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials are aware of program abuses. Other features would require public dislosure by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> when it is waiving any regulations, and restrictions on the obtaining of double subsidies by some developers, such as renovation subsidies and tax credits. On <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION>, the sources said, the secretary was proposing a prohibition on FHA-backed loans for investment property and second homes used as vacatation homes. It will impose tougher capital requirements for companies who underwrite a portion of <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> loans under the multi-family coinsurance program, the sources said. Dealings by politically connected lobbyists and consultants was the subject of a hearing Monday by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee that has been investigating the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandals. The chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., charged that a `` greased, sweetheart deal'' brought $ 31 million in federal housing subsidies to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> renovation project, but the apartments are still like slums <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said `` infinitely more worthy projects'' were denied funds when <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> made the grant to the housing project in which <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> lobbyist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> is a partner. But <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> testified at a hearing Monday that his lobbying company `` has worked within the existing system at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` played by the rules.'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said his subcommittee's staff last week visited <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>'s 326-unit Seabrook project in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, a 1940s complex that <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>'s partnership is renovating with the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> subsidies. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said his staff found apartments renting for more than $ 700 a month, including federal subsidies, but lacking gutters and refrigerators. Some had suffered water damage, he said. `` What they saw and heard was shocking, particularly for a project that is costing taxpayers $ 31,163,400 in rent subsidies alone, plus additional millions in tax credits,'' he said. Referring to the game of `` Monopoly,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said: `` For well over $ 31 million, I would have expected at least <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardens </PERSON>. Unfortunately we have here only a slum on Baltic or Mediterranean Avenue.'' <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, a former campaign adviser to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and a former business partner of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, underwent contentious questioning from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing. <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> said that while 182 units are occupied, construction is still under way and asserted, `` When we are finished with construction, we believe the tenants will be happy.'' When he appeared before the panel in June, <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> acknowledged that his work amounted to `` influence-peddling.'' However, on Monday he denied receiving an advance tip by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> insiders on the availability of subsidies for renovating low-income housing projects, which were prized profit-makers for developers. He said he had little contact with <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, the former executive assistant to former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> who is a focus of the panel's probe into alleged political influence-peddling at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. Dean, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and two other former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials have refused to testify on constitutional grounds. But two associates in <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>'s lobbying company acknowledged further contacts with <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Gay </PERSON> testified he met with <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> and discussed the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> project. Another associate, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, was a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> liaison to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> who said he had been in contact with <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> daily while in government. <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> contended that partners in the development faced normal business risks, including the potential loss of a $ 450,000 down payment, in buying the dilapidated housing and putting together a package of subsidies and financing. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, however, contended <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> had enjoyed an inside line to top <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials and was able to bypass procedures at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office `` This was a greased, sweetheart deal, where all the participants knew what the final outcome would be,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> promised them the units -LRB- of subsidy -RRB- and she delivered on the units. Those are the facts.''

 A clergyman Tuesday sued the state <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for denying him a job because he is a homosexual. Former hospital chaplain <PERSON> Jens </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, 41, was refused a job with the council in March. Council spokesman <PERSON> Gunnar </PERSON> <PERSON> Vestermoen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> was not hired because he had lived with his homosexual partner of seven years, in violation of church teachings. `` He was the first choice and was obviously well-qualified ... but the council dropped him because he lived in a homosexual relationship,'' said <PERSON> Vestermoen </PERSON>. The case went to court two days after a law took effect in neighboring <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> allowing homosexual couples to be registered as `` partners'' by civil authorities, with all the rights of married heterosexual couples except adopting children. Eleven male couples were `` married'' there Sunday. About 130 church workers, including clergymen, have supported <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> through petitions and newspaper advertisements. `` Support is warming up ... I am not alone within the church in my views. The church discriminates against homosexuals,'' <PERSON> Oslen </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION>. Supporters have cited a 1977 church decision to stop condemning latent homosexuality to argue <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>'s case. `` It is meaningless ... to treat feelings and practice differently,'' said theology professor <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jervell </PERSON>. `` The council accepts homosexuals but says it is wrong for them to live together,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday it is spending nearly $ 700,000 on model programs to encourage people in 10 states - including <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> farmers, <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> blacks and tourists in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> casinos - to eat less fat. `` We are taking this campaign to the heartland of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarlov </PERSON>, president of the foundation, said in announcing the two-year grants under the foundation's Project LEAN, an acronym for Low-fat Eating for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> Now. He said the programs will be monitored for their effectiveness by teams from the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and vary widely from state to state. `` Thus, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the Project LEAN program will focus on reaching blacks and Hispanics in four communities - <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Bedford-Stuyvesant </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Baltimore will be targeting the 60 percent of the city's population that is non-white by aiming at 24 contiguous neighborhoods in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary for health, said minorities, the elderly and low-income people `` have higher rates of chronic diseases than the general population, and they can also be the most difficult to reach with the information and support that can foster beneficial change in health behaviors.'' `` <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> will be trying to reduce fat consumption in one of the key farm states,'' <PERSON> Tarlov </PERSON> said. `` And <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> will be targeting the millions of tourists eating out during their vacations and conventions.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, director of lifestyle assessment for the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said project workers in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> would help supermarkets mark shelves to identify low-fat foods.

In addition, a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> organization called Creative Community would present skits and other performances on the theme of more healthy eating. The grants are: _ To the <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, $ 60,000 to expand a program of dietician-led tours in supermarkets, shopping guides and recipes. _ To the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, $ 70,000 in support of a coalition including the <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beef </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a supermarket chain and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. _ To the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, $ 70,000 to reduce fats in the diets of inner-city residents in collaboration with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> for High Blood Pressure. _ To the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, $ 70,000 for a program aimed at reducing fat consumption among blacks and Hispanics, using Project Lean materials and other resources. _ To the <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> $ 70,000 for programs in supermarkets, work sites and schools and a media campaign. _ To the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, $ 70,000 for a program targeting the casino and restaurant industries in an effort to reduce fat consumption of tourists and others eating away from home. _ To the <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> $ 60,000 for a supermarket and media campaign. _ To the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, $ 70,000 for a program aimed at public school curricula, school lunch programs and retail supermarkets in <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wasatch </LOCATION> counties. _ To the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> for a statewide information campaign and targeted efforts in the <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> health districts. _ To the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> for coordination of statewide and community campaigns through the media, food outlets, professional health organizations and public events.

 The secret to eternal life may be retirement abroad _ at least for people who receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government benefits. Judging from available records, such people never die; they just keep collecting their checks, the inspector general of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. `` Those program benefits go on forever and ever,'' Inspector General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> said the government does n't know how widespread the problem is, or how costly, or where it is greatest, because <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> depends on local governments and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to validate deaths and tell <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> when to stop checks. `` In rural <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> ... a local constabulary is going to stop a benefit from going into a village? No,'' he told the panel. <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> said he's also suspicious of the long lifespans of people who retire to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where the benefits are distributed through the government. But there's no evidence of wrongdoing, he said. The panel's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, suggested proof could be found `` when you have people who are obviously 120 years old'' collecting benefits. The department's independent auditor said he liked a suggestion by Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, to impose regular check-in requirements on people collecting benefits abroad. `` I think it's a good idea that periodically they should produce evidence that they are alive and well,'' <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> said. `` Pretty soon we'll find people living throughout the world and not just <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> will never die.''

 No common-law marriage exists between <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, a judge ruled today, precluding <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>'s former live-in lover from claiming nearly half `` The Big Chill'' star's movie millions <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Silbermann </PERSON> said that the relationship was illicit when it began because <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> was married to someone else, and that it did not become legitimate simply because the actor got divorced. `` Absent proof of a mutual agreement to be married, an agreement to marry can not be inferred from the fact that the parties were living together,'' the judge said. `` The contrary is true.'' If the judge had determined the two were married under common law, Ms. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> could have pursued up to half Hurt's earnings. The decision did not deal with support for the couple's 6-year-old son, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Devon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>, called the ruling a `` joke'' and said he would appeal. The judge is `` so madly in love with this defendant, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, that we never could have gotten a fair shake,'' he said. `` If we had won, I would have been shocked,'' <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, a former dancer, sued Hurt for equitable distribution of his assets, estimated by <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> at $ 5 million to $ 7 million, after Hurt refused to increase financial support to her and their son. Under an agreement between Hurt and <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, he was paying them $ 60,000 to $ 65,000 a year. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, 32, based her suit on four of the 10 weeks she spent with Hurt in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, during the winter of 1982-83 while he was there filming `` The Big Chill.'' The movie was about a reunion of 1960s-era college chums. Common-law marriages were abolished in 1933 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and Hurt also lived, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> recognizes such unions. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> contended that during the four weeks between Dec. 9, when Hurt learned actress <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> had divorced him, and Jan. 10, when <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> left the state, a common-law marriage existed between them. Hurt's publicist, <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, was at the courthouse waiting with reporters when copies of the decision were handed out, and she distributed a statement from the actor, who has starred in such films as `` Body Heat,'' `` Children of a Lesser God,'' `` Kiss of the Spider Woman'' and `` The Accidental Tourist.'' `` I am thankful for the ruling received today, which is a vindication of everything I have said and that has been said by those who have supported me,'' the statement said. Hurt was `` perplexed'' when <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> brought the suit, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Prior to trial, Hurt had suggested <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> was trying to simply shake him down for more support.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed Tuesday to consider a request that it nullify President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s decision not to let her predecessor, <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, be buried in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, the former president's widow, pledged to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for trial on charges of embezzling <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government funds if she was permitted to bury her husband, who died Thursday in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> at age 72, in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> ruled the archipelago for 20 years until a civilian-military uprising drove him into exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in February 1986. Several coups have been attempted by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> says the return of the body or of members of the family could cause unrest. Philippine officials charge that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, his family and associates looted the country of up to $ 10 billion during his time in power. Sen. <PERSON> Leticia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos-Shahani </PERSON>, who is related to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> but supports Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, urged Tuesday that the government begin negotiations with the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family toward allowing the former president to be buried in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> `` at the appropriate time.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ramos-Shahani </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> should be buried in his home province, <PERSON> Ilocos </PERSON> <PERSON> Norte </PERSON>, with the family allowed to attend the funeral. `` The two parties should be given time to find a mutually acceptable agreement,'' said the senator, who is the sister of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> amd head of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee on foreign relations. Asked by The Associated Press how soon the body should be returned, she said: `` One or two months.'' Former Sen. <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolentino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' running mate in 1986, said Monday the body could be flown directly to the international airport at <LOCATION> Laoag </LOCATION>, capital of <ORGANIZATION> Ilocos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION>, instead of passing through <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Laoag </LOCATION> is about 250 miles north of the capital. Also Monday, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s ban and allow <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and her three children to bring the body to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The court agreed Tuesday to consider the petition, and Justice <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> said the government was given 10 days to respond. Solicitor-General <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said the government would argue that the issue is political, not legal, and that Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> might use the opportunity to evade prosecution in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been prohibited from leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where she is to be tried in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in March on charges of embezzling <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government money and investing some of it in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Marcoses were indicted in October and Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is free on $ 5 million bond. `` I will have to go back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> because I have to face the indictment,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> DZXL </ORGANIZATION> in an interview from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> on Tuesday. `` What I am defending here is not only the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> name, but the entire nation.'' The government anti-graft court temporarily suspended proceedings Tuesday in the first of 35 civil suits against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Government lawyers said they would file a petition soon to substitute either the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> estate or the late president's executor as a defendant In the appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters claimed Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s refusal to permit burial in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> violates the constitution. On Sept. 15, before <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> died, the court ruled 8-7 that his return would be a threat to security.

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-abortion forces today introduced a bill to put sweeping restrictions on abortion At a news conference, Republican Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Freind </PERSON> said the legislation would directly challenge <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> and give the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> another chance to overturn its 1973 ruling establishing the right to an abortion. Earlier this year, the high court gave states broader powers to restrict abortions. Freind's bill, which has the backing of Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, could be the first to be adopted since that ruling in July. The suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> legislator, who arrived at the news conference under police guard and was picketed by abortion-rights advocates, said his bill would: _ Require a 24-hour waiting period before a woman can have an abortion. _ Outlaw all abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy except to save the woman's life. _ Ban abortions by women who want to choose the sex of a child. _ Require notification of the spouse before a woman has an abortion. The high court has previously rejected such notification laws. `` We are very encouraged that the legislation will be passed by the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Legislature,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beliveau </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Pro-Life Federation. Abortion-rights advocates today introduced their legislative package, including a proposed constitutional amendment establishing a right to an abortion. The pro-choice bills would also restore government funding for poor women who have medically necessary abortions and would weaken a law requiring parental notification or a court order before a minor can obtain an abortion. That provision is not in effect because it is under court review. While <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> historically has opposed abortion, pro-choice advocates said today that most <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> voters support the right to choose. In a poll of 500 likely voters, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> said 60 percent favored keeping abortion legal, while 33 percent wanted to outlaw it. `` This data shows how dramatically out-of-step <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s officials are with their constituents on abortion,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, the league's executive director `` The political atmosphere surrounding choice is more highly charged than ever. ... Politicians in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> who support abortion restrictions in 1989 may well be voted out of office in 1990.'' The poll, taken Sept. 25-28 by <ORGANIZATION> Hickman-Maslin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 points.

 The Soviet legislature today imposed a selective ban on strikes in key economic areas in a compromise with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal for a complete ban. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he was satisfied with the compromise, and that it would `` help restore a normal life.'' `` This is a decision in support of perestroika,'' he said. A day after hearing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal to ban all strikes for the next 15 months, a joint session of the Supreme Soviet's two chambers spent all of today in confused debate before arriving at a weakened version. In the end, it approved by a vote of 364-6 a temporary ban on strikes in the industries of transport, energy, metallurgy and all raw materials until it can approve full legislation governing strikes. A detailed law regulating strikes may be ready as soon as next week. A draft law bans strikes that could threaten the lives or health of people, and also in transportation, communications, energy, defense industries and government organs. However, many of the key issues in the draft have not yet been approved. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> repeated his warning that the Soviet economy is threatened by waves of politically motivated job actions, but did not call again for an outright ban on all strikes. Deputies included in their decision language that would allow the country's ministries of interior, defense and transport to take over railroads in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> if necessary to get rail traffic moving again to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Earlier, during a break in the debate, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministery </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> called the proposed strike ban unconstitutional. `` We do n't have a basis for deciding what is an extraordinary situation,'' he said. <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON>, a deputy premier in charge of economic reform, said the initiative to change the draft resolution came during an overnight meeting of deputies and not from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Everyone wants to be sympathethic, wants the public to like them, and nobody wants to take the responsibility,'' he said. <PERSON> Marju </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauristin </PERSON>, a deputy and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said she favored a limit on strikes called for political reasons, which she said could be used as an excuse for military intervention. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in calling for a ban on strikes, called the measure necessary `` to protect democratization from anarchy and irresponsible management.'' By inserting the threat to take over operations and security on the country's railroads, the legislators were acting to bring an end to a blockade by Azerbaijanis of rail lines leading from their republic into <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Soviet law does not ban strikes outright. But labor unrest was ruthlessly repressed before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power in 1985 and began his effort to turn the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into a country ruled by law instead of dictate. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Monday that his proposal to ban strikes was `` not an effort to stop the processes that are underway in the framework of perestroika.'' A key element of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms is perestroika, or restructuring the Soviet's <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s stumbling and shortage-ridden economy, and the Soviet leader said that economic transformation is `` under threat'' because of strikes. First Deputy Premier <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON> told lawmakers Monday that the economy lost $ 6.15 billion in July and August because of strikes and supplies of fuel are so low the country might be unable to provide enough heat for citizens through the winter. A letter dated Sept. 29 and read out to the Supreme Soviet from the <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> suggested that extreme action was needed to restore the `` rhythym of labor'' in the country. The most damaging strike this year was a walkout in July by thousands of coal miners in the far north, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, and the <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Basin </PERSON> of the eastern <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. That strike cost the country millions of rubles and the government agreed to a package of economic and social improvements that officials said will cost about $ 3 billion. Strikes also have become a way of expressing ethnic discontent. They have afflicted <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a disputed predominantly Armenian enclave in the southern republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. And Russian workers in <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> have struck to protest local laws they say favor the majority Estonians and Moldavians. The package of laws under discussion includes the proposed creation of a `` special form of administration'' for railroads in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics, where Azerbaijanis reportedly blocked shipments of goods to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Another proposal put forth at today's session was a price freeze on all food and manufactured goods. The measure was proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, a part of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, Prices and Social policy.

 A bomb exploded outside an apartment building in the Turkish sector of <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> early Tuesday, shattering windows but causing no injuries.

He told reporters he did not believe there was a political motive behind the explosion. <PERSON> Durduran </PERSON> said his statements against smugglers of drugs, arms and antiquities on the island made him a target. Turkish Cypriot police were investigating the incident. Also Tuesday, officials from the main opposition leftist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turkish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> found a bomb in front of the party offices, said party leader Ozker Ozgur. It was deactivated before it exploded. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> has been divided into northern Turkish and southern Greek Cypriot sectors since Turkish troops invaded the island following an Athens-backed coup in 1974.

<HEAD>Government Cuts Salaries of President, Top Officials</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The government cut in half the salary of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s leader, and top officials' salaries were slashed up to 33 percent in an effort to reduce the budget deficit, an official newspaper said Tuesday. An <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> communique published in L'Union, the government's daily newspaper, said Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril's $ 10,000 a month salary has been reduced to $ 5,000. It said a 33 percent salary cut would apply to <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers, who earned $ 3,500 before the cut. The salary cuts, effective for six months starting Oct. 1, `` are part of a strategy which aims at lessening the ills of the present economic crisis,'' the communique said. A 20 percent salary cut was applied to top civil servants earning $ 1,500 monthly, and 10 percent was deducted from the salaries of public workers earning $ 1,000 monthly. The average annual income in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> is less than $ 300 a year. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, one of the world's poorest nations, has a deficit of $ 60 million. The foreign debt is $ 800 million, three times more than the annual budget. Government salaries account for 75 percent of the budget, <PERSON> L'Union </PERSON> said. The move came a week after a 24-hour strike shut down virtually all businesses and transport in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation of 6 million. The strike was called by leftist and conservative groups to protest austerity measures imposed to win a $ 26.5 million loan from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. The day after the strike, <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> conceded the strikers' demands were just but said he had no choice but to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> because `` we had a knife to our throat.''

<HEAD>Court Ruling Upends Age-Bias Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some 4,000 <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> retirees who thought they had won $ 35 million in an age discrimination suit may have lost it all as a result of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, a legal specialist says. The high court Monday overturned a lower-court ruling that the Pittsburgh-based electronics and electric power giant had discriminated against the retirees by forcing them to choose between severance pay or early pensions. A judge had ruled in the retirees' favor and <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, representing the retirees, settled out of court in 1988 for $ 35 million, or an average of $ 8,700 per person. But the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> backed out of the settlement in hope of a bigger award in court. In the meantime, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> pursued the case to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> _ and won. `` It means they blew it. They got greedy, in my opinion,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauver </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> pension lawyer not involved in the case. `` They chose to forgo a very favorable settlement to get a favorable court decision.'' However, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, special assistant to the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> general counsel in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the case `` is far from over.'' `` There are still a number of areas for the court to decide,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> case was the commission's biggest age discrimination settlement. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> said it was delighted with Monday's ruling.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders announced today an aid program for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> that includes $ 887 million in food and other economic assistance and said they have invited Solidarity union leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to address a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> next month. Denouncing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration aid efforts to date as `` grossly inadequate,'' the Democrats proposed a package that also includes a five-year moratorium on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s $ 2.5 billion debt to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and $ 1.4 billion in loans from international lending institutions. The package would include the authorization of $ 887 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food and economic aid over the next three years. This contrasts with the administation's commitment to date to provide a total $ 255 million in assistance to the two East European nations stuggling to discard communist rule and build democratic institutions and free markets. The announcement came at a news conference held by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and about 10 other Democratic figures in both houses <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has been invited to speak before a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 15, one of the rare occasions in <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. history when such an assembly will have been addressed by a person who is not a head of state or government. Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., said the legislation implementing the aid package will be sped through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as quickly as possible in light of the fact that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has nearly exhausted its foreign currency reserves He said the bill will urge the administration to seek a one-year standby $ 700 million loan from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and a $ 765 million loan from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The legislation also will urge the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to direct the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> to make up to $ 1 billion available to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> from currency stabilization funds, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said that of the $ 887 million authorization for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, it is contemplated that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be asked to appropriate $ 415 million for the 1990 fiscal year which opened on Oct. 1. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds would be obtained by trimming other programs for which funds have already been appropriated, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. `` We intend to provide the leadership that has been lacking up until now,'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingel </PERSON>, D-Mich., told the news conference `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> program is grossly inadequate.'' `` This is a new and meaningful initiative,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` The administration's response to these historic events in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has been woefully inadequate. In my viuew the admimnistration has failed completely to understand the historic nature of what has occurred.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is supporting <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s communist government with the largest military airlift in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> history, Western diplomatic sources said Tuesday They said more than 3,800 supply flights landed in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> from Feb. 15, when the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> withdrew after nine years of involvement in the Afghan civil war, and the beginning of September. The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, estimated Soviet military aid to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> during the first half of 1989 was worth more than $ 1.5 billion. Equipment delivered includes medium-range missiles, tanks and other armored vehicles, artillery, and MiG-21 and Sukhoi-25 jet fighters, the sources reported. Moslem rebels, supported by neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, regularly raid or have cut most roads linking cities, making overland supply difficult and dangerous. Government forces hold the major cities, but guerrillas control much of the mountainous countryside after more than 11 years of civil war. Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said Tuesday her government was working with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on a political solution to the Afghan conflict. `` We are discussing with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a consensus resolution on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> which will be presented at the current session of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>,'' she told reporters in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> at the end of a three-day visit to <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. She did not elaborate. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said a broad-based representative government was the only way `` to peace and stability in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' She also said a `` conducive condition'' should be created in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> for the return of more than 3.5 million Afghans who have fled to cities and camps inside <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Moslem guerrillas began fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after a communist coup in April 1978. The major insurgent groups are based in <LOCATION> Paksitan </LOCATION>. Diplomats and guerrilla spokesman say battles occur regularly along the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, which connects <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> with the Soviet border 210 miles to the north. They said the army had sent reinforcements to help fight guerrillas who fire at convoys from the mountains. Many trucks that make it to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> use a detour built just north of the city, where guerrillas have controlled a 21-mile stretch of the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> since June, the diplomats reported. Heavy attacks by insurgents also were reported on convoys bound for <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> in the southeast, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s second-largest city. Diplomats said guerrillas firing rockets and anti-tank weapons stopped half of a 1,000-unit convoy approaching the city and destroyed more than 100 vehicles.

 Six explorers crossing <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> on skis and sleds remained trapped Tuesday by a mountain snowstorm but were out of immediate danger after a support crew airlifted in food and three fresh dogs. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasperini </PERSON> said from the expedition's <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> headquarters that the hurricane-force winds that had kept the adventurers in their tents abated over the weekend. However, she said above-zero temperatures brought 3 -LCB- feet of fresh snow, making it impossible for the dogs to travel. Winds of 20 mph Monday night helped pack the surface and left the snow knee-deep, she said Tuesday. If the relatively light winds continue, the expedition expects to travel Wednesday toward a food cache about 15 miles away at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vang </LOCATION>. High winds, low visibility and deep snow have put the unprecedented 4,000-mile traverse of <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> as much as a week behind schedule. But the lost time could be made up once the team leaves the mountainous <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and reaches <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vang </LOCATION>, the beginning of the flat ice plateau that makes up the continent's interior, <PERSON> Gasperini </PERSON> said The mushers have traveled 630 miles since July 27. On Saturday, a Twin Otter airplane reached the crew on the trail, bringing needed food and airlifting out 15 exhausted dogs. The three additional dogs leave the crew with 24 rather than 36 sled dogs, but the six adventurers have lightened their load by sending out one of their three tents.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> agreed today to let as many as 11,000 East Germans inside and outside the West German embassy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> travel to the West, a top-ranking official in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> said. The first train of East German refugees will depart <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> some time after 8 p.m., said <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON>, chief of staff to Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. It was the second time within a week that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had reluctantly agreed to allow its citizens to emigrate West. Last weekend, about 7,000 refugees fled to the West from West German embassies in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The agreement covers 4,700 East Germans inside the embassy and thousands more who raced to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in hopes of gaining passage to the West, but were unable to get into the overfilled embassy compound, <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> said. Earlier today, about 250 East Germans stormed past police and into the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, and witnesses said some refugees were injured. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> then blocked citizens from traveling to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in an effort to stem the flow to the West. Until today, East Germans needed neither a visa nor a passport to travel to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said that effective immediately, such documents would be required. That will effectively block ordinary citizens from going there. The ADN dispatch said the move was based on reports indicating `` that certain circles in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are preparing provocations in conjunction with the celebrations of our 40th anniversary'' on Saturday. ADN did not say anything about changes in travel to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where East Germans also have holed up in the West German Embassy. East Germans currently need government permission to travel to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, chief government spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> earlier had refused to talk to West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> by telephone about the refugee crisis. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> aides said that preparations for Saturday's 40th anniversary of the Communist nation precluded an `` appointment for a telephone call,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. The anniversary celebration, which is to include a visit by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, comes amid perhaps <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s most embarrassing diplomatic crisis: the exodus of thousands of its citizens. In another development, the Soviet Communist Party daily Pravda accused <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of interfering in East German affairs by allowing its embassies in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> to grant asylum to refugees. `` Political leaders of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have made naked attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' Pravda said. Before today's announcment, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had said last weekend's exodus was a one-time occurrence and demanded that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> expel the thousands of other would-be emigres who subsequently converged on the missions to follow their countrymen to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> After breaking the police lines at the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> embassy, the East Germans scaled a 2-yard-high fence to join the approximately 4,500 refugees already inside embassy grounds. The crowd broke into the embassy after <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> closed the compound because of intense crowding, and hundreds of East Germans waited outside, the numbers increasing hourly, witnesses said. They said about 500 people reportedly gathered around the embassy, some even sitting on nearby rooftops. Between 200 and 250 East Germans waiting outside the embassy compound finally stormed through barricades around the embassy garden fence, climbing into the compound, they said. When the refugees battled police who tried to stop them, many were injured, some from jumping from the fence, the witnesses said. The number of injured was not immediately known. West German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothen </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> that the situation in the embassy had become `` unbearable. It's horribly crowded.'' After clashes late Monday evening between truncheon-wielding police and East Germans trying to reach the embassy, police lifted their controls at the main gate, allowing them to enter but continuing to patrol the garden fence. West German sources said the embassy had been closed at the request of the German <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, which was concerned about sanitation problems. About 1,000 children were said by refugees to be among those in the embassy. People were sleeping three to a bed in the tents scattered across the embassy grounds, refugees said. Czechoslovak government spokesman <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> said the swelling numbers of East Germans `` seriously upsets public order'' in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and the government reserved the right to take `` indispensable measures to maintain and restore public order.'' He said other embassies in the area, including the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, had requested increased protection. <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> said in a statement carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency that `` relevant Czechoslovak authorities'' had provided necessary supplies and `` humanitarian, medical and other technical assistance.'' He criticized <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as irresponsible for allowing the refugees to enter the building after allegedly assuring <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> that last weekend's situation would not be repeated. In the West German embassy in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, the number of East Germans who have arrived in the past two days reached about 300, <PERSON> Rothen </PERSON> said, but he acknowledged the number could be higher. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> restricted travel to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> after that country's liberal leaders opened their border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> on Sept. 10 and thousands of East Germans fled West across it More than 20,000 have crossed through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since then. East Germans unable to reach <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> then began converging on the West German embassies in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> are two liberal <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations growing increasingly distant from such hard-line allies as <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The East German opposition group New Forum on Monday criticized the country's Communist leaders for agreeing to the weekend release, saying in a statement that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is `` losing a village every day.'' So far this year more than 120,000 East Germans have reached <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where they are granted automatic citizenship. The exodus of the mostly young, skilled workers has hurt <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s economy In <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, on Monday, nearly 20,000 people marched to demand legalization of opposition groups and adoption of democratic reforms in the country's largest such protest since 1953. Witnesses said security officials followed the demonstration but did not try to break it up.

<HEAD>Kinnock Says Labor `Ready to Negotiate' With New Nuclear Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRIGHTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opposition leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> said Tuesday his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is ready to `` start being negotiators'' in government following its renunciation of unilateral nuclear disarmament. `` It is encouraging _ an inspiration _ to see the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> working together ... exuding to the British people the feeling that we are fit to serve our country,'' <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> said in his keynote address on the second day of the party's annual conference in this south <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> resort. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, confident the weeklong conference will endorse a major policy overhaul shifting the socialist movement to the center, added that Britons `` respect us for the changes we have made and are making.'' <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, who received a thunderous reception from the 1,500 delegates, has clamped down on Labor's left wing and transformed the party's poll ratings in the past year. The party, consistently ahead in the polls since late spring, is now in its strongest position since its third successive defeat by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservatives in 1987. The next election must be called by mid-1992. The new defense policy, stipulating that a Labor-led government would give up <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> nuclear weapons only as part of a negotiated arms deal, is part of the new policy. It also ditches some other vote-losers, such as pledges of widespread nationalization. `` We seek the power ... to stop being spectators and start being negotiators,'' said <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> during his speech.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Gain Not as Strong as It Seems</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods rose 2.9 percent in August, the government said Tuesday, but analysts said a one-month boost from automobile orders belies the weakness in the industrial sector. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that orders for both durable and nondurable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $ 237.2 billion after declining 2 percent in July to $ 230.5 billion, the lowest level since last November. Orders rose 0.6 percent in June. The August gain was driven by the transportation sector, which rose 6.9 percent despite a decline in the aircraft component. Orders for automobiles posted a big increase because of end-of-the-model-year sales incentives. `` But the auto sales were a temporary phenomenon,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Basically, the industrial sector has slowed down,'' he said. `` American consumers are spending less, exports are still strong but ... they are falling down too. Domestic capital spending is beginning to evaporate.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said the factory sector would continue to be `` quite sluggish'' for the rest of the year and into 1990. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cynwyd </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, also sees the industrial sector continuing to slow, `` flip-flopping'' from one month to the next. The Commerce report showed orders for durable goods _ `` big ticket'' items expected to last more than three year _ rose 3.9 percent in August, up from the 3.8 percent initially reported last week. Nondurable goods orders were up 1.8 percent. In addition to transportation, the non-electrical machinery durable goods component, which includes computers, registered a gain, up 9.3 percent. But orders for electrical machinery fell 2.1 percent, mostly due to defense communicaioons equipment, while primary metals were off 1.8 percent. In the influential category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of business investment plans, orders fell 10.1 percent in August after rising 5.9 percent in July. Shipments of manufactured goods rose 5.6 percent, the sharpest increase in the current economic expansion, which began in 1982. Shipments had fallen 2.3 percent in July, the sharpest drop since March 1986. Inventories rose 0.3 percent, the smallest increase in the last two years, but <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> attributed this more to recently improved inventory control than to increased demand.

<HEAD>Selectmen Trying to Sell Only Store</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAVOY, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This rural community has been trying to unload its former town hall building for several years, while hoping a new owner wo n't kick out the only store in town. `` There's nothing much I can do. It's their property,'' store owner <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Tuesday. <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, 58, who has been ill for some years, said he would n't mind selling his business, although he does n't feel town officials appreciate the service he's provided <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> has run the retail store for 35 years, paying the town $ 100 a month rent. The store in this town of about 600, tucked into a fold of the <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION>, is the only place to buy such necessities as bread and milk, along with such traditional staples as penny candy, <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said. `` Some of it's a nickel or a dime now, though,'' he added. No one really knows how the store wound up in the old town hall building, which was built in the early 1900s but has since been replaced. `` That goes way, way back,'' said Selectman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>. `` I know that the upstairs part of the building has forever been a town hall, that was closed down about three years ago because of fire regulations.'' `` That's where the town met and danced and ate and had their meetings and everything,'' he said. Officials hoped a buyer would keep the store as a tenant, although that was not a requirement of the sale. The closest town is <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, about eight miles away. Town residents first decided to sell the building and land in 1985, because it lacks the capital to make repairs. At first, a sale was delayed by a boundary dispute with the next-door <ORGANIZATION> Savoy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. After that was settled in 1988, voters put a special condition on the sale that any buyer would have to continue to operate it as a retail outlet. That effort to sell ended with no bids submitted. Now the building and land are up for sale without restrictions and buyers would have to negotiate with <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> for the business, <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> said. No price was set for the store, he said. Store assistant <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said the store is in need of repairs, particularly the leaking porch roof. She said <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> has suggested increasing the amount he pays the town to get an official lease, making it worthwhile to do some repair work. But, she said, that was rejected because of the desire to sell.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan for $ 9 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid for the Nicaraguan elections moved ahead in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday despite misgivings from Democrats who said the idea amounted to blatant interference in another country's politics. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on a voice vote, sent the measure to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after defeating a move to slash the package to just $ 400,000 to pay for election observers. The House was scheduled to take up the measure on Wednesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal provides $ 5 million to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, a quasi-governmental agency which promotes democratic processes in other countries, and $ 4 million for other `` election support.'' Some support could go directly to the opposition coalition supporting presidential candidate <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, who is challenging <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista-backed President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. The panel earmarked portions of the $ 4 million for specific organizations: $ 400,000 for an election observer team led by former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>; $ 400,000 for the Center for Training and Election Promotion; and $ 250,000 for the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>. One effect of the earmarks was to lower the maximum amount that could go directly to the opposition coalition to about $ 1.5 million, with a like amount going to the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> as a tax required by Nicaraguan law. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., called the package `` a turkey'' and `` misguided,'' but urged fellow <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members to send the measure to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in accord with a promise to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., called the package necessary to seize an opportunity `` to see whether democracy can be brought to that country. In a related development, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Antony </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilenson </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the bill providing money for the nation's intelligence agencies for next year contains no money for covert <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in the Feb. 25, 1990 election The administration could undertake covert action only by coming to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ask for a transfer of money from other programs, which would give lawmakers a chance to veto such a move, he said. `` Covertly supporting the opposition in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would be unwise as well as unnecessary and counterproductive,'' <PERSON> Beilenson </PERSON> said in a Rules Committee hearing. `` We have accepted the administration's statements that it will not embark on this path.''

<HEAD>Ruthless, Noreiga Dealt With Everyone From CIA to Colombian Cartels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> dealt with everyone from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to Colombian cocaine cartels as he clawed his way to power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and defied <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> efforts to oust him. On Tuesday, elements of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> claimed they had deposed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. But the wily strongman's whereabouts were not known and forces loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said they were resisting a coup attempt. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, 51, rose from poverty to the pinnacle of Panamanian power through the ranks of the Defense Forces. He was raised by foster parents and joined the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> in 1962 after attending military college in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> on a scholarship. His ascent began when he caught the attention of an ambitious young officer named <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>. Less than a year after the charismatic <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> took power in a 1968 coup, he made <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, then an obscure major, chief of intelligence with the rank of lieutenant colonel. It was like having the keys to the city. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> immediately began assembling dossiers on everyone who counted in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Information was power. His new post also gave him jurisidiction over customs and immigration, long lucrative sources of income for the military. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s new job also put him in close contact with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies. He formed powerful alliances. When <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> died in an unexplained plane crash in 1981, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was poised to shoulder his way to the top of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. In 1983, he assumed command of the 15,000-man force. Wealth and power were his. He acquired a fleet of expensive cars, a home in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s most exclusive neighborhood and is reputed to have a finger in a vast array of lucrative businesses, including hotels, maritime services, gambling casinos, a television station, a dozen radio stations, maritime services, duty-free liquor stores and prostitution <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> exercised his power with ruthless assurance. He had little tolerance for criticism. He would close newspapers for months at a time and presidents served at his pleasure. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, long his close ally, began to move away from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after the headless body of one of his most vocal opponents, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Spadadora </PERSON>, turned up in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mailbag in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Spadadora </PERSON> had publicly accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of drug trafficking. The full break with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> came in 1988, when two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on charges drug trafficking. He was accused of selling out his country to the drug lords of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, of turning <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> into a drug transshipment point and a haven for money laundering. The domestic opposition, heartened by the indictments, began to intensify its campaign to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed crippling economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The general did n't bend an inch. Instead, he cloaked himself in <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>' nationalist banner, accusing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of plotting to renege on the 1977 treaties that put the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> in local hands at the end of the century. Control of the canal, linking the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> oceans, has long been an emotional issue in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. When international observers said the opposition had won the May 7 general election, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> simply had the balloting annulled and installed yet another president, the sixth since he took command of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. Shortly after his indictment <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> gave a dramatic speech that seemed to epitomize the strongman and his steely intransigence. The strongman brandished a machete above his head, then brought it crashing down on the podium. `` Ni un paso atras,'' he shouted, his pock-marked face contorted. `` Not one step back.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Editors Urged To Be `Fanatical' on Community Ties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's newspaper editors must be `` fanatical'' about developing ties to their communities if they hope to reverse a slide in readership, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Managing Editors said Tuesday. `` We must get closer to our communities,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Janensch </PERSON>, editor and general manager of The <ORGANIZATION> Rockland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s suburban <LOCATION> Rockland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` Call it what you will _ customer obsession, putting the reader first, serving the constituents _ we must do it better,'' he said. `` I firmly believe that if we build a strong rapport with our communities, we will prosper. If we do n't, we will fade away.'' As he opened the annual APME convention, <PERSON> Janensch </PERSON> pointed to figures showing that newspaper readership is declining. `` In 1967, about 73 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adults said they read a newspaper every day,'' he said. `` Last year, the number was down to 51 percent.'' <PERSON> Janensch </PERSON> said steadily declining readership `` confronts us with the most serious problem facing newspapers today'' and said it even hits markets where the economy is booming. `` If you are lucky enough to be in a growing market and your circulation is going up, you may think you do n't have a problem,'' he said. `` Wrong. Even where circulation is going up, net newspaper penetration is going down. There are no exceptions.'' Frequently lost in the daily pressure of publishing, <PERSON> Janensch </PERSON> said, is the need to establish links between a newspaper and the community. `` We all know the answer, but we lose sight of it solving our day-to-day newsroom problems,'' he said. `` We lose sight of it wrestling with budgets, performance evaluations and other administrative matters.'' `` Do you hear what the people in your community are saying about your newspaper?'' he asked. `` Do you know what they like? Do you know what ticks them off?'' Surveying readers ca n't substitute for basics of business, such as customer service, he said. `` Readership surveys can be useful, but they are n't enough,'' <PERSON> Janensch </PERSON> said. `` Surveys ca n't halt sliding readership unless the editor and the editor's staff are fanatical about getting close to the community.'' While many are captivated by national news and big-name events, most of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s newspapers survive by providing residents of the community with information they need in their daily lives, he said. `` Is your newspaper first and foremost a local newspaper?'' asked <PERSON> Janensch </PERSON>. `` Do you care as much about the expansion of a local business as you do about the national trade deficit?'' In addition to building community ties, <PERSON> Janensch </PERSON> said, a newspaper's staff must reflect the paper's market. `` Does your staff at all levels reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of your target readership?'' he asked the editors. `` Are about half of your staffers women? Do your staffers have roots in the community?'' Without that commitment to community, <PERSON> Janensch </PERSON> said, the steady decline in newspaper readership will inevitably continue, costing newspapers advertising revenue, and that in turn tightens budgets and damages the news product. `` The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> might be able to survive with 10 or 15 percent of its primary market, but can you?'' <PERSON> Janensch </PERSON> asked editors. The <ORGANIZATION> APME </ORGANIZATION> is an association of editors from member newspapers of The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

The suspect was being deported to <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> following the rejection by Dutch authorities of his asylum request here, the spokesman said. There was no immediate word how many people were aboard the Airbus, which seats at least 260 people. The suspect was not identified, in line with Dutch police practice. According to <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, the man was not under police guard when the incident occurred.

We have very able military officers who are advising us of the situation on the ground. `` But beyond that I would simply add to the rumors if I commented further. And we are watching the situation with the No. 1 priority the lives of Americans. `` There were rumors around that this was some American operation and I can tell you that is not true.'' Asked if he was willing to help the Panamanian Defense Forces, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` Again, that's part of the confusion. Nobody is sure what's happening there People on the ground have the best idea about that. `` But I would repeat in the hopes that it be conveyed instantly to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>: we have no argument with the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. We have no argument with them. We've had good relations with the Panamanian Defense Forces. Our argument has been, as has many other countries, with Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> who aborted the democratic will of the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. And that's where our argument was and that's where our argument is `` And so if you can use all these cameras to get that message to the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, I really think it would be a good thing for peace and I think it would be a good thing in terms of a historic relationship between our two countries that I value and that all Americans want to see improved.

 A man who helped kill and dismember a prostitute in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is violating his probation by being in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, but <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> does n't want him and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> officials said Tuesday they ca n't hold him. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON>, 29, and two other men killed <PERSON> Kimberley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and cut up her body with a chain saw in March 1985. <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>'s body was found in a freezer three years later. After his arrest last year, <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON> pleaded guilty to charges of second-degree murder, kidnapping and sexual battery. But he was granted immunity for testifying against the other suspects, <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, 28, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, 45. <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON> was placed on probation for 25 years and ordered not to leave <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> were sentenced to three consecutive life terms in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> state prison. <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON> fled <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in violation of his probation and came to the <LOCATION> Gloversville </LOCATION> area, about 40 miles west of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, where his ex-girlfriend lives, authorities said. <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> police arrested <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON> in June on a criminal impersonation charge when he falsely identified himself after being stopped for a traffic violation, said <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sheriff </LOCATION>'s Lt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Emery </PERSON> <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON> was jailed after authorities learned he had violated his <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> probation. But after the maximum 90 days he had to be released Sept. 25 because <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> authorities did not try to extradite him, said <PERSON> Sheriff </PERSON>'s Sgt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. Without an extradition request, there is nothing <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> officials can do to ship <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON> back to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tomlinson </LOCATION>. `` Yes, he is violating his probation, and if he ever shows up in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> we will arrest him,'' <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> Recorder. `` But are there plans to extradite him? No.'' <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON> poses no danger, and if he had not testified `` these two other characters, who should have been given the electric chair, would be roaming the streets,'' <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON>'s ex-girlfriend, who spoke on condition she not be identified, claims <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON> has threatened her several times since his release. She said she has told local authorities about the threats. <ORGANIZATION> Gloversville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gancarz </PERSON> said he had not heard about the threats.

<HEAD>Parents Settle Over Daughter's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parents of a 4-year-old who died after a swimming lesson described as strenuous have settled a lawsuit against instructors and a beach resort for nearly $ 1 million. `` We still ca n't believe it happened,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, who watched at poolside while instructors huddled over her daughter, Amber <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, after she lost consciousness during a 50-yard swim. Amber was taking a swimming lesson in August 1987 from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Symons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatton </PERSON> at the Tides Hotel and Bath Club Resort in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Redington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. According to the lawsuit, <PERSON> Hatton </PERSON> made her swim two laps in the 75-foot pool. During the second lap the child, who had tearfully complained of fatigue, lost consciousness and stopped breathing with an instructor only a couple feet from her. The mother of another child in the class and an instruction performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics arrived, but Amber never breathed on her own again and was placed on life support equipment. She was removed from the equipment eight days later and died. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> filed suit against the instructors and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, which owns the resort, alleging negligence. They settled Monday for $ 950,000. The couple said they will wage a personal campaign for state and national laws requiring instructors and lifeguards be certified in lifesaving skills and CPR. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, attorney for the resort and the instructors, said the instructors were certified in lifesaving and CPR, more qualified than was required by either <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Swimming, a sanctioning association, or <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law. The last thing Mrs. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> remembers is Amber asking: `` Mommy, how much longer is class? I do n't want to swim the long way.'' `` I'll always have a problem with that,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, 32, said through tears. Family attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said the couple decided to settle rather than take the matter to court this week because of the stress a trial would bring. `` They would have been reliving this thing 1,000 times.'' <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said the hotel is looking at the swim program to see if changes need to be made. Hotel management `` wanted to get all this over and done with first,'' he said. <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> denied there were serious flaws with the program. `` If it were so deficient, how did it function for 35 years,'' teaching 8,000 to 10,000 swimmers in three generations, without another death, he asked.

<TEXT>
 A commission of business, union and political leaders announced on Tuesday plans to study ways to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers more competitive with those in other industrialized countries. The 34-member Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce will be chaired by <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Magaziner </PERSON>, an international business authority, co-chaired by former <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secretaries </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, and will include <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> and the chief executives of <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Corning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The commission will study job skill development programs in seven countries: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Magaziner </PERSON>, the commission's final report, expected next spring, will: _ Urge changes in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secondary schools to ensure youngsters graduate with job skills, _ Call for a `` second chance system'' for those out of high school and out of work, and _ Urge creation of a system to update skills of existing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is in a race with time. From <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, those nations that are winning the economic war have made the development and effective use of very highly skilled work forces an indispensible part of their strategy,'' said <PERSON> Magaziner </PERSON>. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> knows it is far behind in the schooling process, but it has hardly begun to think about an equally pressing problem _ how to raise the skills of line workers already in the workforce,'' he said. Research is expected to take seven months, <PERSON> Magaziner </PERSON> said. The project will consist of more than 2,000 interviews with plant executives, employees and policymakers in those seven nations. It is being funded by a $ 250,000 grant from <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The commission is an initiative of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and the Economy, in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, an organization founded in 1987 as an outgrowth of `` A Nation Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Century,'' a landmark Carnegie report widely credited with shifting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> school reform toward empowering teachers and restructuring schools. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, author of that report, is president of the Rochester-based center.

 East Germans were left blood-spattered and some even unconscious Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> as nearly 300 of the most desperate fought police, broke through barricades and scaled a fence in their bid for freedom. `` This is pandemonium,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> assistant handling injured refugees on the embassy grounds. Early Tuesday, officials closed the embassy, leaving nearly 1,000 people stranded outside the baroque <PERSON> Lobkowicz </PERSON> Palace that houses it. Between 4,000 and 5,000 people, including some 1,500 children, were packed into the compound at the time, and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials feared sanitation problems. Shortly after noon, the desperation peaked. Witnesses saw groups of newcomers rush toward the fence of the compound, which was blocked by a police barricade. When police tried to stop them, the refugees pulled down the barricade. Police resorted to their truncheons. `` They clubbed like mad,'' a Czechoslovak eyewitness reported. More people from the waiting crowd surged toward where the beatings took place. In only minutes, almost 300 thronged the narrow passage toward a six-foot fence into the embassy garden. Police beat them as they passed, and many reached the fence bleeding. Those who broke through scaled the fence. Refugees quickly built `` a human ladder'' to help many clear the hurdle, the witnesses said. Many got caught on the sharp spikes at the top of the fence and others jumped or fell head-first to the ground. Some were later seen lying unconscious inside the compound, the witnesses said. Outside the embassy, families with small children were unable to get inside. They said they feared police retaliation. Later, when the situation had calmed down somewhat, young men were still seen climbing the embassy facade from a truck. They were pulled in through windows by other refugees.

<HEAD>After Accident, Dog Makes Recovery _ on Two Legs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STUART, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A dog can get around on three legs, but <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> is a 40-pound dog with two legs who has learned to do practically everything normal dogs do. `` He might be a step or two slower than he was with four legs but not much more than that,'' said owner <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` He's quick enough that I'm back to using him with the cattle. He can run around them and get them moving just like he used to.'' <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> learned to run on his two right legs after a hay mower accident July 1 nearly killed the animal and left his left legs dangling as useless stubs. The stubs swing back and forth when he moves, but they do n't touch the ground. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is amazed, as are visitors to his farm. `` Come to think of it, the only thing he ca n't do that he could before is jump a fence,'' he said. `` When it happened, I'd been out mowing the end rows of my oat field and I was coming back in,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` I came around the corner of the hog house and there was <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON>. It happened so quick I could n't get stopped in time. The mower went right over it. `` He was just motionless there underneath it, bleeding but still alive. I'll tell you, it was like running over your own kid. Well, almost. It about made me sick.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 35, raced to the office of veterinarian Dr. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Christianson </PERSON>, who agrees the recovery was remarkable. `` Yeah, it is amazing. It's not like we have physical therapy in veterinary medicine. But just the fact that he survived is something, considering how bad he was hurt.'' <PERSON> Christianson </PERSON> said the dog had lost a lot of blood by the time <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> brought him in `` and it was a close call whether were going to try to save him or put him to sleep. We decided to give it a try and if it did n't work, or if the dog was n't having much of a life afterward because of just having two legs, we could put him to sleep later.'' The veterinarian said the dog survived the accident because the 3-year-old red heeler was in good shape at the time. `` But the biggest factor is that this dog has a real will to live, a heck of a lot of character. Most animals would have given up,'' <PERSON> Christianson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Maverick District Topples Texas School Funding System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLEY SHANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In hot, dimly lit classrooms, students in the <LOCATION> Edgewood </LOCATION> Independent School District have learned what it means to struggle. Most come from poor families in the predominantly Hispanic southwest section of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. At school, in buildings in need of extensive renovation, they have had few specialized classes and fewer sports programs. But their dropout rate is low. Their superintendent is recognized by educators statewide. And pride pervades. This is where the battle began to topple <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' public school finance system, to gain financial equality between rich and poor districts, and where students, educators, lawyers and legislators rejoiced Monday over the unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling declaring the finance system unconstitutional. The court gave the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> until May 1 to come up with a solution. `` When we first began the lawsuit, nobody wanted to join with us. We were sort of the Lone Ranger,'' Edgewood Superintendent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> said Tuesday. But that had never bothered this maverick district. In 1968 <LOCATION> Edgewood </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> Demetrio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> led a group of parents and students in suing for equality between rich and poor school districts. That lawsuit ended in 1973 when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned a three-judge federal panel that had ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to devise a constitutional funding system. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and others remained involved in the battle, and in 1984, with the help of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Educational Fund, the district began the winning legal war with the state. While the school district had its doubts, <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> said, it never considered abandoning the fight. That same determination has pushed the district during its 84-year history, he said. `` We've got to fight for everything we get. I think that spirit moves us forward,'' said <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, who has been with <ORGANIZATION> Edgewood </ORGANIZATION> 30 years as a teacher, vice principal, principal, assistant superintendent and now superintendent. The 15,500-student district is 95 percent Hispanic and covers a section of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> with 87,000 residents, many of whom are poor or work at one of several nearby military bases, school board president <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> said. Part of the district's problem has been that its property base, used to determine taxation, is mostly low-income housing or military installations. Though the federal government pays the district about $ 200,000 a year, the bases can not be taxed. The lack of money means <LOCATION> Edgewood </LOCATION> spends about $ 3,600 per pupil per year. Other <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> school districts spend anywhere from $ 2,100 to $ 19,300 per pupil, depending on the district's tax base. Compounding the problem, <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> contends, is the higher concentration in low-income districts of students with special needs, meaning more money must be spent on them and even less channeled toward so-called `` mainstream'' students. The school district's priorities, <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> said, are implementing innovative programs to curtail the dropout rate, paying teachers competitive salaries and renovating buildings. Some of the buildings need complete refurbishing and many do n't have air conditioning, which <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> considers a necessity in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, where Monday's temperature reached 95 degrees <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> is proud of the school district's relatively low dropout rate. At 23 percent, it compares favorably with the approximate 50 percent average statewide for Hispanic youths. Former <LOCATION> Edgewood </LOCATION> students typically stay involved with the district and offer help once they are established in their careers, <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> said. `` They've lived the experience, they know what it's like out there, and they want to come back and make things better,'' the superintendent said. `` It's like a family.'' <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> has had numerous offers to go elsewhere. He has lectured on school financing at most major <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> universities, served on state education task forces and is co-founder of the Austin-based <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which includes more than 200 school districts and has its own budget and staff to study school financing. He sees the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling not only as a victory for his students but for all <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> children. <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> spent much of Monday explaining to his students that they were part of history. But, he said, he is still trying to make himself believe it. `` I think that will sink into me one of these days,'' he said.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Powerful Drug, Program to Check for Side Effects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government Tuesday approved a new drug to treat severe schizophrenia and a unique monitoring program in which patients using the drug will be tested weekly for signs of a potentially fatal side effect. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said the drug, clozapine, can be used only for patients who have not responded to at least two regimens of standard, less toxic therapy. An estimated 200,000 people could benefit from the drug, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The drug has been shown to relieve the symptoms of severe schizophrenia, allowing patients to lead more productive lives. But the drug also can cause a potentially fatal blood disorder called agranulocytosis, in which the level of infection-fighting white blood cells is reduced. Studies have shown the condition can be reversed if caught early. Under the monitoring system, a home health care company will distribute the prescribed medication to patients each week and collect blood samples that will be sent to a national laboratory for analysis, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. If the test results indicate the patient must stop taking the drug, the patient's doctor will be notified immediately by telephone. The testing program was proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Sandoz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, which will market the drug under the trade name Clozaril. It is believed to be the first time the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has approved such a testing plan along with a new drug, an agency spokeswoman said. Agranulocytosis occurs in 1 percent to 2 percent of patients taking clozapine, said <ORGANIZATION> Sandoz </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>. In each of the 15 cases of the blood disorder that occurred during testing, the side effect was caught early enough for the condition to be reversed. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said, however, that `` even with the careful monitoring system planned, some fraction of patients who develop agranulocytosis may die.'' The drug is also associated with seizures. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> acknowledged the serious risks associated with use of the drug, but said, `` The severity and hopelessness of unremitting chronic schizophrenia was an important factor in the decision to approve clozapine.'' Schizophrenia can be incapacitating without effective treatment, often leaving the patient incoherent, plagued by continual fear and threatening hallucinations, and unable to care for themselves. Clozapine was first evaluated in the early 1960s by <ORGANIZATION> Sandoz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Basel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, and marketed in several foreign countries. But its development as an antipsychotic drug in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was abandoned and the drug was taken off the market in other countries in the mid-1970s when it was linked to agranulocytosis with several deaths in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pool Closed after Lifeguards Fall Ill with Rare Respiratory Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTMINSTER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal health officials will test water from a city pool closed Tuesday in a search for the cause of a rare respiratory problem diagnosed in four lifeguards. `` I have my fingers and toes crossed that maybe this will give us the answers we're looking for,'' said <PERSON> Pierrette </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, the city's risk-management officer Two lifeguards were diagnosed last month and two were diagnosed last week with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a rare allergic reaction to prolonged exposure to various organic dusts and chemicals. `` They're sick in that they feel tired all the time, just like if you have a real bad case of the flu,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said. The four lifeguards also have runny noses and runny eyes. Three were assigned other city jobs and one quit to return to school. `` In my mind there's no doubt there's a problem with the pool. But we do n't know what it is,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Cecile </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> of the National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. She diagnosed three of the four cases. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> will test water samples shipped them Monday for a small protozoa called acanthamoeba, which has been associated with the disease, said <PERSON> Govinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Visvesvara </PERSON>, research biologist with the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s division of parasitic diseases. Some types of the protozoa are resistant to chlorine. Water and air tests so far have turned up no cause for the illnesses. Results of the additional tests were expected in two to three weeks. The indoor pool was closed pending the additional test results and to avoid any harm to the pool's 19 other lifeguards, who will be tested, Ms. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Legislators Rebuff Gorbachev Call for Total Ban on Strikes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suffered his first major policy defeat in the 4-month-old Soviet legislature Tuesday when it rejected his call for an emergency ban on workers' newly won right to strike. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told lawmakers he was satsified with a compromise that imposes a selective ban on strikes in critical industries. He said it would `` help restore a normal life.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Monday he wanted a ban on all strikes for the next 15 months to prevent anarchy from overwhelming the shaky Soviet economy. A wave of strikes, largely over ethnic and political conflicts, cost the country $ 6.5 billion in July and August alone. Strikes were ruthlessly suppressed for decades until <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began his effort to turn the country from a dictatorship into one ruled by law. It was only last year that workers began to succeed in pressuring for change by walking off the job. It was the first time the new Supreme Soviet legislature stood up to the government and opted for its own policy, though it had previously rejected several Cabinet nominees. The legislature's display of independence was particularly significant because it came on a package of emergency measures The compromise resolution, adopted by a vote of 364-6, prohibits strikes in the transport, energy, raw materials and metallurgy industries, but only until the legislature passes a detailed law defining the right to strike. That could be as soon as Monday, at the next session of the full legislature. Nearly half the articles in the strike law were approved Tuesday. The more controversial sections, which have yet to face floor debate, would ban strikes that threaten human life or health, as well as any aimed at overthrow of the government or violation of ethnic equality. It also would ban strikes in the transportation, communications, energy and defense industries, and among civil servants. The draft also requires arbitration before a strike and allows the Supreme Soviet or its ruling Presidium to halt or delay strikes. It also says those found responsible for a strike can be fired and fined up to three months' pay to help cover economic damages. It does not define responsibility, leaving open the possibility that managers who fail to resolve labor disputes could be held as guilty as strike leaders. All of these points still await debate. The emergency resolution adopted also permits the country's ministries of interior, defense and transport to guarantee operation of the railroads in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> if necessary to get rail traffic moving again to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> Strikers in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> motivated by ethnic demands created a virtual economic blockade of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> by interfering with shipments on the main rail and road lines to the neighboring republic. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> are locked in a conflict over the disputed territory of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which has also been hit by lengthy strikes. Trains ship about 80 percent of the goods <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> receives from elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In July, thousands of coal miners walked off the job demanding more consumer goods and control over mining operations. They returned to work only after <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> agreed to a package of economic and social improvements that officials say will cost about $ 3 billion. Legislators from four committees who worked through the night on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal to ban strikes originally offered him a complete rebuff. Their weakened draft resolution, presented to the Supreme Soviet Tuesday morning, did not even mention any ban on strikes. During the debate, a deputy suggested prohibiting strikes only in key industries. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> responded by repeating his warning that the Soviet economy is threatened by waves of politically motivated job actions. But he did not call again for an outright ban on all strikes. Interior Minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> told reporters the blanket ban was rejected by the legislative group as unconstitutional. `` We do n't have a basis for deciding what is an extraordinary situation,'' he said. <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON>, a deputy premier in charge of economic reform, confirmed that a dramatically different draft resolution came during the overnight meeting of deputies and not from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Speaking to reporters during a break in debate, he made it clear that <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leaders believe strong action is needed, and criticized the deputies for caving into public pressure. `` Everyone wants to be sympathetic, wants the public to like them, and nobody wants to take the responsibility,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> received support from a number of liberals. <PERSON> Marju </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauristin </PERSON>, a deputy and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said during a break she favored limits on strikes over political issues because they damage the economy and could be used as an excuse for military intervention. Russian workers in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> went on strike during the summer to protest voting laws they say favor the majority Estonians.

<TEXT>
 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was invited to address a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats announced an ambitious effort to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> make the leap from communism to democracy. Democratic leaders of both chambers dismissed President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 219 million package of initiatives in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as a `` grossly inadequate'' response to an historic opportunity to bolster democracy and free enterprise in the region and to end the 40-year Cold War with victory for the West They spelled out a legislative program _ with a potential total value of more than $ 3.7 billion _ composed of loans from international financial institutions, direct American aid and loans and a five-year halt in Polish payments on its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank debt. `` Bold action today will be far less costly than timidity,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>. `` For if we hesitate, and the opportunity is lost, we will be paying for it for a long, long time _ in an escalating arms race ...'' Escalating the partisan attack on Republican inititives for <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said it is ironic that a government which doubled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spending to respond to a Soviet military threat, `` now seems curiously paralyzed, unable to respond to the possibility of economic freedom, democracy and peace breaking out in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> ...'' But <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON>, assistant secretary of State for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> affairs, denying such paralysis exists, said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new plan for restructuring its centralized economy is `` in many respects a declaration of economic independence.'' <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> that a Polish request for a $ 1 billion loan to stabilize the economy is `` under very active review at very high levels. There will be a response to that shortly.'''' The invitation to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to address a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 15 was extended by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who had already announced plans to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is expected to accept. Both Democratic leaders compared the proposal to the aid announced so far by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> calling the president's `` woefully inadequate. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> program is grossly inadequate,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich. `` We intend to provide the leadership that has been lacking up to now. The Democratic aid package includes $ 887 million in new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and food assistance to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, of which it is contemplated that $ 415 million would be appropriated for use in the 1990 fiscal year which opened on Sunday. This would include some $ 125 million in immediate food aid. The plan builds on and expands the private-sector Enterprise Fund proposed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during his visit to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> last summer. It would help fund a host of small-scale projects, encourage joint commercial ventures with Western corporations, and work to establish private businesses in the two countries. The Democratic aid plan includes trade credit insurance, health programs, scholarships and scientific and labor exchanges. It calls for a coordinated aid effort by the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export-Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. It calls for the use of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Exchange Stabilization Fund to make available up to $ 1 billion in loans to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` Our package will instruct the secretary to use that fund for bridge loans to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which they can use to repay debts, buy the materials necessary for industrial restructuring, and jump start their economy,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. The plan would also give <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> breathing space by halting, for five years, payments on its $ 2.5 billion debt to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lending institutions. Another element of the proposal would instruct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to seek $ 1.4 billion in bridge loans for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Medical Journal Tightens Ethics Standards for Researchers</HEAD>

 Spurred by concerns about scientific misconduct, a prestigious medical journal will require study authors to hand over their raw data for examination if requested, the journal editor said Tuesday. The journal also will tighten its requirement on disclosing financial interests involved in the research, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> of the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The steps are among requirements being imposed to protect the credibility of the journal, <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. The requirements will take effect when they are announced in next week's issue, he said at a science reporters conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're calling attention to all these things, hoping by education or intimidation to keep things straight,'' he said in an interview. To get research published in the journal, scientists will have to sign a pledge that they will let editors examine their raw data if the editors ask for it, <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. That will help in detecting misrepresentation of data or fraud, he said. The journal already asks authors to disclose financial interests in their work, and `` we've trusted authors to level with us,'' <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. The journal will go a step further by requiring a signed certification. Financial interests include who paid for the research, who employs the researchers, whether a researcher owns stock in a company that would be affected by the study and whether the scientist is a paid consultant to such a company. Such information may be published along with the study, <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. Study authors also will have to certify that they participated in the reported work enough to take public responsibility for it. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said that is aimed at the practice of `` honorary authorship,'' in which a listed author may not have played a meaningful role in the study. In some recent medical fraud cases, distinguished scientists who were listed as authors had never seen the paper and did not even know the reported research was bogus, he said. But the appearance of their names on the papers lent the works credence, he said. Authors also will have to vouch for the validity of the study and certify that they had reviewed and approved the final manuscript. If an author lies in making the newly required statements, the journal may publish a notice about it, <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. In a separate presentation at the conference, a prominent heart disease researcher said federal funding for biomedical research should be set as a fixed fraction of the nation's spending on health care. Without such steps to assure adequate funding in the future, the field will have trouble attracting young researchers and replacing antiquated equipment, said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotto </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. That in turn would endanger its ability to conduct the science that leads to new products for health care, he said. In 1985, the nation spent $ 458 billion, or about 10.8 percent of its gross national product, on health care costs, he said. Federal funding of medical research has declined to about 1.2 percent of overall GNP from previous levels of 3 percent, he said. A return to the previous level might be an appropriate target, he said. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, associate vice president for medical research of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed the fixed-percentage idea is `` not very realistic politically.'' It would convert research funding to an entitlement like <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would probably be reluctant to do that, he said in an interview.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration urged <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Tuesday to work out an agreement with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> permitting the emigration of thousands of additional refugees who have flocked to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s embassies in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. But the best solution, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said, would be for the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to establish permament procedures for people to travel `` without hindrance from their government.'' Under an agreement between the two Germanys, more than 6,000 East Germans were admitted to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over the weekend. Afterward, thousands of additional would-be emigrants went to the West German embassies in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> trying to follow their countrymen. However, the East German government said the agreement was a one-time humanitarian arrangement and demanded that <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> not allow the second influx to stay in its embassies. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, through <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, came down Tuesday on the side of the refugees by invoking the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> agreement, a 35-nation accord that pledged a freer flow of people and ideas between East and West. Having signed the accord, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said, the East German government is `` responsible to meet that commitment.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official also praised <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for providing a home for fellow Germans. But the statement read by <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> also suggested that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, one of the strictest Communist states in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, could help keep its people from leaving by undertaking reforms. `` We believe that in order to remove the conditions which caused so many people to flee to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, the GDR -LRB- <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> -RRB- leadership should institute reforms which will lead to a political and economic system responsive to the population of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. He said the `` root cause'' of the situation was that people do not want to live in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` If you're going to have a way of resolving the situation in the long run, there are going to have to be political and economic reforms in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that will make it a more livable place for people.'' Still, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official stressed the view that East Germans under the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> agreement have a right to go to the West. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the agreement specified `` a very clear freedom to travel and freedom of emigration.'' On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, meanwhile, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> G.H </PERSON>. <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> reaffirmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the eventual reunification of East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but said that reunification must be approached cautiously. `` It is correct that the history of the 20th century is a history in which the unification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> led to instability and to war. History tells us to be very cautious,'' <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> said at a congressional hearing.

 A federal prosecutor said Tuesday he was ready and waiting to put Panamanian military ruler Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on trial on drug trafficking charges if a coup attempt resulted in his extradition. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was accused in a February 1988 indictment here of accepting $ 4.6 million from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel to provide protection and services for traffickers smuggling cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He also faces a three-count marijuana-trafficking indictment in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. `` I am ready to try him as soon as his defense lawyers are ready,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s attorney in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>, said he had no comment on Tuesday's events in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where soldiers opposed to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> seized his headquarters. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration once offered to drop the indictment if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but that deal fell through. Now, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said, `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is interested in trying <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and the major case against him is in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.'' Other federal law enforcement officials said that without a formal extradition order, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might not be sent to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> initially, but could be detained at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases. A formal extradition treaty exists between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but it is not obligatory for either nation. The 12-count indictment against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, upheld by a federal judge in January, also includes charges against <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel leader <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>. The indictment alleges that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> protected drug shipments through <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, arranged for cocaine-processing chemicals, allowed traffickers to set up a processing laboratory in his country, and laundered cartel profits through Panamanian banks. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> also allegedly sheltered some of the cartel leaders after the assassination of Colombian Minister of Justice <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara-Bonilla </PERSON>, according to the indictment. But at one point, the indictment said, he raided the cartel laboratory, and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> allegedly mediated the resulting dispute between <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the cartel. The <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> indictment accuses <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of accepting $ 1 million to allow the importation of 1.4 million pounds of marijuana. No one has been tried under either indictment.

 <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government and the U.S.-armed rebels opposing it are waging their battle in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s public relations arena this week. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is holding open house for both sides, scheduling meetings with Angolan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON> _ despite the absence of diplomatic relations with his government _ and a White House visit with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, leader of the Angolan rebels. In addition, at the administration's urging Zairean President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> is paying a quick visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday and will meet with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House, officials said. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the main agenda item would be <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and the strains between <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, who has helped funnel <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, appears to have shifted his allegiance in recent weeks, openly supporting Angolan President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic efforts are designed to head off a final collapse of Zairean-mediated truce accords reached last June between <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, one of the largest recipients of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> covert aid, and the Soviet-backed government. The truce began coming apart soon after it went into effect, and subsequent negotiations between the sides on a permanent agreement ending their 14-year civil war have failed despite persistent State Department efforts. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> is demanding free elections and a change in the country's Marxist-oriented constitution <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, meanwhile, denies claims by <PERSON> Dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> that he agreed to go into exile and to integrate his troops into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s army. He says such contentions are a ruse to destroy <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> politically after the government failed to do so militarily. The two sides have refused to sit in the same room during negotiations. In an interview after his arrival here, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said he was prepared to meet with a high-level <ORGANIZATION> Angolan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> delegation, which is due to arrive Wednesday. He also is urging a more active <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in the negotiations with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, similar to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> diplomacy last year that helped bring about the complex agreement for the pullout of 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and the granting of independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, who received his guerrilla training in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and until last year got most of his military support from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, is aided by a powerful array of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lobbyists and lawyers, led by the firm of <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, Stone and <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. His nearly week-long agenda is packed with meetings on Capitol Hill, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, as well as with reporters and with businessmen seeking a foothold in mineral-rich <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> government's foreign minister, is coming to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for only one day, and his lobbyists and supporters have organized meetings with <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials and reporters to press for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recognition of his government. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is the only Western country which still does n't recognize <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> TransAfrica </ORGANIZATION> which is lobbying for recognition of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. In another salvo between the sides, <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> supporters led by Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, have asked Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to investigate <ORGANIZATION> TransAfrica </ORGANIZATION>, accusing it of violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act by accepting more than $ 2,000 from the Angolan mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` I certainly never received any money from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON>'s side-trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is viewed by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials as an attempt to counter the effects of <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s visit. A kit distributed by <ORGANIZATION> Fenton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, the firm that handles <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s public relations, includes a list of demonstrations planned this week against <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> as well as copies of recent newspaper articles critical of the rebel leader. Half-page ads this week in The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, paid for by the Angolan government, said <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> was coming here to press for more covert aid to augment the $ 40 million <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> is already getting. The ads cited an article in The National Review which described <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> as having `` a classic Marxist-Leninist structure with not a vestige of democratic procedures.'' A resolution introduced last week by 42 Democrats and 15 Republicans in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> calls on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to establish a liaison office in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>. But the administration, backed by conservatives such as Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, has rejected granting any diplomatic ties until the government agrees to hold free elections that would give <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> a shot at power-sharing.

 Volunteers have offered to fly a terminally ill <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employee home to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> refused a request from the man's family for a free air-ambulance flight. But the health of the employee, <PERSON> Avram </PERSON> <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>, had declined as of Tuesday to the point where it may be too late for him to make a transcontinental flight, his wife said. <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>, 25, was diagnosed last year with terminal brain cancer. The three-year <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> computer operator who lives in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, about 45 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, sought a free air-ambulance flight to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. It would have cost roughly $ 29,000 to hire a private air ambulance. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> said her husband wanted to return to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> where he was born and raised so he could be among relatives and friends for the last weeks of his life. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials refused, even when congressmen and a White House aide were enlisted to help <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>. After the matter received publicity last week, several volunteers offered to provide <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>'s flight home `` We had a lot of very wonderful people call giving us offers to travel,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> said. `` But they just do n't feel he can travel any more.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> said she contacted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., Tuesday and told a staff member that she was no longer requesting <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> help The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> failed to meet criteria for a free ride courtesy of the government on several counts: he is not a uniformed officer; the flight would have no impact on his chances of survival; and his illness was not caused by his <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> work. `` We knew going in that this was unlikely to have a happy ending,'' said <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, a client advocate for the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Handicapped </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, who has been working on the <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> case. <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> received several offers for free flights, <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> man who read about <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>'s plight contacted a state representative from <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Norwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and offered to fly <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> home. A California-based company also offered a free flight while a Virginia-based medical airlift service was contacted about raising funds for a flight. Mrs. <PERSON> Brody </PERSON>, 26, said she did not know if her husband's condition might improve enough to make a flight possible. <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> has already outlasted the life expectation given by doctors by several months. `` We had a lot of good Samaritans calling and it's nice to know that there are these kind of people in the world,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> said.

 A nationwide credit company agreed Tuesday to pay $ 275,000 in civil penalties in the largest settlement ever obtained by the federal government under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had charged the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> discriminated against applicants to its `` instant credit'' program on the basis of age, sex, marital status and receipt of income from public assistance.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought 2 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, the first for delivery in the just-begun marketing year under a long-term supply agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Rumors had been circulating in the grain trade that the Soviets were in the market for a large order of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn. The seventh year of the long-term agreement between the two countries began on Oct. 1. Officials said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain sales to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1988-89, the sixth year of the agreement, were a record of more than 21.7 million tons, including more than 16.3 million tons of corn and nearly 5.4 million tons of wheat. In addition, 1988-89 sales included 442,500 tons of soybeans, 1.35 million tons of soybean meal, and 1.02 million tons of grain sorghums. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 2 million tons of corn would be about 78.8 million bushels. The sales were made by unidentified private exporting companies, who are required by law to report large sales to the department. No selling prices or further details were released. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.22 per bushel at the farm level, according to the department's five-day average, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $ 175 million. The agreement was extended last year until Dec. 31, 1990. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are preparing to begin preliminary talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Dec. 4 for a new long-term agreement to succeed the current pact. Under the current agreement, the Soviets are committed to buy at least 9 million tons of grain annually, including a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn, and 1 million tons which can be wheat, corn, soybeans and soybean meal, or any combination of those. The pact also allows <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to buy up to 3 million tons of additional wheat and corn annually without further discussions. If more than 12 million tons are wanted, however, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must be consulted.

 A Chinese man who was arrested after requesting political asylum in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> was allowed to leave for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Tuesday night, officials reported. A government spokesman said <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, 20, was released under a discretionary section of the immigration code. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> sought political asylum in the British colony after his tourist visa expired in August. He said he had joined pro-democracy marches in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and feared authorities would jail him if he returned to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He got no response from the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government, and immigration officials arrested him Sept. 23 because his visa had expired. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the American consulate received <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>'s application and supporting documents Tuesday and granted him a non-immigrant visa of limited duration.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> easily approved President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination of a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> businessman to be ambassador to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> on Tuesday, but some Democrats used the occasion to accuse <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of abusing diplomatic posts as political rewards The businessman, 55-year-old <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Zappala </PERSON>, is one of several <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appointees who have become lightning rods for accusations that the administration is handing out ambassadorships to wealthy but unqualified campaign contributors. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmed him on a 79-20 vote. <PERSON> Zappala </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, real estate developer, is not college educated, has no foreign service experience and does not speak Spanish. He received an `` unqualified'' rating from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diplomacy </ORGANIZATION>, a respected body which evaluates ambassadorial nominees. But Democrats are quick to point out that he also gave a reported $ 126,000 to Republican campaigns in recent years and actively raised money for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1988 presidential bid. The nominee has shown `` no interest in the people, politics or history of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, D-R.I. `` I am forced to conclude that the main reason for Mr. <PERSON> Zappala </PERSON>'s nomination was his fund raising ... and contributions.'' Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, D-Md., a member of the Foreign Relations panel, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has appointed `` an unusual number'' of such people to head embassies around the world He said of 58 ambassadorial nominations <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for confirmation, 22 have been career foreign service officers and 36 have been political appointees. `` To the world at large, this says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not serious about diplomacy,'' <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> said during debate on the nomination Monday. `` No other major industrial nation appoints its nominees in this way.'' In the case of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> noted, democracy is relatively new, dating from the death of dictator <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> in 1975. Recognizing the sensitivity of the position, presidents since then have appointed only professional diplomats as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassadors to <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, he said. But Sen. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn., defended the nominee, saying his background `` is far broader than that of many senators. <PERSON> Zappala </PERSON>'s resume shows he has been an active <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fund-raiser and headed local charity and drug-rehabilitation organizations. `` He is a businessman ... who has branched out far beyond the community where he began,'' <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> said. And Sen. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., argued that foreign governments often are glad to host an ambassador who, while not a foreign-policy expert, is a close friend of the president `` There are some indications that the government of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is pleased to have that kind of direct connection,'' he said. <PERSON> Zappala </PERSON> barely survived the confirmation process in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which voted 10-9 to send his name to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. An exasperated <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> then termed <PERSON> Zappala </PERSON> a `` political throwaway'' and said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might as well put the diplomatic posts up for public auction and use the money to defray the public debt.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in its first review of the two-month-old savings and loan bailout, is scrutinizing ethics rules written for the agency created to sell failed institutions. The <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, created Aug. 9 when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the bailout legislation, has gotten off to a fast start, closing 24 small institutions of the 275 insolvent thrifts under its control in 33 states. The agency is reviewing bids on five large institutions, all with $ 1 billion or more in assets, and hopes to dispose of them by the end of next week. But members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> banking committees, meeting Wednesday, will be probing to see if the fast start is creating growing pains and whether the agency is establishing procedures to prevent another HUD-type scandal. `` We want to be very sure there are safeguards in place against any kind of special interest activity that would use the side door, the back door, special relationships, etc.,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich. and the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> last week issued an interim ethics code governing the thousands of independent contractors it is expected to hire to manage the real estate and other assets it is inheriting from the thrifts. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, the agency's executive director, said the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> is trying to prevent improprieties but at the same time avoid defining conflict of interest so broadly that it is difficult to hire advisers and property managers. `` It's difficult,'' <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` Many of the really big acknowledged experts have potential conflicts. We need advice on how to sell real estate and the same contractors that would provide us advice ... are probably advising somebody else who may be interested in buying that real estate.'' The code prohibits contractors from self-dealing, favortism and conflicts of interest and sets up an agency board to rule on cases that are n't black and white In another safeguard, the management of the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> is split in a unique arrangement designed to prevent abuse. Policies are formulated by a Cabinet-level board headed by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. But the actual operations are being carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the independent agency insuring bank and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L deposits, through a staff headed by <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>. In the first few weeks of the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>'s existence, that structure led to public squabbling between the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> and the adminstration oversight board. <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> said the tension was easing, but members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are still concerned. `` The one thing that's troubled me so far is the fighting between -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and the -LRB- oversight -RRB- board. ... Is that really resolved permanently or is it just quiescent?'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> task force appointed to oversee the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> said, `` I think we're working that out. ... On day one, there's a certain amount of tension because they may be thinking one thing and we're thinking something entirely different. Time is making that better.'' In its first two months of existence, the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> has spent $ 20 billion: $ 1.8 billion to close the 24 small <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls; $ 8.3 billion to handle the five large institutions and several other not-yet-completed deals; $ 8.5 billion to replace high-cost deposits; and $ 1.4 billion as a reserve fund to handle liquidity problems at failed, but still open, thrifts, spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Katsanos </PERSON> said Tuesday.

 Tens of thousands of people have begun arriving in the capital to petition <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to lift the homeless from the streets and make housing more affordable for all Americans.

But the breadth of their sponsorship, coupled with a massive planning effort dating to early in the year, could produce one of the largest demonstrations <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has seen in years. `` We're saying enough is enough,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> homeless activist <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>. `` Today the streets in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> look like those in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>. This demonstration is to provide some will and some backbone to the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The march and related events, including a lobbying siege of individual members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by an estimated 4,000 people on Thursday and Friday, is backed by more than 200 organizations, including the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> YWCA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. More than 200 show business personalities and dozens of state and local officials, including Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, also have lent their support. The Hollywood contingent is led by actress <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> and actor <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Voight </PERSON>. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, head of the Community for Creative Non-Violence, and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zigas </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Low-Income </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, are among the principal organizers of the march. At a news conference Tuesday, <PERSON> Zigas </PERSON> repeatedly declined to predict a turnout, other than to say `` It's going to be a major, major event.'' He said more than half the participants would actually be homeless people, some of whom were walking from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. Huge caravans were en route, meanwhile, from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and other major cities along the way. `` Everybody who is not fabulously wealthy has reason to be here,'' said <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, who in the past has waged hunger strikes to draw attention to the plight of the homeless. `` We demand that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> put its hands back in its pockets and come up with the $ 25 billion it cut from the housing budget back in 1981.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bricklayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Craftsmen </ORGANIZATION>, said `` There has been a paralysis of leadership on both ends of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> on the housing problem. Housing for the homeless is the most obvious of concerns ... but ordinary people, working people, simply can not afford housing today.'' According to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>, there are an estimated 3 million homeless people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today. Though that figure has been repeatedly cited as gospel by march organizers and some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, it is widely disputed. The liberal <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, for example, said in 1988 that the homeless numbered no more than 600,000. Other estimates abound. A recent report by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affordable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said `` the number of persons likely to be homeless on a given night vary from 655,000 to 4 million,'' and it put the annual growth rate of homelessness and anywhere between 20 percent and 40 percent. Activists complain that the Reagan-Bush administrations cut the budget authority for federal housing assistance programs by 77 percent _ from $ 32 billion to less than $ 8 billion a year _ and cite that as the principal reason for the growing numbers of people who sleep in bus stations, abandoned cars, cardboard boxes or on heat grates. But the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> says that while budget authority _ the spending limit _ was lowered, actual spending increased almost 150 percent since 1978. Still, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s own figures indicate that at least 25 million Americans spend more than half their income on housing. Currently, one in four eligible poor renters actually receives federal help. Some conservatives, including former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, have argued that many of the homeless are mentally disturbed people who are on the streets, not for lack of government or private resources, but because of recent court decisions which prohibit them from being institutionalized against their will. But the <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> study says that `` Unlike the former stereotype of the Bowery Bum or the lone drifter, today's homeless are, substantially, functioning adults and families with children. They are a cross-section of our poverty population.'' According to the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, between 500,000 and 750,000 children in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are homeless. Though all participating organizations have vowed their activities will be peaceful, one of the more militant groups, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeless </ORGANIZATION>, has threatened to `` evict'' <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials from their offices on Friday unless restitution is made to the housing budget by those responsible for the department's mismanagement scandal NUH leader <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> declined to specify exactly what the group has in mind.

<HEAD>Experts Urge Congress to Accelerate Fusion Energy Project</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Leading experts on the potential for harnessing the energy that makes the sun and stars shine told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday the government should speed the pace of experiments that could produce a breakthrough in the next decade. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Furth </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plasma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel that government leadership for the magnetic fusion program was floundering just as scientists neared the most important experimental stage in 40 years of work. `` At the moment, there is no schedule'' for beginning the next key experiments, <PERSON> Furth </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, Space and Technology subcommittee on investigations. He said that while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the wherewithal to be a world leader in magnetic fusion research, `` we're suffering from some kind of psychological block'' that prevents the nation from making the necessary commitment. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has spent $ 5.5 billion in taxpayers' money over the last four decades in pursuit of magnetic fusion energy _ a self-sustaining reaction that releases energy when isotopes of hydrogen are heated to temperatures hotter than the sun's core and then fused. Magnetic fields are used to confine the isotopes. No one yet has proven the process to be commercially feasible, but many believe it could be the major source of electricity generation by the middle of the 21st century as the nation seeks to lessen its dependence on fossil fuels. The next big step in fusion research, the experts told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, Space and Technology subcommittee on investigations, is building a Compact Ignition Tokamak _ the world's first device capable of producing a fusion reaction in which enough heat is generated to sustain the reaction without further heating by the machine. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had proposed that construction of the Compact Ignition Tokamak start in 1992, but the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in recent months has indicated it wants to spend less on the machine and more on trying to determine beforehand whether it would work. It has not set an official timetable for construction. <PERSON> Furth </PERSON> and other experts said building the $ 400 million machine was vitally important to the program, even if the machine's success could not be assured in advance. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Overskei </PERSON>, senior vice president of the fusion division of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomics </ORGANIZATION>, told the panel that achieving a self-sustaining magnetic fusion reaction was possible in the 1990s and `` will put us on the threshold of fusion energy production.''

 Stressing that companies must help `` right the ship of education,'' the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> released a plan of action Tuesday to improve schools so students can be prepared for the workforce. NAB President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolberg </PERSON> said the Corporate Action Agenda is the first set of reports and action plans to be released since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with the nation's governors last week in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The goal is to provide immediate and direct answers to business people on how they must become involved now to initiate fundamental educational change. <PERSON> Kolberg </PERSON> added that key members of the alliance `` will be involved very much'' in helping to set the national performance goals recommended by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the governors at the summit. Alliance statistics showed that in 1950, only 57.4 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students graduated from high school, but those who failed to graduate could still find jobs and lead productive lives. Today, some 75 percent of the students graduate, but many are in no position to absorb education and training beyond the high school level. By 1995, it is estimated that some 14 million Americans will be unprepared for the jobs available, the Alliance said. The Corporate Action Agenda _ endorsed by Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> _ is comprised of four publications and a videotape. One of the publications, `` A Blueprint for Business on Restructuring Education,'' outlines five major ways of using the experience of business in restructuring <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools: school-based management, professionalism of teachers and administrators, curriculum and instruction, accountability and linking schools with social services. The action plans also provide in-depth information on new joint ventures and partnerships between businesses and school system, and details on establishing community-wide collaborative school-to-work transition programs. `` It is clear the business community has a major role to play in helping right the ship of education,'' said <PERSON> Kolberg </PERSON>, pointing to the numerous years businesses have been involved in helping schools with `` much of this effort focused on tinkering at the margin.'' <PERSON> Kolberg </PERSON> said there are 140,800 education partnerships nationwide, 57 percent sponsored by businesses or business organizations. Yet few of the partnerships have effected fundamental educational change, he said. `` Business must do more for our education system than simply paying for our athletic uniforms, speaking in a classroom, tutoring, offering plant tours or showing up for career days,'' said <PERSON> Kolberg </PERSON>. `` We are ready to work with others to make systemic changes in the education system, both at the national, state and local levels,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted Tuesday to cut off debate on long-stalled legislation that would require creation of a commission to investigate the lengthy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike. Senators voted narrowly to invoke cloture, getting 61 votes, just one more than necessary to limit debate. Thirty-six senators voted against ending the filibuster by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans. The Republicans had been backing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s refusal to appoint an emergency board, under provisions of the Railway Labor Act, to probe the strike, led by machinists, which began March 4. The action breaks a parliamentary jam holding up consideration of a measure mandating establishment of a three-person commission to study the work stoppage and make recommendations for its solution. There was no immediate indication when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would proceed to a vote on the bill. Under cloture rules, no senator may talk for more than an hour after debate has been cut off. This usually means there would be no more than 30 to 40 hours of further debate, since it takes 60 senators in the 100-member chamber to invoke cloture. Democrats had said last week that if they were successful in achieving a cutoff of debate, they would then substitute union-backed language for the House-passed bill, creating a commission with one member each appointed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. `` I think, in fairness, we should invoke cloture,'' Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, told colleagues before Tuesday's vote `` I believe that we owe nothing less to the workers of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>.'' Since March, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have used delaying tactics to block the chamber's consideration of House-passed legislation requiring <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint an emergency board. The president has refused to create a board, saying management and employees should resolve the problem. But <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said it was time to force <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s hand. `` It is now obvious that the president will not appoint an emergency board,'' he said. `` It is now obvious that unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> takes action, the president is content to do nothing ... while the families of 30,000 Eastern workers suffer.'' Five days after the machinists struck <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, joined by pilots and flight attendants, the carrier filed for protection under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Act. Eastern has been continuing efforts to reorganize in bankruptcy court and the airline has said it plans to emerge as a carrier two-thirds its former size.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, bogged down with other legislation, postponed for one day, until Wednesday, its likely vote to repeal catastrophic health insurance for the nation's elderly. Proponents of the program, enacted a year ago in a rush of bipartisan fervor, acknowledged Tuesday that the best they could hope for was to salvage a sliver of the new benefits, which marked the first major expansion of Medicare in two decades. Since the program began, legislators have been buffeted by criticism from elderly Americans upset about the cost of the insurance. The chamber had been expected to vote on repealing the program Tuesday, but scheduled debate on other legislation took so long that the vote was put off until Wednesday. Even if the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> votes to repeal the program, its fate wo n't be known until later in the fall, after negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to deal with the matter on its own later this week. At stake were significant new hospital and doctor-bill benefits for 33 million elderly and disabled Americans covered by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. Many of the benefits do not take effect until January. The cry for repeal came from three quarters: _ Retirees who complained their former employers were already giving them additional benefits they were being forced to purchase from Medicare _ Upper income retirees who objected to having to pay a disproportionate share of the costs _ in the form of an income tax surcharge _ to make up for a more modest assessment on the estimated 56 percent of Medicare beneficiaries who do n't have enough money to owe any income taxes _ Those who complained that the program did not address the main need of elderly Americans: insurance for nursing home and other long-term care, a benefit that many studies have said would be as much as 10 times as costly Ironically, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders said legislators' painful experience with this run at a major expansion of acute care health protection probably would make them less inclined to pursue even more costly programs for the elderly in the future. `` Future programs are going to have to be more carefully considered,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> told reporters shortly before debate was to have begun on the proposal to repeal catastrophic health insurance. Earlier, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> had described a `` mood of frustration'' as settling over <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> health policy leaders. Indeed, Rep. <PERSON> Fortney </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, D-Calif., a major force behind the catastrophic program, said Monday that `` I think they -LRB- lawmakers -RRB- feel they'd just like to get rid of this annoyance and they certainly are going to be very skeptical when I come to them in the future with a bill to help the senior citizens. <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said catastrophic care supporters `` lost the information battle'' to groups that preyed on the fears of the elderly. `` It's very easy to take very fragile, very insecure seniors who are easily confused and confuse them even further,'' he said. The income tax surcharge ranges up to $ 800 this year for Medicare-eligible people in upper income ranges. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said about 6 percent of the 33 million people covered would be hit with the maximum. Most of the 15 million or so Americans who would be subject to the surcharge at all would pay much less _ $ 15 per $ 150 of tax liability this year. The additional cost for the majority of those covered by Medicare: $ 4 per month. Both the flat monthly premium and the surtax, officially called a `` supplemental premium'' would increase in future years. Whoever won the `` information battle'' mentioned by Stark, there was no question that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members were inundated with mail urging them to repeal the program and almost none urging them to keep it. Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>, R-Wis., illustrated that in a brief speech explaining his intention to vote for repeal even before formal debate began He said he had received 2,172 letters urging repeal and one supporting the program. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Paxon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said his office received 3,807 letters urging repeal. The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act was aimed at protecting the elderly and disabled from financial ruin in the event of a prolonged hospital stay or other high medical costs. The program pays for unlimited approved hospitalization after a once-a-year deductible of $ 560 in 1989. Previously, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> charged a deductible for each hospital stay during a year and provided full payment of hospital bills only up to 59 days a year. The plan also would limit, starting Jan. 1, the amount that beneficiaries must pay for hospital care, physician services, medical supplies and prescription drugs and would expand other health care benefits as well.

<HEAD>Doctors Find First Western U.S. Case of Type 2 AIDS Virus Infection</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> case of a rare type of AIDS infection was diagnosed in a man who had sex with 20 to 40 women here since 1979, but the risk to his lovers is fairly low, doctors said Tuesday. The man, who has n't developed AIDS, `` is definitely the first case I know of on the West Coast'' of infection by HIV-2, a relative of the AIDS virus which is rare in this country compared with the main AIDS virus, HIV-1, said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, an epidemiologist at the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. Until now, only seven cases of HIV-2 infection had been confirmed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ three in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and one each in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> _ and three of the patients developed AIDS symptoms, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said by phone from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Almost all the patients imported the virus from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where HIV-2 is endemic. Of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> man's lovers, `` We've identified one individual with whom he had multiple unprotected sexual contacts over a long period of time, and that person has been tested and is not infected with this virus. That is reassuring,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerndt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s director of AIDS epidemiology. A second lover also is uninfected, but officials expect to locate only two or three more of the 20 to 40 women with whom the man had sex since he moved here in 1979 from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nation of <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kerndt </PERSON> said. The infected <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> resident is in his 30s, works full-time and attends school part-time. Officials withheld his identity. He has refrained from sex since learning three months ago he might be infected with HIV-2, said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON>, AIDS virology laboratory director at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` This man is a pretty decent person,'' <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> said. `` He's had a couple of traceable contacts and they are negative -LRB- AIDS-free -RRB-. But he had multiple other non-traceable contacts _ one-night stands. He's fully cooperative, but he does n't know these other women he had casual sex with.'' A private doctor referred the man to <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> for AIDS testing, but he was n't hospitalized, <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> said. HIV-2, or human immunodeficiency virus type 2, was first described in 1985 in West African prostitutes who had no symptoms, then was reported in 1986 in two West Africans who suffered AIDS, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. HIV-1 and HIV-2 both can cripple the body's ability to fight disease, leading to fatal infections and cancers. `` The question that remains is whether it -LRB- HIV-2 -RRB- can lead to immunodeficiency as quickly or as often as HIV-1,'' which has caused AIDS in more than 105,000 Americans, killing some 61,000 of them, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. The infected <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> man has very low levels of HIV-2 in his blood, so `` the risk of transmission in casual sexual contacts is very low,'' <PERSON> Kerndt </PERSON> said. He said the man may have been infected before coming to the country in 1979 or during a visit home in 1983. <PERSON> Kerndt </PERSON> said the infected man never donated blood, `` has not used drugs intravenously, nor has he engaged in any homosexual activity.'' So far, the risk to the blood supply is considered low because blood bank guidelines prohibit blood donations by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>, and because the test used to detect blood infected with HIV-1 can detect 85 percent to 90 percent of samples of blood infected with HIV-2, <PERSON> Kerndt </PERSON> said. HIV-2 and HIV-1 are equally common in the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, and HIV-2 may be more common in <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bissau </LOCATION> and perhaps <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said, adding that HIV-2 infection also has been reported in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 Panamanian troops loyal to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> recaptured military headquarters from rebel soldiers today after a six-hour battle and officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> agreed the coup was crushed. The rebels failed to capture <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in the coup attempt, according to the reports. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the coup appeared to have failed. The rebel troops claimed that they seized and held the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in downtown <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Troops loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> climbed the roofs of surrounding buildings, throwing hand grenades, firing mortars and sniping at targets inside the compound. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has defied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to oust him for two years and survived a coup attempt in March 1988. He has been indicted on drug charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which accuses him of having ties to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> drug traffickers. The coup announcement was read over national radio at about 11:30 a.m. It said the entire high command was forced into retirement by middle-ranking officers led by Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giraldi </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, head of the Urraca battalion in charge of security at Defense Forces headquarters. The communique was signed by <PERSON> Giraldi </PERSON>, Capt. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Licona </PERSON> of the cavalry and Capt. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Balma </PERSON> of the special forces. `` This is strictly a military movement. There is no politics involved,'' the communique said, referring to the civilian opposition that has been trying to topple <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help. The communique did not say whether any members of the high command were in custody. An hour later a man who identified himself as Lt. Col. <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castrejon </PERSON> made a television broadcast saying that forces loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` were ready to give their lives to defend Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. This is a betrayal.'' However, nobody was visible on the screen as the broadcast was made. The camera showed only a clock on a wall. The communique said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and six top colonels were being `` retired'' because they had been on active service for more than 25 years and exceeded the deadline for mandatory retirement. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, a Panamanian defector and former close aide to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that he had spoken by telephone with <PERSON> Balma </PERSON>, one of the leaders of the coup, who told him that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been wounded and was in custody. He said officers intended to send <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to face drug charges, but that it would be difficult to do so because other officers in the defense forces also were involved in the drug trade. <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> said the coup had been timed for a moment when many troops loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> were outside of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> participating in an island training exercise. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s provisional president accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of undermining his nation with `` financial terrorism, economic blackmail and political interference.'' `` The government today has had to control a new attempt at subversion, frustrated by the will of our people and our armed forces,'' President <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denied that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was involved in the operation. `` Nobody's sure what's happening there,'' the president told reporters at the White House. `` There were rumors around that this was some American operation and I can tell you that is not true.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, implying his endorsement to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, added: `` We have no argument with the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. We have no argument with them.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he was unable to confirm that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been ousted. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had advance word of the uprising. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration official said the White House was not convinced <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been toppled, although that was possible. `` We've got conflicting reports,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` There have been conflicting reports about how successful it's been.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, former Panamanian Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, an anti-Noriega activist, said before the radio announcement that the shooting was part of a coup attempt carried out by dissidents within the Defense Forces. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said there has been discontent among some officers who were passed over in recent promotions and who were dissatisfied for other reasons. `` It's been building over the past few days,'' he said. There was no confirmation of casualties, but neighbors of the headquarters in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> there were dead and wounded. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> put its troops and civilians on <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alert </ORGANIZATION>, its highest level of readiness. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in combat gear took up positions only 600 yards from the barracks, which is in downtown <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> near the canal. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> has installations at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION> and Quarry Heights, less than a mile from the barracks. The Pentagon said no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops were involved in shooting. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military jet and helicopter gunships were seen in the area, but apparently were only observing the action and did not participate. Shooting began with a few bursts of fire shortly around 7 a.m. -LRB- 8 a.m. EDT -RRB- and was continuing more than three hours later. Neighbors, who insisted on not being identified, said they heard small arms being fired and bursts of automatic weapons. Neighbors and reporters saw three ambulances leave the headquarters compound. Journalists were kept more than 100 yards away by police, backed by Panamanian armored personnel carriers and water-cannon trucks. Vehicle traffic to the headquarters compound was also blocked by the military. Armed men in civilian clothes surrounded the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political police, located about 500 yards from the headquarters. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said gunfire had been heard by forces at the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and Americans were told to avoid dangerous areas. There are about 12,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, many of them within five miles of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. All <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> civilian dependents were moved onto <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations as of July 1 in the wake of violence that followed Panamanian elections held on May 7. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto leader, assumed command of the military in 1983. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> since he was indicted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug charges in February 1988. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> says the drug charges are part of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plot to abrogate the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties and retain control of the canal at the end of the century. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> have focused on encouraging the civilian opposition and on attempting to undercut his support in the military, encouraging members of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> to ask him to leave or oust him by force. Efforts by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to remove him, including economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, have failed.

<HEAD>Court Hears Arguments on Exclusion of Evidence in Illinois Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Police misconduct is likely to increase if the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> creates a new loophole in the rule barring unlawfully obtained evidence from criminal trials, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lawyer warned Tuesday. `` Expansion of the use of unlawfully obtained evidence ... is a major step the court should not take at this time,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, arguing in behalf of a young convicted murderer before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` It would add significant incentive to police'' to violate protected rights, he contended. But <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON>, an assistant attorney general for <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, said the justices would enhance the `` truth-seeking process'' of criminal trials nationwide if allowing such an expansion. The state's arguments are supported in a `` friend-of-the-court'' brief submitted by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. At issue in the case, to be decided by July, is whether statements a criminal defendant makes after an unlawful arrest may be used by prosecutors to contradict a defense witness' trial testimony. The so-called `` exclusionary rule,'' created by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nearly 75 years ago, generally prohibits the use at trial of any illegally obtained evidence. The high court later carved out an exception to the rule by allowing prosecutors to use such evidence to contradict a defendant's own trial testimony. But the justices never have said such evidence may be used to rebut or discredit other witnesses' testimony The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, by a 4-3 vote, allowed such evidence to be introduced at the trial of <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, sentenced to 30 years in prison for a 1982 murder. <PERSON> James </PERSON> was 15 when arrested in his mother's beauty parlor for a pair of Aug. 30, 1982 shootings. He was tried as an adult. Prosecutors said <PERSON> James </PERSON> shot and killed <PERSON> Geliria </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> and wounded another youth in a late-night confrontation on a south <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> street. Several prosecution witnesses identified <PERSON> James </PERSON> as the triggerman, and testified that on the night of the crime he had long, reddish-brown hair. At his trial, <PERSON> James </PERSON> had short, black hair. <PERSON> James </PERSON> did not testify but two defense witnesses testified in his behalf. One said that <PERSON> James </PERSON> had short, black hair the night of the shootings. Prosecutors then won the judge's permission to let a police detective testify that <PERSON> James </PERSON>, when arrested, said he had long, reddish-brown hair the night of the crime and that he had his hair dyed and cut at his mother's shop. The trial judge previously had disallowed such testimony, ruling that <PERSON> James </PERSON>' arrest was unlawful because police at the time did not have a court warrant or probable cause to suspect him of committing a crime. <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON>, the state's lawyer, was questioned rigorously by Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, the court's only <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> native. If unlawfully obtained evidence can be used by prosecutors any time a defendant mounts any kind of defense, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> suggested, `` police would have every incentive'' to bend the rules. `` Police departments around the country would alter their procedures'' to make sure such evidence is obtained, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON> disagreed, saying, `` It's not correct to presume that the police would not do it right.'' The case is <PERSON> James </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, 88-6075.

 A member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday he was outraged to find Marine recruits at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, using the slogan `` kill, rape, pillage, burn'' during basic training. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., a heavily decorated retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain and ex-prisoner of war, said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> ought to be ashamed. He has asked the commandant of the corps to investigate. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>'s reaction stemmed from a photograph sent to him by the parents of a man who graduated in August from the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The 8x10 color photograph was a formal platoon graduation picture showing the recruits standing at attention on risers with the officers who trained them n the foreground. Eight of the men held four hand-painted signs bearing pictures and slogans, which one of the recruits said were used as signs for the men to march behind during training. One showed a naked woman. Another had a skull and crossbones with the words `` kill, rape, pillage, burn.'' `` I was in the service 22 years and never saw anything like this,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, who was a prisoner of war in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for 5 -LCB- years, said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's outrageous,'' he said. Capt. <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mill </PERSON>, public affairs officer at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, said the signs `` were done in bad taste which represents neither the policy nor the philosophy of this command or the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and we are taking corrective action concerning this situation.'' <PERSON> Mill </PERSON> said that the sign was made under the supervision and approval of a drill instructor, but that `` this is not a normal occurrence and I would consider this isolated incident.'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said the blame lay with the officers. `` It shows a lack of supervision,'' he said. `` We are paying those officers with taxpayers' dollars. We want them to be honorable fighting men.'' The senator, in a letter sent Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> commandant, Gen. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, said, the signs `` violate the values which Americans expect their Marines to carry with them in defense of the nation.'' `` While platoon mottoes are important to motivation and morale in the boot camp environment, the high standards of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> demands a philosophy, a set of values, a dedication and a resolve with which the enclosed photograph is simply incompatible,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> wrote. He asked <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> to look into the incident and ensure that the commanders of the the platoon in the photograph `` understand and embrace proper <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> values.'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> also asked <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> to make sure that the recruits in the photograph were contacted and `` that they understand why this type of conduct is inconsistent with the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' values and tradition.''

<HEAD>Communist Party Calls Congress for January</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Communists decided Tuesday to hold a congress in January, which could be their last because a poll of members indicates 72 percent want the party completely reorganized and given a new name. The <ORGANIZATION> Eleventh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was scheduled for Jan. 27 by a resolution accepted at a one-day meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The committee also called for congress delegates to be elected under new democratic rules. The party, officially called the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was established in its current form in 1948. After crushing election losses this year, party leaders seem determined to rename the party and create a broader leftist political organization that would include socialists and social democrats. `` People from under different shades of the red banner'' should be able to `` find their place in it,'' party Secretary <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told the committee Tuesday. The party should become `` open to reality and to the challenges that the future brings,'' he said. <PERSON> Tomasz </PERSON> <PERSON> Nalec </PERSON>, who represents a reformist club within the party, said the full party meeting should be considered `` the founding congress of a new party of democratic socialism.'' Seventy-two percent of party members polled over the past month favor changing the party's name, charter and program, according to partial results announced at the plenum's opening. The survey involved more than 1.1 million of the 2.1 million party members. Officials of the party, seeking to recast its identity since overwhelming losses to Solidarity in June's first-ever democratic parliamentary elections, say it must change to survive. Politburo member <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON> has said the party should rename itself the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Working </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>. The key changes are to be made at the congress, expected to be made up of 1,000 to 2,000 elected delegates under the leadership of First Secretary <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>. A communist official who briefed reporters before the plenum on condition of anonymity also said another shakeup in the party's ruling Politburo was expected It would be the second since July. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, discussing preparations for the congress at the plenum, said the party planned open, competitive election campaigns for congress delegates in order to get the public interested in the party's affairs. The party is inviting society to `` create the party with us,'' he said, and the party must strive to find an identity which will give it a popular base. `` The question is whether the Polish <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> can fulfill the aspirations of the part of Polish society which is left-leaning,'' he said. The pro-Solidarity newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that the draft plenum's resolution favored a multi-sector economy dominated by development of the state-run economy. The draft opposed privatizing and selling off state enterprises, a chief economic goal of the Solidarity-led government, the newspaper said. The draft also `` obliges all party cells to create conditions for free expression of different views,'' the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Historian Sees `Community of Interest' in War Coverage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A `` community of interest'' between government and the news media often limits war coverage, a historian who has studied Vietnam War reporting told newspaper editors Tuesday. Military historian <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> has stirred controversy with his book `` The Military and the Media'' by contending that, overall, news accounts of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War gave a better picture of that conflict than did official reports. But he says the news media passed over some major stories. `` The media is much less an outsider from the government than, perhaps, it might think,'' <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> told the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Managing Editors. `` There's a tremendous interplay between the government and the media. Not only do individuals constantly go from the media into government, or from the government into media ... but there is a community of interest here.'' <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, a historian at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said reporters operated with self-imposed limitations in reporting the Vietnam War, to avoid burning bridges with military authorities. `` He's going to have to be back over there again dealing with them to get some more news,'' he said. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said, news accounts sometimes informed senior military commanders of what actually was happening in the war. `` Sometimes the commander high up the chain of command is the last one to find out anything,'' he said. News coverage often prompted a change in tactics that benefited the war effort, he said. `` In this case, media coverage actually extended the vision of the commander, and he was able to make a response that was very important to the overall goal of the American military in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' But major stories that would have bruised the Army's image went largely unreported, including the persistent problems of the M-16, the primary infantry weapon used in the war, he said. Far from assisting in the war, that lack of reporting may have damaged the military effort because there was no call for changes to the M-16, <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said. `` The press in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> did not pick up the story with any consistency,'' he said. `` What happened? The military never had any kind of a prod to do much about repairing the weapon.'' The <ORGANIZATION> APME </ORGANIZATION> comprises news executives of the member newspapers of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, the newsgathering cooperative.

 A dancer who claimed she was actor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>'s common-law wife and entitled to half his money could not consider their relationship a marriage because living together is not the same thing, a judge ruled Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Silbermann </PERSON> ruled that although <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> lived with Hurt and had a child with him, a marriage did not exist, even during the time they were in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which recognizes common-law marriage. `` Absent proof of a mutual agreement to be married, an agreement to marry can not be inferred from the fact that the parties were living together,'' <PERSON> Silbermann </PERSON> wrote. `` The contrary is true.'' She also said the relationship was illicit when it began because <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> was married, and did not become legitimate simply because he got divorced. The 14-page decision did not deal with financial support for <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and the couple's 6-year-old son, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Devon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>. Hurt currently pays $ 60,000 to $ 65,000 a year to <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and the boy. Before the trial, he refused to increase the amount and <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> petitioned for $ 16,000 a month, which <PERSON> Silbermann </PERSON> rejected. `` I am thankful for the ruling received today, which is a vindication of everything I have said.'' Hurt said in a statement issued by his publicist. `` I felt that I simply could not continually give in to the pressures that have been constantly put on me for more and more money and other accommodations from <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and others,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>' lawyer said he would appeal the ruling because he felt the judge was `` madly in love'' with Hurt. `` Let five judges who are all men decide this, not one woman who is impressed by a movie star,'' <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is a trial-level court. <PERSON> Silbermann </PERSON> is `` so madly in love with this defendant, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, that we never could have gotten a fair shake. All her rulings came down that way. If we had won, I would have been shocked,'' he said. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> met Hurt in <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, in the summer of 1981 when he was 31 and a rising star and she was a 24-year-old ballerina with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> ballet. Although she knew he was still married to actress <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> began living with Hurt. They had a child less than a year later. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> based her lawsuit on four of the 10 weeks she spent with Hurt in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, during the winter of 1982-83 while he was there filming `` The Big Chill.'' Some of Hurt's other movies include `` Body Heat,'' `` Children of a Lesser God,'' `` Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' `` Broadcast News'' and `` The Accidental Tourist.'' He won an Oscar in 1986 for `` Spider Woman.''

 Many of the reforms <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> proposed Tuesday for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> were suggested to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> more than five years ago by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, but fell on deaf ears. Lawmakers are listening now. Report after report of scandal and mismanagement at the department during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration have made <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> big news, creating an impetus for reform and giving new housing secretary <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> a high-profile platform from which to promote his housing initiatives. Still, the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is unlikely to accept all of <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s ideas and almost certain to use tales of huge fees paid to <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> consultants to try to pressure <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to back up their outrage over the scandals with more money to house the victims of the mismanagement. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was quick Tuesday to credit <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for many of his recommendations and hail the bipartisan spirit with which lawmakers have been investigating past abuses. He was equally quick to assess the political impact of the problems, believed to have cost the government more than $ 6 billion. `` This problem has turned out to be, I believe, and will turn out to be, a blessing in disguise because it's giving us an opportunity to get back on the right track,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told reporters. There's no disagreement on that point, but there are myriad views on just what `` the right track'' should be. For example, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> proposed eliminating the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program. Many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> support the program and were successful in fighting back repeated efforts by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to kill it. This year has brought reports of widespread influence peddling in the program, allowing millions of dollars to be steered to former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials and developers who hired <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> constultants. But many prominent Democrats still believe that the program is the best way to rehabilitate housing for low-income families and the elderly and think that restrictions on lobbying and a competitive financing process would end the abuses. Many of those same Democrats also suspect the administration will use the scandals to shrink or eliminate other <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> favors. `` It's extremely important we do not allow the scandal during the previous administration, the mismanagement, the lost billions, to drive us into giving up the goal, which is to provide affordable, safe, healthy, reasonable housing for tens of millions of American families,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., and the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee investigating <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Ideological fights over housing programs will no doubt continue and probably will block any major redirection of housing policy in the short term. But the scandals _ <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s `` blessing in disguise'' _ and his involving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the drafting of his reform package likely will prevent fights over the management aspects of <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s plan so big that they must be settled in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` You ca n't let ideology get in the way when you have an opportunity like this,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., a member of the Lantos subcommitee `` People are paying a lot of attention to this now and there's a lot of momentum I sure do n't want to lose.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation Tuesday that will allow continuned logging of the old-growth forests in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> while at the same time imposing protections for the spotted owl. The legislation was part of the Interior appropriations bill for the fiscal year that began Sunday, which was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on a 381-41 vote. Final approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected this week. The action came over the objections of Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Ore., who said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was caving into the demands of `` radical'' environmentalists and the legislation would result in a `` substantial and grevious reduction'' in timber harvest `` This is beyond compromise; this is surrender,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the legislation would do little to end the litigation that has tied up timber sales in the region's federal forests and would cost thousands of jobs. But in a series of heated exchanges with <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, Democratic Reps. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state defended the compromise legislation. `` I regret my colleague from <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> finds fault with this compromise,'' said <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>. `` I find fault. But you ca n't sit on a porch ... and call it surrender.'' <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON> said the legislation would save roughly 11,000 jobs in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> threatened by current court injunctions barring logging in old-growth forests which provide prime nesting habitat for the owl. `` I understand the gentleman's frustration,'' said <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>. `` But sometimes in the political process you have to deal with what is practical and doable.'' <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> and <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON> said that more than 100 House members had expressed opposition to a Senate-passed timber plan which would have drastically curbed the power of the federal courts to halt timber sales and had vowed to oppose any effort to pass it in the House. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had supported the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan. `` I supported the Senate amendment too, but it was n't going to pass,'' said <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>. `` It's better to save 11,000 jobs then get mowed down in a ball of flame.'' But <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was n't about to back down. `` I always thought a majority around here was 218 -LRB- votes -RRB- and not 100,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` Radical environmentalists have percipitated a three-ring circus in the forests, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the courts.'' The compromise legislation, which has the reluctant support of many industry and environmental groups, will allow 9.6 billion board feet of timber to be sold in the region's federal forest during the new fiscal year. It also imposes strict deadlines on the corts for resolving appeals of individual timber sales, requires that about half the sales currently enjoined be released and requires that federal agencies `` minimize fragmentation of environmentally significant old-growth forest stands.'' The Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is trying to decide whether to list the northern spotted owl as a threatened species. Such a listing would require federal agencies, including the major timber-selling agencies, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, to avoid actions that would destroy habitat. Biologists say the owl lives almost exclusively in the old-growth forests of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, with each nesting pair requiring a large amount of undisturbed forest.

<TEXT>
 An official of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring force said Tuesday the demobilization of a controversial police unit over the weekend was not conducted properly and must be done again. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the multinational force, said procedures used by territorial police to demobilize the former <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> counterinsurgency unit Saturday were `` not at all satisfactory.'' <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON> said only 900 of <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION>'s estimated 1,200 former members showed up for the demobilization at a northern police base, and no steps were taken to identify them or ascertain the whereabouts of their weapons. Since arriving in April to monitor <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to independence, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have sought to deactivate all police who served with <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> _ which means crowbar in <LOCATION> Afrikaans </LOCATION> _ during a 23-year war between South African-led security forces and pro-independence guerrillas. The unit, made up of black Namibians commanded by white officers, was accused of atrocities during the war and of harassing guerrilla supporters since April, when its members were integrated into the regular police force. <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roux </PERSON>, spokesman for the territorial administrator installed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, said police would try to trace the remaining 300 ex-Koevoet members and serve them with demobilization papers. He said there would be no further demobilization ceremonies, and added that the unit's weapons were stored securely at <LOCATION> Okave </LOCATION> police base. U.N.-supervised elections are scheduled for Nov. 7-11 to elect an assembly to draft a constitution for an independent <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which waged the guerrilla war, is favored to get the most votes but needs a two-thirds majority to have full control of the assembly. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since World War I, in violation of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions since 1966.

 A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> committee Tuesday recommended probation for nine students in a fraternity prank that stranded two students naked and painted with racial slurs at a mostly black college. The disciplinary committee recommended that the university's chancellor expel a 10th student and suspend four others Most of the students were pledges to the Beta Theta Pi fraternity Sept. 18, when two members of the fraternity's Ole Miss chapter were carried by car to <ORGANIZATION> Rust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a small, private school 25 miles to the north. They were stripped naked, their hands and feet bound with duct tape and their bodies painted with such things as `` KKK'' and `` We hate niggers.'' The two, who are white, were picked up by Rust security officers. The students facing disciplinary action also are white. Ole Miss Chancellor <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> last week banned Beta Theta Pi from the school for three years and ordered the fraternity house closed. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> has final say on discipline against the students, whose names were not released.

<HEAD>Official Says US Sanctions Promote Changes in South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Tuesday that sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had opposed had `` played a role'' in moderating the apartheid policies of that nation's government. The official also left open the possibility of further <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions against the white-ruled government, an option the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration refused even to consider. `` Sanctions have played a role in stimulating new thinking within the white power structure,'' said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, assistant secretary of State for <LOCATION> Aftican </LOCATION> affairs, in an admission never made by officials of the previous administration. `` It is now increasingly clear to that government that the well being of the white minority can not be sustained without a negotiated political settlement that results in political equality for all <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` I can not imagine your predecessor -LRB- in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration -RRB- making that statement,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations subcomittee on <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, applauding the formulation as `` a shift in position. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said that while he would n't characterize the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's position as a change, the White House does recognize that without positive steps to dismantle <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of racial apartheid, `` pressures will build for more sanctions. It becomes clear, he said, `` that we can not wait indefinitely.'' However, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> discouraged calls for stiffer measures, saying the administration by far prefers a course of negotiations, not punitive sanctions. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s testimony coincided with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s release of a congressionally mandated report to determine the impact of sanctions imposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1986 and to evaluate whether additional measures are necessary. While asserting that the 1986 sanctions have not succeeded in abolishing apartheid, the report said `` there is some reason for hope that the opportunity for a peaceful end to apartheid has not yet been lost.'' The study said `` further sanctions are not needed at this time and would be counterproductive in view of steps being taken within <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the region to bring about change through peaceful means.'' The report concluded additional sanctions mandated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` have not to date been successful in moving the South African government toward the goals ... that are shared by the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said the administration is committed to effectively enforcing the existing sanctions `` in the hope and expectation that positive signs of a commitment to change will appear in the near future.'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s appearance represented the first administration testimony on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since the inauguration of the government of President <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> who campaigned for the office on a moderate platform. `` For the first time in years it is possible to be somewhat hopeful that a negotiation scenario may be just beyond the horizon,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said, adding that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> appears to be entering a period of `` talking about talks.'' External and internal pressures are helping convince the South African government that it must `` move beyond its current position and accept fundamental change,'' he said. `` In fact, the new <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> government has indicated it is prepared to take concrete steps to address this need.'' `` For this reason, the administration recommends that no new sanctions be considered at the present time,'' he said. During the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration the Democratic majority in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> engaged in fierce battles with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> over South African policy, battles which resulted in the passage of comprehensive economic sanctions in 1986. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was quickly identified by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> `` as an area where the breakdown of bipartisan support undercut the ability of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to encourage a peaceful transition to democracy.'' `` We want to be able to send a a clear signal of broad, bipartisan support for a policy premised on unequivocal abhorrence of apartheid, reflected in a sustained <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to promoting negotiations btween the government of in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> and legitimate black representatives leading to a non-racial and democratic <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. Another witness, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., complained, however, that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is engaged in `` unacceptable foot dragging'' on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` We should make clear we are prepared to impose additional <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, if there is no progress,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said, suggesting that leverage might be found in negotiations set for next year to restructured $ 9 billion in South African debt to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed legislation Tuesday making a national historic site of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, estate where <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and his wife lived before the Civil War. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also signed a separate bill paving the way for the acquisition of three additional houses adjacent to <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s home in Independence, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, which is already a national historic site. The 9.65-acre <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> estate, called White Haven, was the home of <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>. The Grants lived there from 1854 to 1860 and owned the estate until <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s death in 1885. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> led the Union troops in the Civil War and became the 18th president in 1869. `` The Grants lived together at White Haven during the crucial pre-Civil War years. It was during this time that <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s strength of character was developed through economic adversity,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> developed then such traits as `` a relentless pursuit of success and a determination to move ahead despite temporary setbacks'' that later served him well both `` as an incomparable military leader'' and in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. While saying White Haven will be `` a worthy addition to the National Park System,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed chagrin that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed it without first waiting for a formal study as the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had recommended. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that in the future, completion of a formal study `` should be a prerequisite for establishment of any new unit of the National Park System.'' `` Such studies enable the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to examine the suitability, feasibility and alternatives for managing proposed new park units,'' the president said. White Haven is in what are now the suburbs of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The County of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> acquired the home after a civic campaign was launched in 1985 to save the Grant estate. While the legislation, sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., and others, stipulates that the estate will be donated to the government as a historic site, it allows the government to acquire other Grant artifacts by either donation or purchase It also authorizes the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to spend up to $ 1 million restoring the estate, and estimates the annual operating budget and upkeep at $ 400,000. The separate <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> legislation authorizes the government to spend $ 250,000 acquiring three houses in Independence adjacent to the <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> home, giving the current owners the right of tenancy for 25 years or until death, whichever is later. Administration officials estimated it will cost $ 75,000 to repair and convert a vacant house into a visitors' center, with an annual operating cost of $ 15,000. The measure was sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheat </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., and others <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, the 33rd president, died in 1972.

<HEAD>Chicago Sues Flag Artists to Test Desecration Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERI T. PRASSO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ten artists who want to display works featuring the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag are being sued by the city, which wants to test a new statute outlawing flag desecration, lawyers said Tuesday. `` These artists each have done works that depict the flag,'' said <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Needless to say, curators and galleries were hesitant to display them,'' <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, whose organization is representing the artists. The lawsuit, filed Monday in <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, was moved to the court of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marovich </PERSON> after the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> said the case raised questions of constitutionality. `` Even though the artists are named as defendants, essentially we are asking the judge to make a decision as to whether the flag ordinance is constitutional and can be enforced,'' said <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Busceni </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the office of the city's corporation counsel. `` If it is, we'll decide what we want to do then'' regarding prosecuting the artists for their displays, she said. The artists' sculptures, paintings and collages are part of a two-month exhibit probing censorship of the arts. The artists could not be reached immediately for comment. The multi-media exhibit, called `` Inalienable Rights, Alienable Wrongs,'' also features poetry readings and film. Bookstores, galleries and theaters are showing segments of the exhibit from Sept. 15 through Nov. 15, said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s legal director. Galleries, fearing prosecution, have refused to display the segment focusing on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag, he said. `` These artists and curators must be able to exhibit their works without the threat of arrest, seizure of their art and meritless prosecutions,'' <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> sent a letter Sept. 25 to the city's attorneys and the police chief on behalf of the 10 artists, who believed they might be arrested if their flag-related works were shown. Instead of responding directly, <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said, the city filed the lawsuit to seek clarification of the ordinance passed March 16. The measure was prompted by the controversy that erupted when student artist `` Dread'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> placed a flag on the floor for his piece, `` What is the Proper Way to Display a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Flag?'' The work was part of a student exhibit at the School of the Art Institute of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s work outraged many veterans and others. Thousands marched and demonstrated at the museum, demanding removal of the work. The City Council then passed the ordinance barring the display of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags on the floor or of flags that have been marked or have items attached to them. It also prohibits reproducing the flag on merchandise or containers. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> said the law is vague and the wording makes it unclear what type of artwork would be in violation of the ordinance. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, one of the artists named in the suit, does not have a listed telephone and could not be reached through an artists' group with which he is affiliated.

<HEAD>New State Rules Ban Gay Men, IV Drug Users From Donating Sperm</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sperm banks in the state can no longer accept gay men and intravenous drug users as donors because of new state health regulations prompted by fears about AIDS, officials said Tuesday. For the first time, sperm banks must get a state license and must subject all donors to at least two AIDS tests before their sperm is used, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardineer </PERSON>, an associate director of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Women who choose to undergo artificial insemination should not be subjected to unnecessary risks for serious and even fatal illnesses,'' she said. The regulations took effect Monday and automatically exclude a person from donating sperm if he has had homosexual activity, intravenous drug use or sex since 1977 with a person at high risk for the AIDS virus. The same people already are barred from donating blood in the state for the same reason, <PERSON> Gardineer </PERSON> said. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> have no documented cases of AIDS being transmitted through sperm donors, said a spokesman, <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gardineer </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> had one case _ eight women who received sperm from the same donor, who tested positive for the AIDS virus. Four of the women later tested positive for the virus, but three of their babies born through artificial insemination were healthy, <PERSON> Gardineer </PERSON> said. The fourth pregnancy never came to term. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state has about one-quarter of the nation's AIDS cases with 25,000 confirmed cases. <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, said he had no problem with the sperm bank prohibition against gay men. `` We have the same goal in mind, which is having a safe sperm bank,'' <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> said. The new state rules forbid the release of a sperm donor's name and address, except in cases where the man specifically gives his consent. <PERSON> Gardineer </PERSON> said she could not be sure how many sperm banks the state has because they have never been licensed before. The regulations do n't apply in cases where a person is donating sperm for a specific person, such as his wife.

 A free-lance cameraman accused in a newspaper of faking combat footage aired on `` The CBS Evening News'' met Tuesday with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, a representative of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said. However, the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> representative declined comment when asked whether <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> and cameraman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> discussed the accusations against <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, or whether another meeting has been scheduled. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported claims last Wednesday that footage broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 was fake _ that <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> had staged scenes of guerrilla sabotage and had made a Pakistani jet fighter on a training run appear to be a Soviet plane bombing Afghan villages. As a free-lancer, <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> sold the film to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, which he said had approved his proposals for trips inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to film the war there. Some of his footage also was used in a 1987 `` CBS Reports'' documentary, `` The Battle for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' The Post reported earlier Tuesday that <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> had flown in from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> interview and would be accompanied by an attorney at the meeting. The cameraman, who last week did not return calls made by reporters to his residences in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, was not available for comment Tuesday. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, too, was not available. On Tuesday afternoon, his secretary told one reporter seeking to interview the news division president on the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s claims: `` We're not taking any press calls. The press calls are being taken by the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- press office.'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, who rarely grants interviews under any circumstances, has made no direct comment on the newspaper's report. His only comment, made last Wednesday in a prepared statement, was that it `` is the goal of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in every instance to gather and report the news accurately, fairly and with integrity. In the case of the Afghan war, we believe we have done so.'' <PERSON> Joh </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' affiliates board and head of its news subcommittee, said Friday that the network's affiliate relations executives have told him <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> officials are looking into the matter.

 Lebanese legislators considered a proposal Tuesday to expand the 99-seat Parliament, giving Moslems more representation under a new constitution aimed at ending the long sectarian civil war. They also examined ways of increasing the powers of the prime minister, traditionally a Sunni Moslem, <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> sources said on condition of anonymity. Sixty-three of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s 73 surviving deputies have been meeting in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> since Saturday in a session removed from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> because of a battle that began in March between Christians and a Moslem alliance led by Syrian troops. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Shara </PERSON> said his country would not withdraw its 40,000 soldiers and claimed the military presence guarantees some stability in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, he said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> would help a Lebanese government of `` national reconciliation to extend its authority all over the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> territory, motivated by the special Syrian-Lebanese relationship.'' In <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, leaders of the two main Moslem militia factions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Druse </ORGANIZATION> chieftain <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> militia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, conferred with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> told them: `` <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is an Islamic country, and control must be wrenched out of Maronite -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- hands.'' The trip to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> prompted fears among some legislators that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would try to undermine their peace efforts. A new charter they are considering would give the Cabinet the power to veto presidential decisions. The authority of the president himself, a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> under <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 46-year-old unwritten national covenant, would otherwise remain untouched. Christians have dominated the government, army and judiciary since <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. They were considered to be the majority in 1943, but Moslems now are estimated to account for 55 percent of the 4 million people. Conference sources said the legislators were moving toward `` balancing and overlapping powers'' of the president, prime minister and the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker, who traditionally is a Shiite Moslem. The draft charter was put forth by an Arab League committee of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, which has a mandate to settle the 14-year-old civil war by the end of November. Sources said the draft would increase the number of deputies in the unicameral Parliament to from 99 to 128, but many legislators appeared to favor adding only nine seats, all for Moslems. Ten days ago, the Arab committee succeeded in halting six months of bloody duels between Christian army units under Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and Syrian troops. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> sent troops into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Christians want the Syrian soldiers removed, describing them as an occupation force rather than peacekeepers. The legislators are expected to formulate the charter while in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> but leave its ratification for another session, tentatively planned for Oct. 21 in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>

 A custodian was fatally shot Tuesday in front of about 100 children and teachers in an elementary school cafeteria by a gunman who opened fire on pupils in the playground before he fled, police said. Police arrested <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 24, who quit his job as a janitor at the school shortly before the shooting, warning that he was mad and that somebody would get hurt, said <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Undersheriff <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON>, 35, was shot in the head with a .22 - caliber rifle from across the cafeteria, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> He died instantly as he sat on a stage. No children were injured at Killearn Lakes Elementary, but there was `` total pandemonium for a short period of time,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` We believe it was an employee ex-employee situation,'' he said. `` There's been no indication as to any other motivation.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was arrested soon after the shooting on charges of murder, aggravated assault and resisting arrest after a brief scuffle with police about five miles away and just 200 yards from another school. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> quit his job, left the school, went to his car and got a rifle, then re-entered the building through the cafeteria, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` One of the teachers was very close to the victim,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` When it happened, the teacher hollered to somebody to call the office. The suspect looked at her, brought the rifle around, stated ` If you call the office, you'll be next.''' The teacher ducked to the floor and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> left the cafeteria, <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> said. The school's head custodian encountered <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> as he left the building and asked him what he was doing with a rifle. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> then fired twice at the more than 50 children on the playground, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. Pupils returned to their classrooms and teachers, social workers and police officers told them `` the ` bad guy' was in custody, that nobody was going to hurt them,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. Parents flocked to school, in a fashionable, forested area just north of the city, as word of the shooting spread.

<TEXT>
 Cable television's <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it has bought cable TV rights to 26 current motion pictures, including the hits `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' and `` Three Men and a Baby,'' in a multimillion-dollar deal. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, which bought the package from <ORGANIZATION> Touchstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, said it would start airing the films next May. But no decision had been made which would be the first to be shown, officials of the company said. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'s purchase is `` a reflection of a changing marketplace'' for syndicated films, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacquemin </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Buena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, the TV sales arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Touchstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. `` We think it's one business now,'' he said, referring to broadcasting and cable. The latter, according to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is in 51 million of the estimated 92.1 million homes with television. `` It really is a syndication breakthrough for us,'' said <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> president <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Koplovitz </PERSON> said, whose company last year said it was spending $ 250 million for original made-for-cable TV movies airing this year and next. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'s purchase price for the 26 motion pictures pictures was not disclosed, although sources close to the deal estimated it at about $ 50 million. The sale was announced at a news conference here. The films, some of which already have aired on pay cable after their theatrical runs, include `` The Dead Poets Society,'' the recently-released `` An Innocent Man'' with <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>, and the upcoming `` Blaze'' and `` <PERSON> Stella </PERSON>,'' which star <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>, respectively. According to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'s senior vice-president for programming, the films face two steps before airing on <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, which says it has more than 49 million subscriberss and is one of the nation's largest basic cable services. The smaller Showtime network, a pay cable with nearly 10.5 million subscribers, according to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, can air the films first under an existing agreement. Then, he said, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> could buy rights to air the films on their networks.

<HEAD>Official Says U.S. Could Lose Greek Bases</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 There's a possibility <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces will have to withdraw from their four major bases in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> next year, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Tuesday. Negotiations on continued use of the bases are expected to resume after elections and formation of a new Greek government in November. Once the talks restart, `` I do n't think anyone can rule out that the negotiations might be unsuccessful,'' Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` I think we're close to agreement,'' <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> said, describing the situation at the last session of the negotiations in May. But there are many uncertainties, he indicated in answering a battery of questions. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> expects to resume negotiations but `` we do n't know'' what kind of government will be elected or what its mandate will be. `` The answer is yes,'' <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> answered with evident hesitation to the question of whether there was any contingency planning for dismantling of the bases by <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s May, 1990, deadline for a new agreement. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s interim government said in July the installations must be dismantled by then if a new pact is not concluded. A five-year agreement signed by the former <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> government expired last year and the 1990 deadline was fixed for removal of the bases in absence of new arrangements. The current governing coalition of conservatives and leftists has said it will avoid national issues, including the bases matter, until after the election. It was formed after the June 18 vote failed to give any simgle party a majority in the 300-member one-chamber parliament. The interim government has said it will deal mainly with scandals surrounding officials of the defeated administration of Prime Minister <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>. Two of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases are on the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s 6th Fleet refuels and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> maintains a communications station. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has a listening post near <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has a support group at <LOCATION> Hellenikon </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Abortion Restrictions Proposed in House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE McGRAW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A lawmaker introduced a measure Tuesday that would place sweeping restrictions on abortion in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and directly challenge a 1973 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling giving women the right to end a pregnancy. Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Freind </PERSON>, R-Del., outlined the five-part proposal he said shows <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> will `` always be down-the-line pro-life. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year gave states broader powers to restrict a woman's access to abortions. Freind's bill, which has the backing of Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, could be the first to be adopted since that ruling in July. Also Tuesday, a legislative committee in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, recommended approval of a measure to repeal an obsolete state law establishing prison penalties for women who have abortions and doctors who perform them. The bill would repeal the currently unenforceable penalties for both physicians and women, although a law passed in 1985 stated women who had abortions would not be prosecuted. At a Capitol news conference in <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Freind </PERSON> said his proposal would give the high court another chance to overturn the `` Roe vs. Wade'' decision. His legislation would require a 24-hour waiting period before a woman can have an abortion; outlaw all abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy except to save the woman's life; and ban abortions used for choosing the sex of a child. It also would require notification of the husband before a woman has an abortion except in a few cases; order physicians to inform women of the surgical procedure to be used, the fetus' stage of development, the dangers of childbirth and abortion, and alternatives to abortion; and ban most fetal experimentation, which includes prohibiting the sale and use of tissue, organs or other remains from the aborted fetus. After the news conference, an estimated 8,500 anti-abortion advocates cheered Freind and his proposal at a rally on the state Capitol steps. People carried graphic signs showing aborted fetuses and saying `` The unborn need freedom too,'' and `` Pro-choice means pro murder.'' More than 5,000 pro-choice supporters held a rally here last week. `` One difference between them and us is that we have joy and they ca n't,'' <PERSON> Freind </PERSON> said. `` Because there is nothing joyous in the killing of unborn children.'' Freind's bill has more than 70 co-sponsors, some of whom joined him at the news conference and the rally along with leaders of various anti-abortion groups. The lawmaker said he expected his proposal to pass the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and move to the governor sometime later this month or early next month. Also Tuesday, abortion rights advocates formally introduced their legislative package. It includes a proposed constitutional amendment affirming a woman's right to have an abortion. The pro-choice bills would restore government funding for poor women who have `` medically necessary'' abortions and would weaken a state law that requires parental notification or a court order before a minor can obtain an abortion. That provision is not in effect because it under court review. Pro-choice advocates said a majority of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s voters support a woman's right to choose. In a poll of 500 likely voters in the state, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> said 60 percent of the respondents favored keeping abortion legal, while 33 percent wanted to outlaw it. `` This data shows how dramatically out-of-step <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s officials are with their constituents on abortion,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, the league's executive director `` The political atmosphere surrounding choice is more highly charged than ever. ... Politicians in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> who support abortion restrictions in 1989 may well be voted out of office in 1990.'' The poll, conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Hickman-Maslin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percent. The polling was done Sept. 25-28.

 Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> on Tuesday proposed major management changes at the scandal-tarred <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, including eliminating programs and a special fund he said either were tainted by political influence or not targeted to the needy. `` Many past funding decisions were, frankly, based on political influence rather than merit,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said in releasing his 58-point plan to reform the agency. `` Under my stewardship, no decisions will be made at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> for the political advantage or personal gain of any one person or of a political party.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, in his first news conference as secretary, also announced that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has barred from doing government business a mortgage lender whose defaults in a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> program total more than $ 700 million. While praising the congressional investigation of influence peddling, fraud and mismanagement at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he did not believe it was necessary to appoint a special prosecutor, as suggested by some Republicans and Democrats involved in the reviews. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s proposed changes range from regulatory and administrative steps he can take immediately to more complex changes that would require congressional approval. The agency's <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and its multibillion-dollar loan programs would be significantly affected, with several programs <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said have deviated from helping the needy eliminated outright. And the entire agency would be subjected to intense public scrutiny through the publishing of all funding and other major decisions in the Federal Register. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> also promised to improve targeting of scarce <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funds to those most in need and vowed to try to collect money bilked from the agency in the past. More proposals are likely, he said, after additional reviews of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> management. Initial reaction from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was favorable, although there was opposition to what some lawmakers interpreted as a <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> effort to kill the Section 8 <ORGANIZATION> Moderate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general said in April was riddled with influence peddling by former agency officials and prominent Republican consultants. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> did not directly propose killing the program but referred to its problems and said its goals could be accomplished through several other <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs. `` I think the secretary's recommendations with respect to ethics, management reform, tighter fiscal controls, the introduction of a chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, are all excellent,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., the chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee investigation of the department `` When we come into the programatic field, I think we'll have to study those recommendations much more carefully,'' said <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, among a number of lawmakers who said they were not yet convinced the rehabilitation program should be killed instead of reformed. Many of <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s proposals mirror those in a largely ignored 1984 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, while others were molded after more recent suggestions made in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to limit the role of lobbyists and consultants in government funding decisions. Still others came from <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> aides after their own review. Eliminated along with the `` Mod Rehab'' program would be discretionary funds under the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary's control. `` We are trying to get rid of the slush fund approach,'' said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> DelliBovi </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> budgets traditionally have included a large set-aside for the secretary's discretionary fund, and <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and congressional investigators have found several instances in which projects that had been opposed by agency experts were funded through the account. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> also proposed killing another program, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s Title X land development insurance, citing use of the money to build upscale projects such as a condominium-golf complex in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> programs for vacation home loans, But he said he was committed to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s co-insurance program, to date the source of nearly $ 1 billion in sour loans. The program allows private lenders to approve HUD-insured mortgages and was a major part of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's efforts to reduce the federal work force by contracting business to private companies. The company <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said has been barred from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> work, <ORGANIZATION> DRG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has experienced defaults on $ 709 million of the $ 1.1 billion in HUD-insured loans it approved. The government is liable for 80 percent of such mortgages. `` The problem was not the idea,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` The problem was in the implementation of the idea. ... These reforms are designed to make a good idea better.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said the program would be revived with improved <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> oversight of the lenders and new certification requirements for the lenders, appraisers and others involved in handling the applications. Other highlights of the <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> package include: _ Appointment of a chief financial officer for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and a separate comptroller for the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION>, whose loan programs have been troubled by fraud and mismanagement believed to have cost more than $ 4 billion _ Requiring all lobbyists and consultants who work on <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> proposals to register with the department and disclose their fees, which <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> could deduct from any funding awards <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to impose civil fines of up to $ 10,000 for violations of the registration requirement. He also proposed similar fines for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employees who disclose funding decisions prior to public announcements. _ Allocating up to $ 100 million for monitoring of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> housing and community development programs <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said the department now spends less than $ 25 million to track annual grants totaling nearly 10 times that amount. _ Allowing <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials to adjust subsidy and loan amounts to take into account other benefits developers receive for building low-income housing, including tax credits _ Increasing the staff of the department's inspector general and granting the office the power to subpoena witnesses for its investigations _ Offering incentives to low-income homeowners who got HUD-insured mortgages to encourage them to refinance at today's lower interest rates, something <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said could save the government $ 200 _ Raising from 60 percent to 100 percent the amount of Community Development Block Grant money that affluent communities must spend on projects benefiting low - and moderate-income _ Requiring the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> to be audited annually and to begin program-by-program accounting and regional accounting <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said that shoddy record keeping has prevented a thorough audit of <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> for the past 15 years, that umbrella accounting practices have failed to detect problems in specific programs and that current practices do not take into account regional differences in the real estate market.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> issued an order Tuesday banning free travel to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> but agreed that at least 10,000 of its citizens already in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> could emigrate to the West. East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of `` insolently breaking promises'' by letting the East Germans into its embassies in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. `` They believe in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that they can destabilize <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with a broad-based attack, but it will not work,'' he said in his first major speech since returning to work after a long convalescence from gallbladder surgery. ADN, the official East German news agency, carried his remarks. The crackdown on travel came after hundreds of East Germans stormed through police lines to get inside the embassy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. They climbed facades, rooftops and a fence to reach the crowded compound. Many were left blood-spattered by police and some fell unconscious inside the grounds. <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON>, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief of staff, initially said East German refugees would begin leaving <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by train Tuesday evening, but their departure was delayed for hours. Police were withdrawn from the railroad station at 10 p.m., and an hour later the refugees were still in and around the embassy, waiting in freezing weather. <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> said an estimated 4,700 refugees in the the embassy and about 6,000 milling outside would be traveling west. He said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was informed of the East German decision by Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s decision appeared to be part of an effort to avoid possible embarrassing disturbances during celebrations of the communist state's 40th anniversary Saturday. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobachev </PERSON> is scheduled to attend. Thousands of East Germans have streamed across the border into neighboring <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and to other Soviet bloc countries in the last few weeks in an attempt to reach <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gemany </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said the travel ban stemmed from reports `` that certain circles in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are preparing provocations'' in conjunction with the celebrations. Last weekend, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> agreed to the departure of about 7,000 refugees from the West German embassies in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but said it was a one-time arrangement. Previously, East Germans did not need a visa or passport to reach <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said such documents would be required from now on. That effectively bans all ordinary East Germans from traveling to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. It also will make it much more difficult for East Germans to reach <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, where the liberal leadership opened its western border Sept. 11, since the usual route to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is through <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> closed its embassy early Tuesday after thousands of East Germans streamed into the compound overnight, bringing the total seeking asylum there to some 4,500. Red Cross officials said they feared sanitation problems. After the East German decision was announced, the embassy opened its doors, refugees said. Hundreds of East Germans hopeful of gaining access to the embassy had continued arriving throughout Tuesday, and they grew desperate as the day wore on. Police had blockaded the embassy garden fence, but nearly 300 refugees stormed the police lines, scaled the fence and fought off club-wielding police trying to keep them back. `` They clubbed like mad,'' a Czechoslovak witness said. Witnesses said many people were injured in scuffles with police. Others got caught on the sharp spikes at the top of the fence and still others jumped or fell head first to the ground. Some lay unconscious inside the compound, witnesses said. `` This is pandemonium,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> assistant handling injured refugees. Only a doctor and several refugees witnessed the incident. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, chief government spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> refused to talk to <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> by telephone Tuesday about the problem. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> aides told the West Germans preparations for Satuday's celebrations precluded an `` appointment for a telephone call.'' The Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda came to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s defense, accusing <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of interfering in East German affairs West German officials have said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was instrumental in winning the release of the East German refugees during the weekend. Earlier Tuesday, Czechoslovak government spokesman <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> said the East Germans in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> were seriously upsetting `` public order.'' He said other embassies in the area, including the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, had requested increased protection. In the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, the number of East Germans arriving over the past two days reached about 300, officials said. Refugees in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> said their government was no longer issuing the special travel cards needed for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as quickly as in the past. More than 120,000 East Germans have reached <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> so far this year, either legally or illegally. They say they are denied basic freedoms in their country. West German Ambassador <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> was summoned to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to receive a formal protest note for what the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said was West German violation of the 1961 convention on diplomatic relations. The protest referred to the `` undesirable situation'' caused by the `` illegal stay of GDR -LRB- East German -RRB- citizens'' at <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s mission and said <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> expects West German authorities will seek to prevent a repetition of the situation

 Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday pledged mutual trust and understanding on cross-boundary issues, agreeing to conduct trade negotiations and to clean up <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION> pollution. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> publicly raised the touchy trade issue, calling on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to open its markets to Mexican products _ something <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say is largely true anyway. During a lengthy toast that amounted to a speech at a state dinner in his honor at the White House, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> noted changes in the Mexican economy. `` Few economies have opened up as much and as rapidly as <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s. A similar opening of the American market would not only represent reciprocal treatment, but a stimulus to our new friendship,'' the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> leader said. He praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for open and substantial dialogue and said it signalled `` a new relationship of friendship free of myths and mistrusts.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a very brief toast also talked of close ties between the two neighbors and thanked <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> for his efforts in fighting drug trafficking. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during his presidential campaign said he would seek a free trade agreement with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, possibly akin to the one negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> Canda </ORGANIZATION> under former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. However, no such agreement has materialized. To mark <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the two governments signed seven agreements on trade, environment, investment, and tourism. The agreements, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in praising the `` closeness'' of U.S.-Mexico ties, `` are concrete examples of how our administrations have worked closely together during the last 10 months. They show what can and must be done to make relations between our two great nations even closer than they are today.'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> also cheered for a close relationship, but said his primary goal in facilitating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was to `` open up additional sources of employment in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for Mexicans.'' The agreements were generally non-specific, but two environmental pacts commit the nations to construct an international sewage treatment plant in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, just across the border from <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>. They also will conduct joint scientific and technical projects to fight air pollution in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The sewage problem has become a matter of increasing U.S.-Mexican tensions because <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION> waste pollutes the waters and the beaches of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The agreement provides that the new plant will provide secondary treatment and disposal of waste not now treated in <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, in remarks at the signing ceremony also acknowledged <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is `` the most polluted city in the world. ... We want better air for the Mexicans for their children and for children of their children in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' The two countries agreed to work on the problem of smog in the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> capital, through `` technology transfers, scientific and technical advice, environmental monitoring, and environmental impact assessments by Mexican authorities, joint meetings and reviews, exchange of relevant personnel and exchanges of environmental information and data, coordination on national programs'' and funding cooperation. A separate environmental agreement committed the two countries to address air pollution in urban border areas, beginning with <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ciudad </PERSON> <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The agreement on trade, signed at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and his Mexican counterpart, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Solana </PERSON>, was an agreement to negotiate toward `` facilitating and enhancing'' U.S.-Mexico trade relations. In November, the two countries are to decide what trade issues are negotiable. A separate agreement commited the countries to work on easing investment opportunity for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said that pact, `` will further the investment processes so that Mexicans can find a job in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. That is the central purpose of my visit to this country.'' Secretary of Commerce <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> will travel to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in November to discuss the investment situation, officials said. The Mexican president was with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when word arrived from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that gunshots had been heard near the military headquarters of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. There were reports of a coup attempt. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were briefed on what details were available by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in an outdoor White House welcoming ceremony for <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said the two countries must cooperate in efforts to bring about democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as well as for fair elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> `` must continue to strengthen our assault on the plague of drug use and trafficking. For we know that what threatens one nation in our hemisphere threatens us all.'' `` We can strike lethal blows against drug trafficking to free the world from that international scourge,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> added, vowing to fight jointly against illegal narcotics trafficking. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> speaking through a translator called for more humane ways to deal with migration of Mexicans to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Mexican called for a `` new stage'' in trade relations. He earlier had said he would seek trade concessions Mexican exports such as textiles, steel and agricultural products. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have disagreed with his contention that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has difficulty penetrating American markets. One official said that until recently <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was one of the most protectionist countries in the world. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has a $ 2.7 billion trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on total two-way trade of $ 43.9 billion, the official said. The administration and the Mexicans also signed a tourism agreement geared toward easing procedures to promote <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tourism in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court Calls Textbook Inspection Legal, But Finds History Distortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Japanese court Tuesday ruled legal a government program of screening school textbooks, including deleting references to some Japanese military actions in World War II. Such government screening brought protests earlier from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other countries, which accused <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of trying to cover up military brutality. Despite its ruling on wartime operations, the court held in one case that a government-ordered rewrite distorted history. The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in Professor <PERSON> Saburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Iyenaga </PERSON>'s 25-year battle against the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s textbook screening It ordered the ministry to pay him $ 711. <PERSON> Iyenaga </PERSON>, who writes textbooks, plans to appeal to the High Court, said district court spokesman <PERSON> Akira </PERSON> <PERSON> Saito </PERSON>. <PERSON> Iyenaga </PERSON>, 76, had demanded $ 14,235 and wanted the screening system overturned. His complaint dealt mainly with government-ordered rewrites concerning <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s actions in World War II. The court rejected that portion of his argument. However, Judge <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> abused its inspection authority and contradicted mainstream academic theories in ordering <PERSON> Iyenaga </PERSON> to rewrite part of a 1980 textbook dealing with an attempted coup by farmers against the <ORGANIZATION> Tokugawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shogunate </ORGANIZATION> government in 1868. The court ruled against <PERSON> Iyenaga </PERSON> on his complaints that in writing textbooks, he could not use the terms `` invasion,'' `` <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> massacre,'' `` No. 731 regiment'' and `` battle in <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>'' in describing wartime actions by Japanese troops. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says more than 300,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed or raped by Japanese soldiers in December 1937 after <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>, then <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s capital, fell to Japanese invasion forces. Western historians have estimated that 200,000 were killed in the massacre. The Battle of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> in 1945 was <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s last and bloodiest stand during World War II. Okinawan officials said Japanese troops killed 800 Okinawan civilians because they were an obstacle to military operations and ordered others to commit suicide. No. 731 regiment refers to a unit alleged to have conducted germ experiments on war prisoners. <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> said textbook inspection was justified to preserve accuracy and neutrality in education. He held that textbook inspection does not violate the constitutional right to freedom of expression because material rejected by the ministry still can be published. He said in his ruling, `` Considering students' inability to evaluate educational contents, the little choice of educational tools allowed to teachers, and the need for equal opportunity for education, the government can not allow teachers complete freedom to publish their own studies as textbooks.'' Education Minister <PERSON> Kazuya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishibashi </PERSON> said in a statement, `` The adequacy and necessity of the textbook inspection system were reconfirmed by today's court ruling, and we in the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> will work even harder to make the contents of textbooks more satisfying. He said, however, that he objected to the payment and said the government might appeal. <PERSON> Iyenaga </PERSON> told reporters, `` We are very disappointed by the ruling. But the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> should take it seriously and blame itself for having gone too far in its censorship. `` I am also disappointed by the court's backward and biased attitude.'' The suit, filed in 1984, was <PERSON> Iyenaga </PERSON>'s third against the screening system.

 An <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> tropical depression that forecasters originally feared might strengthen into a tropical storm broke up Tuesday. `` I do n't think we're going to have to worry about it any longer,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Molleda </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. At 6 p.m. EDT, forecasters said the latest satellite pictures showed the depression was no longer identifiable due the strong upper level winds that developed over the system throughout the preceeding 12 hours. No more advisories would be issued on the system unless it regenerated, which was not expected, the center reported. The depression, the 13th of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season, formed Monday. Forecasters earlier had warned the system could intensify to tropical storm strength by Tuesday. At noon EDT, the system had top sustained winds near 35 mph and was centered near 17 degrees north latitude and 50 degrees west longitude, about 800 miles east of the <LOCATION> Leeward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. When a system's maximum sustained winds reach 39 mph, it becomes a named storm, and is classified a hurricane at 74 mph. Hurricane Hugo was the eighth named storm and the fifth hurricane of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

 A sobbing <PERSON> Cyndy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> was released from jail Tuesday, one day after she was arrested for refusing to allow ex-husband <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> court-ordered visits with their two daughters. Ms. <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> climbed into a BMW automobile with her attorney at 2:20 p.m.. She did n't speak to a dozen reporters and camera crews awaiting her release from the <ORGANIZATION> Sybil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the county's jail for <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON>, a former baseball star, meanwhile, was `` somewhere in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'' with his two teen-age daughters, his lawyer said. They will stay with him through the week. Ms. <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> was released several hours after the <ORGANIZATION> 2nd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had `` abused its discretion'' by not granting her bail after it ordered her to jail Monday for contempt of court. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> had convicted her of violating a December 1988 order that required daughters <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, 13, and <PERSON> Krisha </PERSON>, 14, to spend every Tuesday afternoon and two weekends a month with their father. Ms. <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON>, a substitute on a Cable News Network talk show, was found guilty of 43 contempt of court violations. She was ordered to spend five days in jail, then return Nov. 3 for a hearing on an additional 126-day jail sentence and two years probation. <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON>, a first baseman who had an 18-year major league career with the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Padres </ORGANIZATION>, was divorced from Ms. <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> in 1981 and recently remarried.

 Shellfish harvesting was banned Tuesday and warnings were issued against swimming in ocean water and rivers choked with untreated sewage because of damage from Hurricane Hugo. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said he would ask for an investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s response to victims of the hurricane, but <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, wife of the vice president, said the agency had been unfairly criticized. Crews working to re-establish a land link between the barrier islands and the mainland hoped to raise the <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> Bridge back into place Wednesday during high tide. The bridge, tilted at a 45-degree angle, has rested in the <LOCATION> Intracoastal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Waterway </LOCATION> for 13 days since the hurricane struck. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, who last week called employees of <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> a `` bunch of bureaucratic jackasses,'' said he will ask the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' watchdog agency, to investigate <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>'s `` incompetent'' handling of disaster relief <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> is the agency responsible for coordinating federal aid in national disasters. The agency, with a budget of $ 600 million and 2,200 employees, reports directly to the president. `` <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> needs to find out why this agency could n't perform in an emergency,'' he said from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` That's <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>'s job; it's in the title. They're supposed to manage emergencies, not cause them.'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> criticized <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> for opening too few offices to handle disaster relief applications. About 10 offices are open in the 22 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> counties that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared disaster areas. <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> said he disagreed with <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>' assessment of the agency's response, but said he would welcome an investigation `` Our charter under law is for the long-term recovery and response to the situation,'' <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I believe we're doing that and under the circumstances doing it as fast as it can be expected to be done.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> to help at disaster and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> centers, also defended <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everyone's natural reaction is to want everything done yesterday,'' she said. But `` from what I've been able to observe, <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>, very frankly, got a bum rap.'' Sewage treatment plants in the area are only partially operational and are removing only 30 percent of the pollutants from sewage. When fully operational, about 95 percent of the pollutants are removed before the sewage is dumped into the ocean. `` The waters are turning black, and there are fish kills all over,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. The swimming advisory could last months and possibly affect next spring's tourist season. Some 10 million visitors were attracted last year to the Grand Strand, 60 miles of beach from <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> line, and accounted for an estimated 35 percent of the state's total tourism revenue of $ 4.7 billion, officials said The long-term effect on the shellfishing industry is `` going to be devastating,'' Fanning said. Shellfishing also is a multimillion-dollar industry in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Hurricane Hugo slammed into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Sept. 21 with 135 mph wind, killing at least 18 and leaving 50,000 homeless, 270,000 jobless, and homes, businesses, schools and municipal buildings damaged or destroyed as far inland as <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> and north to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. In all, 29 people were killed on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland. Damage in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> alone has been estimated at $ 3 billion or more, with crop damage placed at some $ 100 million. South of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, workers planned to float barges under the dangling section of the <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sawyer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> and use Wednesday morning's rising tide to help raise the bridge that connects Isle of Palms and <LOCATION> Sullivans </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to the mainland, said <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffennach </PERSON>. Then cranes will swing the bridge back into position. The bridge will be left in position for cars until experts determine if they can repair the swing mechanism that opens the bridge for boats on the Intracoastal Waterway. In <LOCATION> Murrells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION>, 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, author <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Spillane </PERSON> examined the wreckage of his home and office, where he has written detective novels since 1963. One section of a wall was gone, and first editions of his books, including `` I, The Jury,'' and `` My Gun is Quick,'' had disappeared. Also gone was a manuscript of a book in progress. `` Hey, not to worry,'' he said. `` You get a flat tire, you fix it, right? `` The missing manuscript? No big deal. I'll make it up in two weeks, ... maybe three. That's how long it takes to write a book.''

 Troops loyal to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriego </PERSON> put down an attempted coup by a small rebel force Tuesday, retaking the headquarters of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> after a six-hour gunfight. `` This incident corresponds to the permanent aggression of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces against the tranquillity of our country. The proof is that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces closed access routes to the barracks,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said in a television statement from <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> headquarters after the fighting sputtered to an end. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> later stepped out of his headquarters with several fellow officers and waved to reporters but made no statement. The rebels `` surrendered to General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in person,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>. He said `` more than 60'' rebel troopers and four or five officers had been detained. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> serves as both the military and police and has a total strength of about 15,000 members. Rebel troops seized the headquarters in an attack launched around 7 a.m. but failed to capture <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Troops loyal to the general, who commands the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and controls the government, launched a counterattack and by 1 p.m. the shooting had tapered off as <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s backers gained the upper hand. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> appeared on television around 4 p.m. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has been trying to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> since he was indicted nearly two years ago in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug charges, denied any involvement in the coup attempt. The uprising was launched by junior <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> officers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zone </ORGANIZATION> took up positions about 600 yards from the headquarters, placed between the fighting at the compound and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installations at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION> and Quarry Heights. However, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said the American troops took no part in the fighting and were dispatched for security reasons. It was the second time in 18 months that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had survived a coup attempt by his own officers. In a radio broadcast after the rebels seized the headquarters the insurgents claimed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been ousted, but loyal forces soon took control of the broadcast networks. `` We want to underline that the situation in the country has been duly controlled to guarantee the peace and tranquillity that the state should assure for its citizens,'' said a statement released by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and Interior Minister <PERSON> Olmedo </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>. It declared an 8 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew and said the news media could report only official statements on the revolt. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, an opposition candidate for vice president in the May 7 election, was interviewed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and asked about the foiled coup. `` I think <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s going to get stronger regarding the Panamanian people,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. `` He's been holding them hostage for the last two years. International observers at the May 7 balloting said the opposition slate won by a substantial margin but the Noriega-controlled government annulled the election. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s provisional president, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the attempted coup against his government had been crushed. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, in his midafternoon address, did not accuse the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of complicity in the revolt but said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had undermined his nation with `` financial terrorism, economic blackmail and political interference.'' A small group of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> had tried to overthrow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in March 1988, but that attempt also was crushed quickly by forces loyal to the general. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been been applying pressure on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, including economic sanctions, in an effort to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down. The rebels' claimed in a broadcast around noon that they had overthrown <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and retired top officers, but that communique was not repeated. An officer loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> later said the general was at an undisclosed location controlling the operations against the insurgents. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday afternoon in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that officials had heard early `` rumblings'' of the uprising. He said later it appeared that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s forces `` are back in control.'' A communique by loyalists, read over Channel 2 television, said, `` The nationalist officers of all ranks and in all the barracks countrywide have confirmed their loyalty to the fatherland ... and to our Commander-in-Chief Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' `` The few who allowed themselves to fall prey to cowardice, to foreign money and to treason are a minority who advocated foreign intervention,'' the communique added. `` In the next few hours, this group will appear before justice, covered with shame.'' Several ambulances were seen leaving the area, and witnesses said there were some dead and wounded, but the number of casualties was not immediately known. Troops of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> were put on <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alert </ORGANIZATION>, the highest level of readiness. About 12,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers are stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, many within five miles of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. All <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> civilian dependents were moved onto <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations July 1 because of violence that followed Panamanian elections held May 7. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> nullified the results of the vote, which showed the opposition winning. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` There were rumors around that this was some American operation, and I can tell you that is not true. Nobody's sure what's happening there.'' Rebels managed to gain control of the military headquarters in a congested part of downtown <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Those loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> then went to the roofs of surrounding buildings, hurling grenades and firing mortars and small arms into the compound. Several hours of gunfire inside and outside the headquarters preceded the rebel broadcast that said the entire high command was forced into retirement by middle-ranking officers led by Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giraldi </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Urraca </LOCATION> battalion that handles security at Defense Forces headquarters. The radio said the communique announcing a coup was signed by <PERSON> Giraldi </PERSON>, Capt. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Licona </PERSON> of the cavalry and Capt. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Balma </PERSON> of the special forces. `` This is strictly a military movement. There is no politics involved,'' the communique said, referring to the civilian opposition alliance that has been trying to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help. An hour after the statement was read, a man who identified himself as Lt. Col. <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castrejon </PERSON>, said on pro-Noriega Channel 2 television that loyalists `` were ready to give their lives to defend Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. This is a betrayal.'' <PERSON> Castrejon </PERSON>, who identified himself as a spokesman for pro-Noriega forces, said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remained in control of air and naval units and of Battalion 2000, a special unit created to defend the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> after it is turned over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Dec. 31, 1999. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> inherited command of the military from Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, who seized power in 1968 and was killed in a plane crash in 1981. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> claims the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges of drug trafficking and money laundering are part of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plot to abrogate the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties of 1977.

<HEAD>Wounded Salvadoran Guerrillas Seek Asylum At Mexican Embassy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Forty-eight wounded guerrillas, most of them amputees, moved Tuesday to the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> from the Metropolitan Cathedral they had occupied for six weeks. The occupation began Aug. 20 with eight wounded entering the church and the number had reached 48 by last weekend, annoying both the rightist government of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leaders. `` The cathedral is not a hotel,'' Monsignor <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said late last month in an appeal to vacate the church. The guerrillas had said they would stay in the cathedral until they and wounded comrades on battlefronts were given safe conduct out of the country for medical treatment. But <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON>' chagrin apparently changed their minds. Red Cross vans took the 46 men and two women from the cathedral to the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. One man who said he lost his right arm in combat, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> through the embassy gate the wounded will not comment on future plans until arrangements were worked out with the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> ambassador. Access to the embassy was barred. Repeated telephone calls went unanswered. Earlier, insurgents denounced <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s speech Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in which he called for a cease-fire in the 10-year-old civil war. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who took office June 1, said his government would propose a complete cessation of hostilities during peace talks with rebels scheduled for Oct. 16-17 in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, umbrella for five guerrilla groups, has insisted an agreement must be reached on democratic reforms before the war can end. <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON>, a rebel negotiator, said, `` We want democracy and peace. It must be in that order, because if peace comes before democracy, it will be the peace of the cemetery.'' The rebels demand an end to what they call official repression, an overhaul of the judiciary and reduction of the armed forces. `` <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> filled his speech with words like human rights, peace and democracy. At the same time what we're seeing is a wave of arrests of members of popular organizations ... tortures, disappearances and murders,'' said the rebels on their clandestine Radio Venceremos. Vice President <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON> told journalists Monday the call for a cease-fire `` is not a call for the surrender of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said a cessation of hostilities `` would create appropriate conditions for the search for lasting peace.'' The rebels observed an 11-day unilateral cease-fire between Sept. 13-23 for the preliminary talks. They accused the government of taking advantage of the truce to move forces into guerrilla-controlled zones and arrest leaders of labor and peasant organizations considered guerrilla fronts by authorities.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> became snarled late Tuesday in a fight over whether to authorize the use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops against Panamanian dictator <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges, as it debated legislation to bolster the war on drugs. `` We had a golden opportunity to help the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> rid themselves of a malignancy,'' Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, said as he offered his plan. His offering came as senators churned through a wide-ranging bill that would add hundreds of new agents, federal marshals and prosecutors to the war on drugs and place care of crack addicts under the Medicaid program. `` These amendments will lay the groundwork for a new, expanded drug control strategy,'' <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., said as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the additions Senators planned to put the finishing touches on the bill Wednesday. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' proposal would authorize the president to `` use the armed forces of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to secure the removal of General <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from his illegal control of the Republic of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> expressed concern about the measure, saying `` I wonder if it is so broad that we are authorizing the president to declare war.'' He said it was possible that `` the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> resolution might blush by comparison.'' The <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> resolution of 1965 led to escalation of the Vietnam War. The <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> proposal followed the failure of a coup attempt against him by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved drug bill provisions that would authorize $ 57 million for 1,000 new <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, $ 47.5 million for 250 Drug Enforcement agents in rural areas and $ 24 million for 313 additional posts in federal prosecutors' offices. It also would authorize more for judges, marshals and probation officers. The bill also would place treatment of crack cocaine users and perhaps other substance abusers under Medicaid, beginning a year from now, at a cost estimated by Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, at $ 300 million. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, the author of the provision, said the price tag would be comparatively low because care available for crack addicts is limited in any case. `` There is no treatment,'' he told reporters. The bill was designed to help implement President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s war on drugs. As it went into the hopper, the measure would have required drug testing of persons arrested, jailed and placed on probation or paroled. A state's failure to satisfy the attorney general about the extent of its testing program could have led to a cutoff of federal law enforcement funds. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, however, junked those provisions in favor of a plan by Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Bon </PERSON>, R-Mo., providing for a $ 5 million pilot program of testing federal prisoners to determine which procedures work best <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said lawmakers were leery of handing the attorney general the powers in the original plan. Senators worked late into the night, heaping additions of their own onto the bill, ranging from a study of the possibility of ending the use of disposable needles to earmarking forfeited drug funds to buy weapons and body armor for agents. `` We'll probably pass a lot of these things and then they will never see the light of day,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> floor leader. `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> wo n't let it happen'' and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> itself might have some second thoughts before final action, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said.

 Items found during in a search of the home of a man on trial for the rape and sexual mutilation of a 7-year-old boy can be admitted as evidence, a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge ruled Tuesday. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriner </PERSON>, 39, charged with attempted first-degree murder, first-degree assault and two counts of first-degree rape, understood his rights when he let police into his home on May 21, Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> ruled. <PERSON> Shriner </PERSON>, 39, described as mentally retarded man with a history of sexual violence against young people is charged with the May 20 attack in which the boy was choked, raped and his penis was cut off.

<HEAD>Ted Turner's TNT Network Turns One, Still Growing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tonight's `` Big Picture'' is a <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Clift </PERSON> film, `` The Search,'' made in 1948. Then comes another postwar film, `` Till the End of Time,'' a 1946 drama with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>. The Late, Late Show of a local TV station? No. It's tonight's prime-time fare on <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> _ which on Tuesday celebrated its first cable-TV birthday with little hoopla, a record of solid growth and anticipation of more. The brainchild and fourth network of cable wizard <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> arrived on Oct. 3, 1989, its basic fare classic and maybe-not-so-classic films of yesteryear and big-budget, made-for-cable movies. When it began amid considerable drumbeating and cable's first showing of `` Gone With the Wind,'' <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>, a 24-hour-a-day operation, had 17 million subscribers. Now, it says, the figure is up to 33 million. TNT is n't yet in the top 10 list of cable networks, a list led by mostly sports <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> with more than 52 million subscribers. `` We still have a way to go to catch up with the leaders,'' concedes <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>'s boss. `` But we feel there's plenty of growth left,'' adds <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, who as president of <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Networks </ORGANIZATION> is in charge of both <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION>, the latter <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s cable superstation in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Turner's other networks are the all-news <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and Headline News. <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>'s made-for-cable movies now include miniseries such as the just-concluded three-part historical drama, `` Captain <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>,'' and last month's four-part `` The Nightmare Years,'' based on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirer </PERSON>'s memoirs about <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> during <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s rise to power. Early examples of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>'s `` made-fors,'' as TV movies are called, included <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> in `` A Man For All Seasons,'' and a drama with <PERSON> Farrah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawcett </PERSON> as the celebrated news photographer <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourke-White </PERSON>. Costing an average of $ 3 million each, the movies initially bowed on a one-a-month basis. The premieres this month went to a two-a-month basis, and, a spokeswoman says, will go up to three a month by October next year, and four each month in 1991. Although <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>'s target audience is in the 25-54 age range, the network does have younger-viewer fare in the morning and early evening _ reruns of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s acclaimed `` The Muppet Show'' series and `` Fraggle Rock.'' It also is edging into sports, with more than 70 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> games slotted for this winter. During the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> says, it will air 50 live hours from each Games under a $ 50 million deal Turner struck last month with CBS Sports. But what <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> calls `` the heart and soul'' of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> is its huge library of <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> RKO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> and pre-1950 <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> films, more than 3,300 movies that range from `` Casablanca'' to `` The Prisoner of Zenda.'' `` We run 250 films a month,'' says <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, who praises <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mateas </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>'s scheduling director, as close to a genius in the way she schedules the movies, of which new prints have been made and sound tracks restored. Sometimes, he says, she schedules two or three titles together to show stages of development of a particular player, such as <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, or to show a yesteryear star, such as <PERSON> Myrna </PERSON> <PERSON> Loy </PERSON>, to a new generation of film fans. Sometimes her scheduling also displays a pixie sense of humor. One night last year offered a TNT triple-feature: `` He Could n't Say No,'' `` She Could n't Say No,'' and `` She Had to Say Yes.'' `` She's just magic,'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> says. TNT may be a treasure trove for movie buffs. But the size of its average audience each night poses no major threat yet to the major networks. Its much-publicized `` <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourke-White </PERSON>'' last April got <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>'s highest ratings to date, a 5.1. That works out to just over 2.5 million homes, which is very good for cable, but relatively small potatoes by network standards. Still, <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>'s growth and acceptance by viewers have impressed even a top cable executive who once was what he calls a `` nay-sayer'' to <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>, partly because he did n't think its film library would prove that big a draw. `` I thought we should have stayed back and waited a year to see what happened,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Clasen </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Comcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest cable companies. But <ORGANIZATION> Comcast </ORGANIZATION>, which is based near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and, according to <PERSON> Clasen </PERSON>, serves 2.4 million subscribers, decided to take a chance. It offered the new TNT service as part of a promotional strategy last fall. The network `` was very successful, very well-received'' by subscribers of cable systems <ORGANIZATION> Comcast </ORGANIZATION> owns or manages, he says. He sees little that could stop <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>'s growth. He also is, he says, `` completely sold'' on Turner's long-range goal for the network: one major event each night that is the centerpiece of the night's program. `` This is the cable era where people do n't watch channels anymore,'' <PERSON> Clasen </PERSON> says. `` They look at individual products. They want to be sure there's something significant to watch when they tune in.''

 When the subject of affordable housing is discussed, which is often, most recommendations offered seem to involve the federal government in some capacity. It is an old tradition, part of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> culture, exemplified by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> mortgage programs, by tax-favored building programs, and by income tax breaks for homeowners. Homeownership is sacred. Ask any homebuilder or real estate group and they'll claim that homeowners are hardworking, community spirited, highly responsible, and dutiful voters. And, as they say in the real estate ads, much, much more. Homeowners, they might add, are the embodiment of the American spirit of independence, creativity and opportunity. A high level of homeownership, they point out, distinguishes <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from so many other countries. But when the subject is affordable housing, many housing people habitually turn to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a solution, citing figures that show the typical new house is priced beyond the means of the typical income family. Meanwhile, many young couples are, in effect, saying so what, and are managing to buy suitable houses by means of old-fashioned ingenuity, a quality often available to those who need to tap it. Among their devices is that of obtaining financial assistance from the seller. Sellers who have owned their houses for many years generally have built up sizable equity. They have money to invest. Many of them also are contemplating retirement, and wondering about a retirement income. To extend a purchase loan, a second mortgage, might be considered an opportunity by them. Both rate and security are A-1. The device is commonly used but not nearly as commonly recommended. But thousands of young couples are in homes of their own today because of it. And all they did was ask. Others are buying homes in need of repairs. The house is n't the place of their dreams but, submitting to reality, they recognize it is the best they can do. They buy, and using brains and backs, create the house of their dreams. In so doing, they create equity too, almost always adding more to their assets than the couple who postpone buying while attempting to save enough for a dream house in the future. One couple has a house, the other a forlorn dream. Others tip the price scale in their favor by moving farther out from core cities, while others push deeper into the cores, even into slums, in search of prices within their means. It's a start, they reason. Better times will come. Indeed, they usually do. Whatever they manage to buy, assuming they exercised prudence, the new homeowners are likely to find the market value higher in the future. The increases might be modest, maybe averaging just a few percentage points a year, but that's better than in most investments. Homeowners may put up only 20 percent of the purchase price but they take 100 percent of the appreciation. True, prices might stagnate in the future; conceivably, they could even drop. But over periods of a decade or more it is relatively rare for houses to lose market value. Real estate is cyclical, but the price trend is up. Houses that could n't be sold eight years ago in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> now might be available for double their old price. Since 1986, the median sale price of existing single-family homes there has risen more than $ 15,000. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where in middecade the market had dropped drastically, the median price in the second quarter of 1989 was 8.2 percent higher than a year earlier. Prices are up in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> again. And in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> too. And those who scrimped, struggled, sacrificed and innovated in order to buy those houses are reaping the benefits now, without help from Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>.

 The unassuming facade of The Observatory gave no hint of the significance of what was inside. But like a good book, <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Longenbaugh </PERSON>'s bookstore could not be judged by its cover. Inside was a collection that had become a treasure to book and map collectors worldwide. <PERSON> Longenbaugh </PERSON>'s specialty is `` Alaskana'' _ books, maps and prints that tell of the Last Frontier's colorful past. The treasure still exists, but not in this scenic fishing port and mill town along southeast <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s rain forest coast. <LOCATION> Sitka </LOCATION> and its 8,000 residents recently lost the best collection of literary Alaskana to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> For <LOCATION> Longenbaugh </LOCATION>, 55, the move south represents a return to her roots. She grew up in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` It's very, very interesting, because I have lived in <LOCATION> Sitka </LOCATION> for 26 years,'' she said. `` So am I still a northern New Mexican? Am I an Alaskan? Do n't know. Got ta go down and find out.'' <LOCATION> Longenbaugh </LOCATION> does n't plan to open her new store until later this year. But she expects it will offer more space than the cramped quarters of her <LOCATION> Sitka </LOCATION> shop, where the lack of order was enough to make a librarian faint. Thousands of books were crammed on shelves, stacked on the floor and buried under desks _ everywhere except on a narrow ribbon of linoleum that snaked through the shop's two small rooms. The hand-printed signs that separated the books by subject did little to alleviate the disheveled appearance. <PERSON> Longenbaugh </PERSON>'s passion for out-of-print books long ago overcame any passing interest in library science `` I'm at the other end of the spectrum from the book dealer who has thousands of volumes and knows where every one is,'' she said recently before the move. <PERSON> Longenbaugh </PERSON> began to turn her love for books and fascination with polar-region history into a business 13 years ago. Her children were growing up and she was looking for something fun and profitable to do with her time. She started trading books from her home on a tiny island off <LOCATION> Sitka </LOCATION>'s waterfront, but soon realized she needed a store. In 1977, she rented a small house on a back street and converted it into The Observatory with 343 out-of-print books on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Today she has about 3,000 volumes on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, 6,000 on other subjects, 2,200 historic prints and maps, and dozens of reference books. She began trading in maps and prints in 1979 after a buying trip to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` I kept noticing in little towns there would be a little print and map shop,'' she recalled. `` I thought, ` Gosh, I wonder if anybody in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> would be interested in old maps of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>?''' They were. Alaskans comprised about 50 percent of <PERSON> Longenbaugh </PERSON>'s clientele About 40 percent were from other states and about 10 percent traded from overseas. With virtually no advertising, the self-taught historian-bookseller built an international business. She remains somewhat perplexed about how she became so well-known among book and map collectors. `` I do n't know,'' she said. `` Word of mouth, I think.'' Although <PERSON> Longenbaugh </PERSON> hopes to `` go upmarket somewhat'' with her <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> store, she easily resists being stereotyped as a highfalutin trader of rare books and maps. `` On purpose I run a democratic bookstore. My idea is that you can come into the shop and you may not see anything you like, and you can leave, but I do n't want you to say, ` There was n't anything in that place I could afford.' `` Good reading is good reading,'' she said. `` If it's an old library discard, that's OK _ the content is still perfectly good and it's fun to read.'' <PERSON> Longenbaugh </PERSON> also rejects the notion that booksellers should n't specialize in their favorite subjects `` The rule of thumb goes, you are never, never to deal in a specialty where you yourself collect, because you will cheat your customers by grabbing off the good stuff. `` My feeling is, if I dealt with something that bored me I would n't enjoy doing it. Sure, I take one now and then. But I always figure, there's another copy out there. The customer can have the next one.'' A friendly woman with a hearty laugh and insatiable curiosity, she revels in playing detective for customers seeking a particular out-of-print book. `` It's just so much fun,'' she said. `` Lots of dealers do n't like to do book searches because they are so time consuming I charge a dollar and a half, and I'm sure I spend a lot more than that.'' Her <LOCATION> Sitka </LOCATION> customers now have to request that service by mail. They also can no longer hear her classical music show on the local public radio station, or enjoy her narration of the station's daily soap opera. `` People like <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> are irreplaceable,'' said <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON>, program director for KCAW-FM. `` Her particular combination of personality and talent is something that is rare even in a big city, let alone in a town our size.'' <LOCATION> Longenbaugh </LOCATION> is touched by such sentiment. `` Bless their hearts, everybody's being really regretful. `` And I'm so pleased, because think how horrible it would be to live in a place so many years and have nobody care when you took off.''

 It's horseshoes instead of horseback riding, the movies are newer and the guest list is longer as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> settles in at the weekend White House in the <LOCATION> Catoctin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. In 37 weekends of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidency, he has been to `` the camp'' 20 times. Six weekends have been spent at his oceanfront home in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. His stays at Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON> usually begin with a jog, aides say. Saturdays will typically include more athletic endeavors _ jogging, tennis, swimming, horsehoe pitching and `` wally ball,'' a form of vollyeball played on a squash court _ and work in his office. Sundays, he attends interdenominational church services along with personnel from the camp, which is operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> routinely accompanies her husband to the retreat. `` She reads a lot, does her mail, takes work with her up there,'' says <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, the first lady's press secretary. `` If her husband is having guests and they bring the spouses along, which happens quite a bit, she'll maybe go bowling with the spouses. She always goes swimming when she's up there. They play tennis. It's a quiet time for her.'' As was the case when <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used the camp, Friday and Saturday nights are often devoted to films in the camp's movie theater The Reagans, with backgrounds in the golden age of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, preferred old movies. The Bushes' taste runs to newer offerings. Last weekend, they watched `` Sea of Love'' and `` <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used Camp David 187 times _ more than any other president since <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> had it built in 1942. Weekends for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> were usually quiet times spent without family or other visitors. `` It was a place that the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> enjoyed to be alone together and to unwind and to be away from the pressures of the gilded cage of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' says <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, a spokesman for the former president in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' son, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON>, who visited the camp several times with his wife, <PERSON> Doria </PERSON>, said the routine was to `` sleep late, depending on the weather, take a swim, have a ride, come back, hang out and probably see a movie in the evening after dinner.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> has said she visited the camp only once. His other daughter, <PERSON> Patti </PERSON>, was estranged from her parents for much of the administration. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON>, parents of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' only grandchildren, were living in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and did not visit the camp For the Bushes, in contrast, weekends at Camp David often bring gatherings of family and friends. The first family's newest grandchild, <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, came to Camp David on Easter, less than two months after she was born in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>. The older grandchildren enjoy riding around the camp in golf carts. `` You see grandkids putting around all the time,'' says one aide who has accompanied the Bushes to the retreat 65 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. One weekend, the president invited <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON> and a group for a weekend of tennis. Even foreign dignitaries have spend the night. Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> was there in February, Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> went in June and <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> was there last weekend. One more thing: There is now a <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> game at Camp David.

<HEAD>Merger Activity Slows in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of mergers and acquisitions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> trailed off during the third quarter, although the dollar value of those deals was up, according to a financial research company. <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mondat </PERSON> that 334 acquisitions of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies worth $ 114.7 billion were announced during the third quarter. That compared with 357 transactions worth $ 92.3 billion in the first quarter, and 378 deals worth $ 75 billion in the second quarter. Merger and acquisition activity has slowed as prices for companies has gone up and financing has been harder to come by. The big banks that finance deals have become more cautious, and investors are also more wary. In reaching its totals, <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> included acquisitions of majority and entire interests in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms, recapitalizations, spinoffs, self-tenders and exchange offers for stock or securities convertible into stock. Each transaction was worth $ 10 million or more. The figures included several major deals, including the planned $ 11.4 billion merger of <ORGANIZATION> Bristol-Myers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Squibb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the proposed $ 3.6 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the planned $ 4.7 billion merger of <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Sovran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. They also included the approximately $ 5.5 billion in divestitures announced by <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> following its own $ 24.53 billion buyout earlier this year. So far in 1989, there have been 1,140 transactions totaling $ 302.5 billion, down 14 percent from the 1,256 deals totaling $ 353.1 billion during the first nine months of 1988, according to <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, N.J.-based Securities Data. The company's figures also indicate a slowing in leveraged buyouts, those made with largely borrowed funds. Leveraged buyouts declined to 24 deals totaling $ 19.9 billion in the third quarter, compared with 47 deals worth $ 18.3 billion in the first quarter and 56 transactions totaling $ 19.6 billion in the second quarter. For the year to date, there have been 132 LBOs totaling $ 57.7 billion, down sharply from 183 buyouts totaling $ 73.3 billion in the same period a year earlier. LBO activity is expected to continue to decline because of uncertainty in junk bonds, a popular form of financing for leveraged buyouts. The junk bond market suffered heavy losses last month after <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced it was having difficulty meeting interest payments on some of its bonds. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, which relied heavily on junk bonds for its $ 6.6 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> last year, has received a $ 250 million loan from <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> so it could make its payments. <ORGANIZATION> IDD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, another financial information concern, also reported a slowing of merger activity during the first three quarters of the year. IDD, which tallied merger and acquisition activity around the world, said 3,666 targets worth $ 248.53 billion were acquired during the first nine months of 1989, down from 4,171 targets worth $ 248.57 billion. The company noted that the 1989 dollar amount was swelled by the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> deal. Without that transaction, the drop in terms of dollars would have been sharper.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s 1990 model cars will cost an average of 4.9 percent more than comparably equipped 1989 vehicles, the company announced. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that nearly half of the increase _ 2.1 percent _ was due to government-required passive safety devices, either driver-side air bags or automatic seat belts. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has announced a 3.4 percent average increase in the retail prices of its 1990 cars. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which will announce its figures within two weeks, has estimated its increase will be about 5 percent. Each of the Big Three automakers blamed air bags and automatic seat belts for large portions of the price increases. All of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s U.S.-built cars, about 1 million vehicles, will be equipped with driver-side air bags. About 500,000 <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> cars will have them and about 1 million <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and Mercury cars will be equipped with the devices. Executives of each of the Big Three have said that air bags add between $ 400 and $ 1,000 to the cost of a car. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> began taking orders on 1990 cars based on pre-introduction prices set in August. Those who already have ordered 1990 Ford Thunderbird, Festiva and Tempo and Mercury Cougar and <PERSON> Topaz </PERSON> cars will get rebates, since the retail price announced Monday is lower than the pre-introduction prices of those models, spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupp </PERSON> said. He said other retail prices were the same as pre-introductory quotes and some were higher. Those customers will not have to pay more. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> already have announced incentive plans for some of their 1990 model cars and trucks, which would soften the impact of the passive restraint systems.

 The 2,000 employees at <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s successful computer-manufacturing division were n't surprised when they heard part of the company was being sold.

One alleged fraud involved $ 200,000 from an elderly widow the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said represented the proceeds from the sale of her home. The lawsuit claims <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> invested only $ 80,000 of the woman's money and told her the remaining $ 120,000 was safely invested, despite discrepancies on her account statement. According to the lawsuit, <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> deposited $ 131,000 into three accounts to satisfy gambling debts. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said it is unaware of reasons for the remaining deposits. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, 28, worked at a <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, office of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> from June 1983 to August 1987 and at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> from August 1987 to April 1988, the lawsuit states. None of the allegedly fraudulent transactions occurred while <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> worked at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit states that <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> misappropriated an estimated $ 503,000 from customer accounts and seeks the full amount to be reimbursed. According to the complaint, <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> received individual orders ranging from $ 3,000 to $ 120,000 for basic brokerage accounts that included a choice of money funds and a checking account and bank card. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> charged that <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> simply did not open accounts for customers who gave him money and deposited checks into his own or other accounts. In some cases, he allegedly debited customer margin accounts to account for transactions. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Yager </PERSON> said the firm discovered discrepancies in <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s accounts after he left the firm and reported them to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, criminal agencies and <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yager </PERSON> said all <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> clients were reimbursed for losses. A telephone message left for a <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> was not immediately returned. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> names the allegedly defrauded clients as well as the alleged recipients of their money, including those <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> allegedly paid off gambling debts.

<HEAD>Say Consumer Confidence Stabilized in September After August Retreat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer confidence in the economy steadied last month after dropping sharply in August, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in a survey that suggested a recession is unlikely for the forseeable future. The business research organization's Consumer Confidence Index totaled 115.4 in September, the same as a month earlier, the group said Monday. The July figure was 120.4. The index, covering 5,000 households nationwide, is a measurement of consumer trust in the economic future, based on buying plans, job availability and general business conditions. It is based on a 1985 base year of 100. `` The sustained high level of public confidence, despite some indications that business activity may be slowing, is encouraging,'' <PERSON> Fabian </PERSON> <PERSON> Linden </PERSON>, executive director of the board's <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said in a press release `` Recent consumer survey findings do not show the slightest signs of recession,'' he said. `` The strong employment situation, the benign pace of inflation, and receding interest rates add up to a comfortable economic environment for the consumer.'' The survey showed that nearly 27 percent of respondents thought business conditions were good, roughly the same as a month earlier. But opinion on job availability declined, with 30 percent of respondents describing employment as plentiful, vs. 31.6 percent in August and about 33 percent in July. Homebuying plans declined slightly in September, with 2.9 percent of respondents saying they intended to purchase a home, vs. 3.5 percent a month earlier. But plans to purchase cars rose to 7.8 percent of respondents, vs. 7.4 percent in August, 7.1 percent in July and 6.7 percent in June. Consumer behavior is scrutinized by forecasters because it can provide important evidence on the direction of the economy. Consumerism accounts for a majority of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic activity. The <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is a worldwide business network of companies from more than 50 countries, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 An investor group says it had bought a 6.24 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Harley-Davidson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the motorcycle manufacturer that used protective tariffs in the early 1980s to beat back Japanese competition. In a filing Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, N.Y, investor and businessman, said he had purchased 488,200 shares, or 5.7 percent of <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>'s common stock. The filing also stated that <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>'s six children _ <PERSON> Avram </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Darcie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> _ each controlled 8,500 shares of <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> for a family total of 6.24 percent. <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> last year acquired 9.9 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> Formica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> at $ 12 a share and was rebuffed in a $ 20-a-share buyout offer before the laminated products company went private in a management-led deal for $ 19 a share. `` We invest in companies which we feel are significantly undervalued, are leaders in their field, have strong brand name recognition and exhibit tremendous future growth potential,'' <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> said in a statement. `` <LOCATION> Harley </LOCATION> - <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> fits all these categories. <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which he said has interests in more than 30 companies in 12 states, including network-affiliated television stations, real estate, health care and banking, with assets of more than $ 200 million. First Allied in 1984 offered $ 7.6 billion to buy <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing on <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> group had `` no definitive plans at this time'' for their shares but `` are currently evaluating their respective positions.'' The filing, however, said they may seek to acquire a controlling interest or sell off all or part of their shares. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> stock fell 50 cents to $ 39.12 -LCB- in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Monday. Milwaukee-based <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>, the producer of big, distinctive motorcycles featured in such movies as `` Easy Rider'' and favored by many law enforcement agencies, is the only U.S.-based motorcycle manufacturer. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1983 imposed five years of stiff tariffs against imported motorcycles that had been beating <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>'s own product The tariffs were removed in 1987 after the company announced it no longer needed the protection. `` In the early'80s, the company was being badly beaten by the Japanese,'' <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> said. `` Today, however, the <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> factory ca n't produce enough motorcycles to meet the overwhelming consumer demand. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> reported second-quarter profits of $ 10.9 million, or $ 1.26 a share, on sales of $ 234 million. The filing listed the occupation of <PERSON> Darcie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> as students while their brothers were listed as `` assistant to Malcolm I. <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>.'' The filing said <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> personally purchased 409,800 shares for $ 13.7 million _ $ 3.47 million of it from his personal funds. Another $ 376,000 was obtained through a loan from <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> that has since been paid. The rest of the money to buy the stock, $ 10.3 million, `` is expected to be obtained through a combination of Mr. <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>'s personal funds and a loan or loans from <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION>'' under terms similar to the previous promissory note <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> signed The younger <ORGANIZATION> Glazers </ORGANIZATION> bought their shares for totals ranging from $ 234,572 to $ 235,697, all financed by loans from <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION>, according to the filing.

 Former Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrat who resigned his congressional seat in June amid allegations of financial impropriety, says he is joining a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banking firm. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s appointment as a partner in the firm <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Schroder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was announced Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the firm, which also has offices in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The former majority whip, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> was the No. 3 leadership official in the House. He announced his resignation May 26 after it was revealed he had failed to report a $ 50,000 loan from a savings and loan whose chief executive had set him up in a junk bond deal financed by the loan. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> maintains that the deal was proper and that his only mistake had been an accounting oversight. But the resulting controversy threatened to damage his run for majority leader, the No. 2 House post, and he stepped down effective June 15 rather than subject his party to further ethics problems. `` I do n't know the business,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said of his new job, but added: `` I'm excited because it gives me an opportunity to grow.'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said he would be working in the areas of mergers and acquisitions and asset managment in the company's foreign operations, offering strategic advice and pursuing new clients for the firm.

<HEAD>Ability of Typical American Family to Buy a Home Rises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An index measuring the ability of the typical American family to buy a home rose in August to the highest level in four months, a housing industry group said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said Monday its index rose to 102.2, meaning that a family with a median income of $ 32,992 had 102.2 percent of the income needed to buy a median-priced existing home costing $ 94,900. The association said the increase reflects both falling home prices and mortgage interest rates. It was the highest level since the index read 103.2 in April. The median means that half of the families earn more and half less, or that half the homes sell for more and half for less. The <ORGANIZATION> NAR </ORGANIZATION> said the median price for existing homes fell from $ 96,700, while interest rates dropped from 10.39 percent to 10.11 percent. It also said a $ 116 increase in the median income also helped raise the index. The association uses a composite rate reflecting both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages. The changes lowered the monthly principal and interest payment on a median home by $ 29 to $ 672, which represents 24.5 percent of the median family's income. By region, the median family in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> had 134.4 percent of the income needed to purchase a median-priced home; Southern families had 101.3 percent; Western families, 75.0 percent, and residents of the Northeast, 72.5 percent. Realtors President <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON> said that while the index reflects improved overall buying conditions, it masks the difficulty first-time buyers continue to experience. `` In expensive areas, home prices are so out of sync with incomes that renters with no equity are pushed out of the buying market,'' he said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Entrepreneur <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> says he has sold a 25 percent stake in his <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Fujisankei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> for $ 150 million. The stake would be the largest holding by a Japanese company in an existing British concern, Virgin Music said. The announcement Monday followed last week's news that <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for $ 3.4 billion. It also marks a trend of corporate takeovers in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> entertainment industry, especially by foreign firms. Virgin Music and the media conglomerate Fujisankei, through its subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Pony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, plan to launch a new record label in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to promote sales of top British pop artists in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Virgin Music's lineup includes singers <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldfield </PERSON>, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, Simple Minds, <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, UB40 and <PERSON> Boy </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, many of them already popular in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` We could not have hoped for a better partner than Fuji,'' <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> said. `` They do n't think just short term.'' Virgin Music `` consciously chose a partnership which would not only ensure our future independence under existing management, but would provide a springboard for our ambitions to become the world's No 1 music group,'' he said. <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> took Virgin Music private last year, saying he was n't happy with the stock market's valuation of the shares, which were sold to the public in 1986 Virgin Music had revenue of $ 400 million in 1988, making it the sixth largest record company in the world, the company said. <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> also owns <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, a cut-rate trans-Atlantic airline. <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> is the latest of independent record labels to be snapped up recently by big corporations, following a trend in the music, film and television business. Dutch-owned <ORGANIZATION> Polygram </ORGANIZATION> currently is in talks to purchase <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' A & amp; M Records, <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Alpert </PERSON>'s label, for a reported $ 500 million. In other deals in recent years, <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> Motown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> for $ 61 million and Thorn-EMI of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> paid about $ 80 million for a 50 percent stake in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chrysalis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. The consolidation trend intensified this summer when <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Polygram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> unit bought independent Island Records for what analysts estimated was $ 300 million A still-independent major label belongs to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Geffen </PERSON>. But it is closely allied with <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s record unit, which was one of the chief attractions in <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 14 billion merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> in July. Among big labels, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> was snapped up by <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> was bought by <ORGANIZATION> Bertelsman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Bucking the trend was <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Azoff </PERSON>, who announced in August he was leaving <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> to start his own label. <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> is negotiating with <PERSON> Azoff </PERSON> to help fund the deal in a setup like the <PERSON> Geffen </PERSON>'s with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Azoff </PERSON> estimated it would take $ 75 million to $ 100 million in funding to launch an independent record label, and said all five competing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> record distributors and several Wall Street investment groups have expressed interest in bankrolling him should the deal with <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> fail.

 His clients' industries read like an environmental hit list: nuclear energy, chemicals, hazardous waste disposal and lawn care. It's not surprising that <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> has made a big business out of crisis public relations. Companies that have turned to him for help include <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s chemical division and <ORGANIZATION> Chemlawn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He helped <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> pull out of the highly regulated <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> auto insurance market without incurring fines. And he represents <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>, operator of the troubled, overbudget <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, nuclear power plant. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s first job, of course, is to help such clients avoid debacles in the first place. `` We tell them, ` You live in a fishbowl today, and you have to expect everything you do and say is going to land on the front page of your newspaper,''' he said. `` You're not going to be able to go back to your boardroom and communicate with no one but your shareholders. Those days are gone.''' So when oil spills, radiation leaks or regulatory agencies sting, when government inspectors arrive to seize files and reporters descend to put tales of corporate wrongdoing on Page One, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> provides damage control. He prescribes an old-fashioned remedy newly in vogue in crisis-management public relations: Tell all. Apologize if necessary. Make amends before the government and the courts make them for you. `` Full disclosure is where it's at,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said recently. `` Drench any kind of a crisis and any kind of a difficult story in information Get it all out very quickly, and assume it's all going to come out in the end. He argues that stonewalling only encourages reporters to dig for themselves, with help from the corporation's foes. If a company gets the facts out fast, the media will quickly lose interest in the story. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s nemesis is the corporate attorney. When disaster strikes, attorneys frequently counsel executives to say as little as possible and especially not to apologize, lest those statements be used against them in a liability suit. `` Often times the attorney wins, and that leads to negative stories that run on for days,'' said <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 54, who cut his teeth in public relations as a utility company spokesman during the Arab oil embargo. `` Then eventually the company relents and decides to open up. But by that time so much damage has been done and they are so defensive that it usually works against them.'' Advice costs $ 50 to $ 200 an hour at <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s 5-year-old <ORGANIZATION> BMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>. Though he has been successful, his staff of 30 is up against tough competitors, including major law firms with more specializing in `` governmental relations.'' That can mean anything from lobbying lawmakers to negotiating with regulatory agencies to running interference with the media. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division, has launched a unit within the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Hale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Dorr </PERSON> representing companies or individuals who find themselves the targets of white collar crime investigations <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> agreed that candor usually pays. But he said he would advise the company to meet privately with government officials first. `` The worst thing, I think, for a company in trouble to do is for the CEO to go public and declare, ` We are blameless,' and then be left twisting in the wind as three weeks of negative details come out,'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said. But, he warned, `` You do n't want to take a shot into the unknown and make a statement which is essentially a guilty plea toward a felony without having some notion of what the government attitude is likely to be.'' <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON>, managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> Adams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> public relations agency in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the way a company responds to a crisis can influence prosecutor, judge and jury. `` Did the company try to cover up or did it act responsibly? Those are issues that are legitimately put before the court,'' <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON> said. Whether the public approves of a company's response to a disaster can affect the bottom line just as much as a lawsuit, she added. Because of <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s quick, candid and aggressive response to the Tylenol poisonings a few years ago, the market share of the painkiller actually increased after the incident, she said. But <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, widely faulted for its response to the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> oil spill, was threatened with a consumer boycott.

 <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is returning to its consumer-electronics roots with the proposed sale of its computer unit, but the future of the last major U.S.-based television maker remains fuzzy. Both the North American television market and the stock market appear to be friendly toward <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> at the moment. But experts say there are no guarantees that the high-definition television technologies to which <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> is committed will ever find a large market, or that <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> will be able to survive in a sea of hungry foreign competitors. `` It's a good company but it's not a good business,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Magid </PERSON>, an electronics-industry analyst with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Needham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc.. Glenview-based <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday it had agreed to sell its computer unit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> and would use the proceeds to lighten its debt load and sharpen its focus on new television The decision surprised some observers, since the company had long been rumored to be seeking a buyer for its consumer-electronics unit, by far the weaker of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s two major divisions. But <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> received only fire-sale prices for its television business, so it decided to sell its computer division instead, which makes personal and laptop models, Chairman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> told a news conference Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We are a highly leveraged company in two very tough businesses,'' he said. `` We could n't do either of them appropriate justice.'' <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s stock surged $ 3.25 to close at $ 17.25 a share Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> and industry analysts said the deal, valued at more than $ 600 million, would give <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> a solid financial base from which to continue battling foreign competitors. <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> estimated <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s total debt at $ 600 million. He said <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> will pay down all its short-term debt and a portion of its long-term debt with the money from the sale, leaving it with less than $ 50 million in proceeds to be used for other things. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> said it would use some of the cash from the sale to fund work on `` new consumer electronics and component technologies, particularly high-definition television and advanced high-resolution color displays.'' Analysts said high-definition television, which produces much sharper pictures than today's television screens, is something of a gamble given the unknown size of the market. `` HDTV is only one piece _ a futuristic piece _ of the consumer electronics pie,'' said analyst <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` And it's a piece of pie that has n't even been baked yet.'' Faced with the possibility of a foreign onslaught of <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> sets, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> proposed last year that the government take a major role in HDTV research in this country. But the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration now considers <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> just one of several telecommunications technologies worthy of federal support, said <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> denied any reduction in the administration's commitment to assist <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION>'s development `` There may appear to be less of a commitment only because <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> is now being considered along with the broader issue of telecommunications,'' she said. Another Zenith technology, the flat-tension-mask video monitor, is the industry standard in the portable computer field, analysts said, and would represent a significant improvement in television picture quality if it could be enlarged, with or without accompanying HDTV components. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> envisions the flat tension mask as one component of an HDTV system. The deal to sell the computer division, which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, was seen as a coup for Paris-based Bull, which will acquire <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s successful and highly regarded SupersPort line of laptop computers as part of the purchase. The 10-year-old computer division, which employs 4,000 of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s 37,000 workers, has been a bright performer for <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> during a decade that proved disastrous to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television industry. But television prices stabilized this year, halting an eight-year slide, and are expected to rise next year, due in part to a shortage of glass for picture tubes. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s computer sales have begun to sag. Last month, the company announced it was deferring employee raises as part of a cost-cutting program to combat losses from slack computer sales. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> turned a profit of $ 11.7 million last year after three years of widening losses, but had a net loss of $ 17 million for the first half of 1989.

 House leaders say the angry reaction of senior citizens toward the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic illness plan will push <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> away from addressing the major health needs of the elderly, perhaps for years. Catastrophic illness protection was considered one of the major achievements of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second term. But elderly groups have mobilized their members against it and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was on the brink of voting a repeal today. Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said Monday there was a `` mood of frustration'' among House members Most would want to let the dust settle before embracing any new comprehensive plans to provide catastrophic illness insurance or long-term care, he said. `` I think they -LRB- lawmakers -RRB- feel they'd just like to get rid of this annoyance and they certainly are going to be very skeptical when I come to them in the future with a bill to help the senior citizens,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Fortney </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health Stark and Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., were asking the House today to approve an amendment that would salvage a portion of the health program's benefits, including some coverage for prescription drugs <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said his chances, at best, were even. <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said supporters of the catastrophic care program `` lost the information battle'' to groups that preyed on the fears of the elderly. Many elderly were led by `` hysteria-mongers'' to believe their costs were astronomical and chances of benefits unlikely, he said. `` It's very easy to take very fragile, very insecure seniors who are easily confused and confuse them even further,'' he said. While the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has officially endorsed keeping the program, the president has avoided personal involvement with that politically unpopular stance. House Republicans have announced they will vote in a bloc to kill the plan, and say they have assurances <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would sign a repeal. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> position was `` to retain the benefits and mitigate the premium costs'' but it was n't endorsing any specific proposal. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leaders were n't taking an official stance either, although he personally supported the Stark-Waxman approach. `` If it is going to be meaningful up here, there must be some effort on the part of the president to persuade the members to cast their votes'' against repeal, he said. `` If he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- did half as much as he did on capital gains tax we'd have a real zinger tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said, referring to the president's victory last week on his tax cut proposal. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, while critical of the president for sitting out the controversy on catastrophic health care, said he was n't sure the White House could turn the tide at this point. The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act was aimed at protecting the elderly and disabled from financial ruin in the event of a prolonged hospital stay or other high medical costs. The program pays for unlimited approved hospitalization after a once-a-year deductible of $ 560 in 1989. Previously, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> charged a deductible for each hospital stay during a year and provided full payment of hospital bills only up to 59 days a year. The plan also limits the amount that beneficiaries must pay for hospital care, physician services, medical supplies and prescription drugs and expands other health care benefits as well. But the elderly, many of whom had some similar benefits from private insurance plans, objected to paying for the new federal coverage. The surtax could be as high as $ 800 this year and higher in the future for upper-income elderly.

<HEAD>New Owners Want Northwest To Be Bigger, More Customer-Friendly</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> will be bigger and its employees more personable in five years if its new owners accomplish their goals. `` Personal relations of our people with the passengers is what's going to be the biggest difference,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, who led a $ 3.65 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company in June and replaced <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> as chairman last week `` If you can move a few -LRB- market -RRB- share points to your aircraft you really drive the economics of this business,'' he said. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said Monday that the timing of <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON>'s resignation was a mild surprise. But they said his departure was not altogether unexpected given that the 43-year-old <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> is a relatively young executive who was not accustomed to reporting to a group of private investors. `` He made it clear from the very first day he would be assessing the situation,'' <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said. `` A man like <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> undoubtedly has a lot of options.'' <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON>'s three top officers also resigned last week, but <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said they do not expect other executives to leave <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, one of the investors in the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> buyout, said he has met individually with about 30 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> executives and discussed possible pay raises `` We believe we have the enthusiastic participation from everyone who is left,'' <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said. Neither <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> has airline experience and the two former <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officers said they are relying heavily on the experience of senior employees. In a wide-ranging, 90-minute news conference Monday, the two men said: _ Management will consider selling stock to employees and possibly making <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> a public company again through a public stock sale if the money is needed for expansion or other reasons _ Northwest is within weeks of announcing a purchase of new airplanes <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> did not identify the companies they are negotiating with or how much money they intend to spend. _ The airline intends to expand its <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> routes and its domestic flight schedule, a move that could require additional financing _ The airline is evaluating 15 to 20 proposals to develop its land in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which some analysts have said could fetch up to $ 500 million if sold <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said the proposed deals would `` improve the property'' and `` liberate'' cash. He said one of the proposals will be chosen during the first three months of next year. _ <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, hired last week as executive vice president, is exploring the possibility of starting an airplane leasing subsidiary for Northwest <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said their chief concern is to make Northwest the airline of choice for business and leisure travelers. Northwest does not now enjoy that status, they said. After Northwest acquired <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 for $ 884 million, performance at the nation's fourth-largest carrier suffered. Late arrival and baggage complaints were common as management was slow in bringing former Republic workers up to par in pay with their Northwest counterparts. `` We are in the fortuante position that the hard work from that acquisition is virtually complete,'' <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said he will spend most of the next year meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> employees around the globe to boost morale and tap the workers for ideas. He said he wants to give autonomy to managers at `` the lowest levels of the hierarchy'' as part of his philosophy of decentralized decision-making. The two stressed that they do not view themselves as interim managers. `` We are operating executives who have taken a long-term point of view,'' said <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, a finalist in December 1987 for the top job at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Said <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>: `` This has got to be the most exciting industry in the world. I mean, it is fun.'' <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said he has not decided how to replace $ 230 million in equity that belongs to <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> to reduce <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION>'s investment in the buyout by that much to reduce concerns about foreign ownership of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines

 <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has withstood economic damage from the June crackdown on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s democracy movement, though it is facing a serious problem in building confidence in the capitalist British territory that reverts to Chinese rule in seven years, its financial secretary says. `` I am not going to tell you that we have no problems in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and that everything is as right as rain,'' Sir Piers <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said Monday in a speech to the <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Society </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he was visiting business executives and bankers. But, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said: `` I have every reason to believe that <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> will come out of recent events fitter and more vigorous than before. Ours is a city of survivors well used to living on the edge.'' Thousands of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents have sought to leave the capitalist territory adjoining southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the violent military suppression of a student-led democracy drive three months ago in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. By some estimates, emigration will rise 25 percent next year to 55,000. The Chinese Communist government's handling of the crackdown suggested to many would-be <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> emigrants that it will violate an agreement to preserve <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s capitalist way of life for 50 years beyond the takeover in 1997. The rising number of people seeking sanctuary abroad has depressed <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> stocks and property values, caused a `` brain-drain'' in many industries and raised pressure on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to provide refuge for those who want to leave. Moreover, unease about <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s future has spread increasing doubts about the territory's role as one of the most dynamic and productive economic centers of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. As part of his argument to dispel these doubts, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> carried a list of 20 major international investments in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> since the crackdown in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. Among them are a $ 667 million <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> loan for a high-rise office complex in which the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank will retain a 10 percent stake; a $ 1.34 billion loan from a consortium of banks to finance expansion of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s container port; a commitment from <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> to base its <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>; and an agreement by <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to double its oil-terminal capacity there. `` What has been the effect on our economy of the recent events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and in particular Tiananmen Square? Surprisingly perhaps, the answer is not very great,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. He said although the emigration of talented professionals was regrettable, `` there can be absolutely no question of our impeding their departure in any way whatsoever. What we have to do is to provide the right sort of environment to persuade people to stay or even to encourage them to return.'' The finance official was in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for talks with international bankers and business executives. American companies historically have been the biggest foreign investors in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and their role there is deemed crucial for the territory to thrive.

<HEAD>IBM, Cray, Motorola Announce Job Reductions</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> have announced plans to eliminate the jobs of hundreds of workers each to cut costs. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it is offering special payments to people who quit or retire at four locations, a step that is expected to cut 600 to 1,000 jobs. The job cuts, which are voluntary, represent less than half of 1 percent of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> work force of 223,000. The four locations are <LOCATION> Owego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> makes specialized equipment for defense contracts; <LOCATION> Endicott </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, where it makes the 9370 line of minicomputers; and <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, where it makes typewriters and printers. Most of the people who will be offered the special payments are in administrative and support areas, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. They will be given a bonus of one week's pay for each six months they have worked for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, up to a maximum of one year's pay. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thonis </PERSON> said the cost of the cuts would not significantly hurt the company's profits. He said the cuts were not related to a slowdown in sales of products made at the four locations. <LOCATION> Schaumburg </LOCATION>, Ill.-based <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday a plan to reduce its 105,000-employee work force by about 2,500 positions, primarily salaried jobs at its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants. `` We've improved our normal voluntary severance package,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Sengstock </PERSON>. `` Those applying who are accepted will now receive two weeks' severance pay for each year of service.'' <PERSON> Sengstock </PERSON> said most of those being urged to take the severance package work in the electronics company's communications and semiconductor products groups. If not enough workers take the severance package, there may be layoffs, said <PERSON> Sengstock </PERSON>. The company said a pretax provision of about $ 43 million to cover the cost of the severance program would be reflected in third-quarter earnings to be announced next week. <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said the program `` simply reflects what we at <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> consider to be good and prudent management and provides a means for us to reduce our cost base.'' He said the company was not predicting an earnings downturn. The package will be offered to workers at selected <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> facilities until about mid-November, <PERSON> Sengstock </PERSON> said. He mentioned plants in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Boynton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, as among the facilities where salaried employees would be encouraged to take severance. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's largest supercomputer manufacturers, announced Monday it is laying off 400 employees at two <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> plants. The layoffs are due to a failure to meet sales projections and the fact that fewer employees are needed to manufacture today's supercomputer systems, the Minneapolis-based company said <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> said it has essentially completed the transition from the Cray X-MP system to the more advanced <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> Y-MP product line. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> has about 5,400 employees worldwide. The company said all costs associated with the manufacturing work force reduction would be incurred in 1989, and are expected to total about $ 3 million. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> said it was eliminating 280 jobs at <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and 120 at its <LOCATION> Rice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> plant. The company offered full salary to the end of year for any employees who left voluntarily at the end of the month. Any layoffs will be based on seniority, <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> said. Workers who lose their jobs would also get $ 4,000 in education grants, the company said.

 The management of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will remain <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> even after the company is acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3.4 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Akio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> will leave filmmaking decisions to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> managers just as it has left day-to-day management of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, which it acquired in 1987, to local executives. Industry analysts say <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> has taken a hands-off approach to running <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest music company. `` <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> will remain in the hands of American management,'' <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> told a news conference. `` We manage our subsidiaries as autonomous businesses and though we provide financial backing we give complete autonomy and make a business environment where local people can do creative work.'' On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors gave formal approval to the sale of the company's 53.8 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>, at $ 27 a share. With that completed, <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer for the shares would begin Wednesday. <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> has `` no immediate plans'' to send Japanese executives to work at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, and said his company would work to allay fears of a `` Japanese invasion.'' Some Americans have expressed concern that <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> may use its ownership for `` propaganda'' purposes or may censor films critical of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Congresswoman <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Delich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> has called for an investigation into whether <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> will reduce competition, thereby violating anti-trust laws, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. Critics in both <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have raised fears that the takeover may increase friction at a time when a $ 50 billion bilateral trade imbalance and rapidly increasing Japanese investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are raising economic tensions. `` I think it's too bad such concerns have been raised,'' <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> said. He stressed that the takeover was a friendly one welcomed by <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> and said he expected the relationship would follow the pattern of <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s buyout of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> I spoke with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> executives and they said ` Thank you very much for buying us' and I was very happy when I heard that,'' <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> said. `` We worked hard to make a good working environment and they're completely satisfied.'' <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> said he hoped that rather than increasing friction, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s management of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> entertainment firms would set a good example. `` If we ... show the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> is a success for its American employees, we can remove apprehensions and concerns and Americans may no longer feel Japanese are strangers or ca n't be understood,'' <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> said. He said recent takeovers by non-Japanese firms have not raised as many fears among Americans. Australian-born media tycoon <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> bought 20th-Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, and the Australian firm <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> recently purchased <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> with less press attention than the <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> buyout.

 <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> could get $ 1.5 billion for the natural gas and oil reserves it has offered for sale through its <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, Wall Street analysts said. A sale would leave <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> with its biggest business _ gas gathering _ still intact, but would eliminate a business that one analyst said was draining the subsidiary. `` I estimate that TXO's producing properties are losing $ 30 million to $ 40 million per year on an operating basis,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. The Pittsburgh-based steel and energy giant said it would use the proceeds from the sale to reduce its $ 5.8 billion debt and to buy back stock in an effort to boost shareholder value and enhance its balance sheet. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> has been a disappointment to <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> since it was acquired in 1986 in a $ 3 billion stock swap. `` I think shareholders have just lost their patience,'' <PERSON> Fleischer </PERSON> said Monday after the sale was announced. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> is showing a willingness to part with assets that probably will appreciate if held long enough but could enhance the stock's value now, he said `` This is a very strong statement that they're committed to shareholders,'' <PERSON> Fleischer </PERSON> said. Chief among the shareholders who stand to benefit is corporate raider <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who holds an 11 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fleischer </PERSON> and analyst <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracken </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> valued the reserves at around $ 1.5 billion. A sale is anticipated by year's end, said <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keslar </PERSON>, who declined to say how <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> values the reserves. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> said it has retained the investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to handle the sale. The reserves are principally located in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. After racking up impressive operating income of $ 547 million in 1984 and $ 377 million in 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gas reported an operating loss of $ 21 million the year <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> acquired it. It then broke about even with $ 2 million the next year and lost $ 31 million last year. The sale, besides boosting <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings, will help with <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>'s goal of reducing debt and may lead to the repurchase of stock or raise the dividend, he said. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> had been pinning its hopes for a turnaround at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> on the prospect of a surge in natural gas prices. `` I'm bullish on gas prices,'' <PERSON> Bracken </PERSON> said. `` I'd expect over the next two to three years gas would reach ` btu' parity with oil.''

<HEAD>European Foreign Ministers Adopt TV Proposal Opposed By U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 European foreign ministers Tuesday adopted a measure intended to prompt local television stations to use mostly home-grown programs. The officials, representing the 12 nations of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, approved the proposal during the start of day-long talks on a range of foreign policy and trade issues. Only <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> opposed the TV plan, according to a community spokesman, who demanded anonymity. The proposal, called Television Without Frontiers, has sparked sharp complaints from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and film industry. It sets out the trading bloc's blueprint for opening up TV broadcasting as part of the move to a single, European-wide market of 320 million consumers in late 1992. By that date, the dozen nations of the Common Market intend to remove the many trade barriers restricting the free movement of money, goods, services and people. The TV measure would enable broadcasters in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to transmit channels throughout the trading bloc as long as they did not violate certain moral and other standards. But it also contained a provision designed to ensure that _ `` where practicable'' _ a majority of entertainment programs shown on European television be made in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In approving the measure, the foreign ministers agreed on wording that, according to the spokesman, says, `` This is an obligation which is politically binding on member states to achieve.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has urged the community to scrap the plan. The American TV industry said its European earnings would be seriously hurt by such a restriction. During a European swing last month, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> reiterated the American opposition. `` We are not in favor of local content in any context and more particularly in the province of thoughts,'' she said. Local content provisions refer to measures requiring that a certain percentage of a product be produced domestically. There has been concern in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about several community proposals that would appear to throw up protectionist barriers around the European-wide market in 1992. Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> had earlier written key members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the community's legislative body, to complain about the TV measure. Community quotas, she wrote, `` would be blatantly discriminatory, patently unjustifiable, and would almost certainly have a disastrous effect on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry's substantial European earnings.'' Defenders of quotas argued that European culture was at stake. They fear a flood of American soap operas, sitcoms and other programs would tie up the airwaves. News, sports and game shows would be excluded.

 A former soybean trader at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> became the 13th person to plead guilty in connection with a federal investigation into illegal commodity trading activity. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggum </PERSON>, 47, pleaded guilty Monday to two counts of mail fraud before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eggum </PERSON> admitted to making a pre-arranged trade with an undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotert </PERSON>. `` Eggum misled the customer'' by noting a false time for placing his order and made about $ 125 on May 19, 1988 on a `` curb'' trade, after official trading had ended, <PERSON> Rotert </PERSON> said. Also, on Jan. 5, 1989, <PERSON> Eggum </PERSON> admitted to making $ 50 for a fellow trader to make up for a mistake Eggum had made, <PERSON> Rotert </PERSON> said. `` He deliberately sold at a price below what the lot was trading,'' he said. `` He used the customer order to repay another trader.'' The charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine, but prosecutors have said they will seek lighter sentences for those who agreed to cooperate. The trader to whom <PERSON> Eggum </PERSON> paid the $ 50 was <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Patten </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who already has entered a guilty plea for two counts of violation of the Commodities Exchange Act. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spent 2 -LCB- years investigating fraudulent trading at the <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. In all, 46 traders and a clerk were indicted. Thirteen people have pleaded guilty, and three have not yet entered pleas. The rest have pleaded innocent.

 <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> 73, weary of wisecracks about former union president <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>, has passed a resolution condemning politicians who make jokes about his disappearance. The resolution was adopted unanimously Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s legislative conference in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The council represents most union locals in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, with a total of about 100,000 members. In an interview in the November issue of <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, a self-professed hitman claims <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>'s body was buried near the west end zone of Giants Stadium in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rutherford </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, seeking to boost fellow Republican <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>'s bid to replace him, invoked <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>'s name in taking a jab at the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>. `` Trying to find out where <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> stands is like trying to find out where <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> is buried _ and it's not under Giants Stadium,'' <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said last week in addressing a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fundraiser that was attended by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON>, business manager of Teamsters Local 945 in <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, introduced the measure. `` If you do n't have any respect for the man, then think at least deadline at hand, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> are exerting heavy pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to go along with a proposal for preliminary peace talks with Palestinian representatives. Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> sounded upbeat Monday about prospects for a peace settlement, saying a `` golden opportunity'' exists that must not be squandered. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who has been campaigning hard for a more flexible <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> position on the issue, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should not feel threatened by the 10-point proposal for peace talks set forth by <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. The inner cabinet of ministers from <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor is to meet Thursday on <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s ideas amid deep divisions on how to proceed. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> rejects <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s acceptance of a U.S.-backed formula that involves trading occupied land for peace and including people deported by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> negotiating delegation. Labor, led by Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, supports both ideas. Meanwhile, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Monday and told him `` a dialogue was necessary'' between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> disclosed today. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke with the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader for `` just a few minutes'' in advance of Monday's <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meeting with Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. `` The discussion was very general,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> contacted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> mainly as a courtesy. `` He emphasized our interest in the peace process ... that he obviously felt a dialogue was necessary,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> told reporters the essential next step in the peace process is to persuade the Israelis and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to enter a dialogue `` without preconditions.'' `` We wo n't get to peace until Palestinians and Israelis speak to each other,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> regards the <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> plan as a complement to _ not a substitute for _ <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal for elections in which Palestinians would select representatives to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on limited self-government in the occupied territories. Monday's White House session came amid new concern that settling Jewish immigrants from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> could threaten peace efforts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials reacted coolly to an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> request for $ 400 million in housing loan guarantees for about 100,000 Jewish emigres from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have said some dwellings probably will be in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> policy is to oppose additional settlements in the occupied territories,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ability to assist <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is limited by `` severe budgetary constraints.''

 Windshields were smashed and tires flattened today on a picket line set up in support of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. More than 350 miners in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> walked out Monday at mines filling <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> orders. At the <ORGANIZATION> Rob </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said `` jackrocks,'' or bent roofing nails welded together, were used to flatten the tires of at least three coal trucks, a management employee's pickup and a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> cruiser. Two passing coal trucks had windshields smashed. Nearly 200 men in camouflage congregated around the entrance to <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Fork </PERSON>, where the strike affects 50 miners. As the crowd parted to allow foremen to drive through, a faint ringing could be heard as jackrocks dropped on the pavement. State Police said no immediate arrests were made. A striking miner was hit by a non-union coal truck attempting to cross a picket line Monday, but he was not seriously hurt. The incident set off a four-hour confrontation between miners and a convoy of non-union trucks poised to cross the line to unload their coal. The standoff ended with the trucks driving away. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> dispatched 38 troopers, but there were no arrests and no reported problems at other picket lines in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> ordered selective strikes at two mines in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and five in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to block shipments of coal the union contended were bound for the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> for processing. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's largest coal exporter.

<HEAD>Court Ruling Upends Biggest EEOC Age Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Payments of $ 35 million, the largest age discrimination settlement ever reached by the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, may be out of reach for 4,000 <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> retirees due to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, a legal specialist said. The court on Monday overturned a lower ruling that the Pittsburgh-based electronics and electric power giant had discriminated against the retirees when it offered them a choice between severence pay or early pensions. The employees could not have both under the company program. Backed by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 3rd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruling favoring the retirees, the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> negotiated a settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> a year ago. The 4,000 employees would have shared $ 35 million, or an average of $ 8,700 per person, to settle their claims. <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> case was the commission's largest age discrimination settlement. The <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION>, however, decided instead to seek a court ruling, she said. `` It means they blew it. They got greedy, in my opinion,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauver </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> pension lawyer who was not involved in the case. `` They chose to forgo a very favorable settlement to get a favorable court decision. `` The case is far from over,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, special assistant to the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> general counsel in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` There are still a number of areas for the court to decide.'' `` If the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> was a law firm, they could probably be sued for negligence,'' <PERSON> Lauver </PERSON> said. `` Those <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> employees are probably very upset.'' <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> said it was delighted with Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. The company will ask the <ORGANIZATION> 3rd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider its case in light of the new ruling and a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in June that puts more of a burden on the employee to prove discrimination.

 Prices advanced broadly on Wall Street today as the outlook for interest rates brightened. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials surged 22.79 to 2,736.51 as of noon EDT. Gainers outnumbered losers by a margin of about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 838 stocks up, 482 down and 509 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 88.06 million shares at midday. The market gathered some forward momentum late Monday in a late round of buying that lifted the Dow Jones industrial average above 2,700 to a four-week high. Analysts said stocks got a further boost this morning when interest rates fell in the credit markets and investors became optimistic that the trend might continue. Prices of long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds rose about $ 3 for each $ 1,000 in face value, lowering their yields to about 8.18 percent. Analysts said hopes seemed to be increasing that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might soon find room to relax its credit policy further, given a relatively slow pace of economic growth and no recent sign of increasing inflationary pressures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making body, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was meeting today, but it was unlikely that the central bank would immediately announce any decisions. The most actively-traded issue on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> was <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>, which was unchanged at 34 ~ On Monday, the company announced it was selling oil and natural gas reserves through its <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, and analysts have estimated <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> could get $ 1.5 billion in the sale.

 <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said today it was acquiring a half-interest in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> cellular franchise and selling interests in three Southern states to <ORGANIZATION> Contel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The first agreement could lead to <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> gaining sole control over one of the two cellular-telephone franchises in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the nation's biggest market. The second, covering 13 mobile-telephone franchises in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, would make the <ORGANIZATION> Contel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary the nation's seventh-largest cellular phone company, according to a statement issued by <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>, the largest. The statement said <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> signed an agreement to acquire the <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> interest in one of two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cellular franchises for $ 1.9 billion in cash, about $ 275 per `` pop,'' subject to a 45-day right of first refusal by <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. A pop is an industry yardstick obtained by multiplying a market area population by the percentage ownership of a cellular company serving the market Two cellular franchises, one for the local telephone company and one for an independent operation like <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>, are available in each market. The <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> deal would give <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> a 50 percent voting interest and 45.67 percent equity interest in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> franchise. LIN holds a 50 percent voting interest and 45 percent equity interest in the franchise, which would be controlled entirely by <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> if the LIN acquisition goes through. <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>'s separate $ 110-a-share cash tender offer for the approximately 53 million shares in LIN, a deal amounting to $ 250 to $ 265 a pop, has been extended to Oct. 13. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>, LIN's largest shareholder with a 10 percent interest, has been tendered more than 8 million shares, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Campo </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Adams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON>, representing McCaw in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Contel </ORGANIZATION> agreement would provide <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> about $ 1.3 billion in cash, about $ 205 a pop, subject to closing price adjustments. The <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> deal covers about 6.8 million pops and the <ORGANIZATION> Contel </ORGANIZATION> deal about 6.1 million pops. These are `` two more steps toward achieving our longstanding strategic objective of creating a national cellular network that will give <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consumers an independent alternative to traditional providers of telephone service,'' <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Brazil See Little Chance of Early Moves to Support World Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's biggest coffee producer, dashed hopes Wednesday of any early agreement to bring the depressed world coffee market back under international control. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s chief coffee executive <PERSON> Jorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Dauster </PERSON> said there was `` no chance of having quotas again in the near future'' because members of the international coffee group ca n't come to terms on export limits that ultimately set prices. <PERSON> Dauster </PERSON> heads the <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> delegation attending talks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't see any real change in the positions that led us into the deadlock,'' <PERSON> Dauster </PERSON> told reporters at a news conference. `` We should not rush into new negotiations unless we see that the elements that led us to deadlock have been removed.'' The organization Monday announced a two-year extension of the International Coffee Agreement retroactive to Sunday but without any price-support provisions. The agreement keeps in existence the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> as a forum for discussing matters of mutual concern to 41 coffee exporting countries and 18 importing countries. The organization was propping up prices in the glutted world market through export quotas aimed at supporting prices of beans at $ 1.20 per pound or more. The organization's regulatory powers were suspended indefinitely on July 4 after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pulled out in a price dispute with coffee-producing nations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted an increase in export quotas for higher-quality coffees enjoyed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers. Since July, the price of coffee beans has dropped by more than 30 percent to a 14-year low, threatening a huge loss in income for producing countries such as <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and most central American nations, where coffee is one of the top foreign income earners. The suspension of quotas followed a fight among producers over export market shares. In the previous negotiations, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> resisted moves to cut its 30 percent share of the export quota to bump up the allocation of Central American producers of the popular mild arabica variety. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the world's second biggest producer, has led the campaign to bring back quotas, seeing increased export earnings as critical to help it finance the fight against the country's drug cartel.

 <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced plans today to convert a <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> golf course into a movie theme park and a 5,000-room hotel-casino in efforts to entice both family fun-seekers and high rollers. `` The theme as far as movies is concerned has always been an interesting mouse trap,'' said <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Benninger </PERSON> at a news conference here. The <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian-owned </PERSON> company has agreed to purchase 115 acres on the strip, the current site of the Marina Hotel and Casino and <ORGANIZATION> Tropicana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and Golf Course, for the as-yet named theme park, said <PERSON> Benninger </PERSON>. The purchase of the land means <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> will construct a theme park twice the size originally planned for property on the MGM-owned Desert Inn. The purchase price was not revealed, but <PERSON> Benninger </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> Grand plans to spend as much as $ 700 million to add 4,300 rooms to the 700-room <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> and to build the theme park with a working film and television studio. The MGM Grand complex, to open in 1992, is the latest effort to woo families to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. Circus Circus, the first resort to do so more than a decade ago, is now one of the most successful gaming and entertainment operations in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. `` Clearly the theme park idea is one that has been looked at for quite a while and I believe it's another extension of what <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> stands for,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, the veteran entertainment analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's an adult resort, and now they're going to extend it so the rest of the family members can enjoy it too,'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said Thursday. MGM Grand, a separate company from <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, owns an all-frills <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> airline and the Desert Inn in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. It also retains rights to a stylized version of the famous MGM lion. The <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> billionaire, 72, had sold and bought back bits and pieces of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> for two decades, a period during which he also traded <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> hotels the way most people buy cars. Then last month, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> agreed to purchase <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> _ including the original lion logo _ for $ 1.5 billion, outbidding media mogul <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> by $ 100 million. Las Vegas city and tourism officials have said for years that the city needed a major theme park to help attract families as visitors. A water theme park, built on the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> five years ago, has been extremely successful. Las Vegas will count more than 18 million visitors this year, up from 11 million in 1980. The city is approaching the size that could support such a venture, boosters of the idea say. <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> had 300,000 residents eight years ago. Today it has more than 700,000 and is one of the fastest growing cities in the country. A fire at the original MGM Grand Hotel in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> built in 1973, killed 84 people in 1980. In 1985, <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> sold that <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> and its sister hotel in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for nearly $ 500 million.

 New home sales fell a slight 0.4 percent in August but remained over 750,000 for the second straight month, the government reported Tuesday, as buyers took advantage of lower interest rates. Analysts had forecast a steeper slide in August sales from a double-digit gain in July, the largest advance in three years. They said the pace can not be sustained but will remain healthy for the rest of the year. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that new single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted rate of 755,000 in August, a relatively small drop from July's revised 758,000 rate, which was a 16.1 percent increase over June. The Commerce report indicated new home sales were stronger throughout the summer than previously thought. Not only was the July figure revised upward; so too were the May and June figures, both of which totaled 653,000 units. `` It appears that the new home market is steaming along,'' said economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. `` What is noteworthy about the August numbers is not that they have gone down, but that sales remained at an extremely high level.'' The sales improvement was attributed by analysts to fixed-rate mortgages that dropped from an 11.22 percent peak in March to 9.81 percent at the end of August. The lower rates also improved sales of existing homes which, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>, rose 3.3 percent in August to 3.44 million units. However, mortgage rates had climbed back up to 10.16 percent by last Friday, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and analysts said the increase will affect future sales. `` It will be difficult to maintain this -LRB- new home sales -RRB- rate particularly since mortgage rates have increased,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Carliner </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, agreed the current pace is not sustainable, but said a sales range of between 680,000 to 700,000 `` still would be a very healthy pace for the new home market.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Obrinsky </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, also said the summer sales, which lowered inventories from an eight-month backlog in July to a six-month supply currently, should result in increased single-family housing starts this fall. Despite the recent boom, sales for the first eight months were held back 2.7 percent from the same period in 1988 by the higher interest rates earlier in the year as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> tightened credit to slow inflation. Sales of new homes in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, which had jumped 50 percent to 108,000 units in July, slipped 0.9 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 107,000 units. Sales in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> were down 27.9 percent to 93,000 units after rising 26.7 percent to 129,00 units a month earlier. Sales in the South rose 6.2 percent to 310,000 and were up 6.6 percent in the West to 244,000 units. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said the median price of a new home was $ 122,900 in August, up 6.0 percent from $ 116,000 in July. The median is the point where half of the homes sold for more and half for less. The average price of a new home rose 14.6 percent to $ 162,300.

 Shares prices closed sharply higher Tuesday as enthusiasm over Wall Street's continued advance overcame concern over prospects for a British interest rate hike.

Volume came to 553.8 million shares, higher than Monday's 403.8 million shares. Dealers said that even though fears of a British interest rate hike still were prevalent, the market was underpinned by the pound's strength after repeated British central bank support.

 <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says it has agreed to buy FM radio stations in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and will seek a waiver to operate the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> station in a market where the company operates a television station. Great American did not disclose what it will pay <ORGANIZATION> Sandusky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> for the two stations, <ORGANIZATION> KBPI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WKRL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. The purchase brings to 12 the number of FM stations <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> owns. `` We are looking forward to entering the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> radio market.

In applying for a waiver earlier this year for <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Great American cited numerous operating efficiencies gained from having both TV and radio stations in a market. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> granted waivers in both cases, although <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> rank just below the top 25 markets.

 Prices moved higher on Wall Street today as blue chip issues extended their rally and the outlook for interest rates brightened. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials surged 21.65 to 2,735.37 as of 2 p.m. EDT after climbing nearly 21 points on Monday. The broader market also advanced, but lagged a little behind the blue chips. Gainers outnumbered losers by a margin of about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 895 stocks up, 516 down and 507 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 129.93 million shares with two hours of trading left. The market gathered some forward momentum late Monday in a late round of buying that lifted the Dow Jones industrial average above 2,700 to a four-week high and that continued into today.

<HEAD>Hello `Smart Toilets,' Car Radar; Good-Bye Bad Service, Loud Rock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE WHEELAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` Smart toilets'' and car radar will usher in the high-tech advances coming in the 1990s, while bad service, loud rock music and Mexican beer will become passe, says `` The American Forecaster 1990.'' Other trends on the rise for 1990 are New Age radio, portraits commissioned for ego gratification and `` wet'' beer to serve on the rocks, says <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, author of the yearly book. White will be the fashionable color in clothing for women, who will favor shorter hair, he says. Men will grow their hair longer and wear wider ties, the Forecaster predicts. `` In the 1990s we will see phenomenal advances. A popular phrase some futurists are using is that life has the potential to move forward very rapidly because 80 percent of all the scientists and engineers who have ever lived are alive today,'' said Long. `` The corollary to that is that 80 percent of all the artists, crackpots and loonies who have ever lived are alive today. We will see some intriguing things happen in the 1990s,'' he said, including a wave of bizarre prognostications as the year 2000 approaches. Long, 40, is a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> free-lance author who began writing the Forecaster in 1983 and claims an 80 percent accuracy rate. He wrongly predicted a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> presidency and the demise of television's `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and `` Dynasty,'' but he estimated half his material reflects inevitable consumer trends. For example, a few years ago, he forecast that Cabbage Patch doll sales would drop by half. `` They dropped off by more than half. It was n't guesswork. The information came from the toy industry, which says that all fad toys that sell that well that quickly are temporary phenomena.'' His predictions sometimes are based on his research into Japanese product development. `` Smart toilets'' are made by a Japanese company to measure recent hospital outpatients' blood pressure, pulse, urine, temperature and body weight. Results are displayed on a built-in monitor. Long predicts gadget lovers will pay the $ 3,000 to have a conversation piece. Other high-tech trends in 1990 will be robot hamburger-makers employed by fast-food franchises to solve chronic labor problems, and car radar. Long said car radar systems will gauge other vehicles' speeds and may incorporate automatic braking. Some experts believe if all vehicles had the devices, highways could be safely packed with vehicles moving at high speeds. New Age radio took off so quickly that it is a major trend, said Long. `` It's going to be a permanent form of programming,'' he said. `` It's been called musical wallpaper, at its most disparaging. It's somewhere between jazz and soft rock, and it has the potential to not offend a fairly wide proportion of the population. Meanwhile, affluent executives are commissioning sculptures and portraits of themselves and their families, a trend Long calls `` ego-art.'' `` They are recycling what once was a very solid artistic tradition.'' A low-budget version, the video booth, is cropping up in shopping centers and shouldering aside the booths where people used to have wallet-size snapshots taken. `` They shoot a five - or 10-minute videotape,'' said Long `` You can speak, sing, or quote poetry. It's the concept of immortalizing yourself.'' A major trend that will carry through the 1990s is a campaign by retailers to stamp out bad service. `` Surveys, polls and extensive studies have shown that this is the top priority,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. `` We have become line-sensitive. Queueing up is a foreign disease that we do n't want to catch.'' Ear plugs are being offered to customers at pop music clubs and rock concerts because of concern about hearing loss, according to `` The American Forecaster.'' He notes that at the same time, over-amped car sound systems are booming. Among drinkers, the Mexican beer fad will be on the way out, he predicted. Liquor with lower alcohol levels and `` wet'' beer, a brew served on the rocks, will debut in 1990 while low-alcohol beer will continue to founder, said Long. Long's book, which sells fewer than 10,000 copies despite all the interest it stirs up, may be in for some high-tech changes itself. In the works is a possible video version with computer animation, and Long is exploring use of a computer database and facsimile machine to dispense his prognostications.

 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers cast ballots today to decide whether to accept a three-year contract offer from the prospering aerospace company or reaffirm a midnight strike deadline for about 50,000 employees. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union said talks that began Sept. 21 and were joined by a federal mediator during the weekend ended early Monday. `` They said, ` This is our final and best offer. This is it. It's over,''' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Neither <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> referred to the offer as an agreement or tentative settlement. Neither side would disclose any details, and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would n't say whether union leaders recommend acceptance or rejection. The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> today quoted unnamed sources as saying the proposed pact provides pay boosts of 4 percent in the first year and 3 percent in the second and third years, as well as production bonuses of 8 percent and 4 percent, respectively, in the first two years. The last contract included annual bonuses but no increase in base wages, which determine other benefits. The pact also contains some reduction in mandatory overtime, which is limited to 200 hours per quarter under the current contract, the newspaper reported. `` We've made progress in some areas, but we're not jumping up and down,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Monday. Groups of workers picketed on Monday outside an administration building in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION> and at the <LOCATION> Westin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, where the latest talks took place. `` The tension here is so thick that you can feel it,'' said a worker on the 767 production line in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>. The worker, who asked that his name not be used, said some workers marched through the plant chanting `` strike, strike, strike'' during their lunch hour Monday. Simultaneous votes were scheduled today for the 43,300 Seattle-area members of the union lodge, as well as 12,000 Machinists in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, 1,700 in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and several hundred at smaller <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> job sites around the country, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. A simple majority is sufficient for acceptance or rejection of the contract, but two-thirds is required for a strike. The union last struck <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in 1977. That walkout lasted two months. The current contract expires at midnight tonight, the same time as the union's strike deadline. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest commercial airplane builder, is enjoying its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner orders, with carriers and leasing companies ordering 736 planes worth $ 38.5 billion so far this year. Though Pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> has a backlog of nearly 1,600 jets worth about $ 70 billion and deliveries extending well into the mid-1990s. During the first part of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had net earnings of $ 356 million on sales of $ 9.07 billion. For 1988, profits were $ 614 million on $ 16.96 billion in sales. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> also holds $ 3.66 billion in cash and short-term notes. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is better off than it has ever been in history, and we should be better off than we've ever been,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told a rally last month. Worldwide, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employs 144,725 people, including 106,000 in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 Prices advanced on Wall Street today as investors grew more optimistic about the outlook for interest rates and scooped up blue chip issues. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials surged 24.31 to 2,738.03 as of 3 p.m. EDT after climbing nearly 21 points on Monday. The broader market also gained, although it lagged somewhat behind the blue chips. Advancers outnumbered losers by a margin of about 11 to 7 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 875 stocks up, 569 down and 506 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 147.45 million shares with one hour of trading left. The market gathered some forward momentum late Monday in a late round of buying that lifted the Dow Jones industrial average above 2,700 to a four-week high and that continued into today. Analysts said a stronger dollar and gains on the bond markets helped spark today's Wall Street advance. Bond prices moved higher on optimism that interest rates might come down.

 Wheat futures prices advanced while other grain and soybean futures closed narrowly mixed Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. The modest advance in the wheat market was linked in part to expectations that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> eventually will accept an Egyptian bid for 500,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> rejected an Egyptian bid Tuesday morning, but analysts said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> had come back with a higher bid. Corn and soybean futures opened lower and stayed on the defensive for most of the session. The selling reflected harvest pressure and profit-taking after a strong rally in the previous session. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> six - to 10-day outlook issued late Monday called for little or no rain for the <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> corn and soybean country during the first four day of next week Corn and soybean harvesting advanced at a strong pace last week under ideal weather conditions, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that showed 16 percent of the corn crop and 18 percent of the soybean crop harvested as of Sunday compared to 10 percent and 4 percent, respectively, a week earlier. At the close, wheat futures were 1 \ cents to 3 cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.09 -RCB- a bushel; corn futures were -LCB- cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with December at $ 2.41 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with December at $ 1.47 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 -LCB- cents lower to 2 cents higher with November at $ 5.77 a bushel

 <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is making the right move by giving up its global leadership in the laptop computer market but its success in the cutthroat television business is far from assured, industry experts say. The outlook for higher TV prices bodes well in the near term for <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, which is the last major TV manufacturer based in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the second-biggest seller of color TVs. But <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s survival in consumer electronics over the long haul depends on its ability to develop innovative products while keeping its costs low and its public profile high. `` It's going to be a grunt and grind to do this thing,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an analyst with the Houston-based brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION> Rotan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. `` But now they've got the cash to do it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> announced on Monday it had agreed to sell its computer division, which includes <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> and the build-it-yourself <ORGANIZATION> Heath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> for as much as $ 635 million. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> will use the proceeds to eliminate most of its burdensome debt load. The Glenview-based company will have an after-tax gain of $ 22 million, Chairman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 1.4 billion worth of computers last year and is the world's larget seller of battery-powered laptop computers, with 27.6 percent of the world market, according to <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION>, a high-technology marketing research firm. But in the past year, other major computer makers have introduced laptop models that compete with <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s for both consumer and defense-contract business. Faced with tough competition in both computers and televisions and unable to finance both, analysts say, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> was forced to choose between borrowing more money or selling part of the company. Unable to find a buyer willing to pay more than about $ 200 million for its consumer-electronics unit, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> opted out of the more salable computer business instead. `` I thought it was something they should do but I was n't sure they would they would do it,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassenberg </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION>, one of many analysts who applauded the decision. According to <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION>, a publication that tracks the TV industry, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> ranked second to French-owned RCA in sales of 1989 model color TVs to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealers. But its share of the market has slipped to 12 percent from 18.5 percent over the past seven years while such competitors as <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> have steadily gained market share. <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s consumer electronics business was profitable in 1988 excluding interest costs and is expected to be $ 15 million more profitable than that in 1989, again excluding interest costs. He also emphasized <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to high-definition television, using sharper-picture technology that some see as the future of TV. But analysts said HDTV is still several years away. And prospects for higher TV prices after nearly a decade of decline are tied to a continued shortage of glass for picture tubes and continued strong demand from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Zenith that emerges after the computer-division sale will have lots of cash and not much debt, which could make it an attractive takeover target, some analysts believe. But other say foreign television makers, the most likely suitors, would be reluctant to bid for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s last TV maker. That was what made it difficult to sell the television business in the first place. `` It's easier for a foreign company to buy the computer business because there are a lot of other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer businesses,'' said analyst <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

 Prices surged higher on Wall Street today as investors grew more optimistic about the outlook for interest rates and snapped up blue chip and consumer stocks. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials reached a new closing high, gaining 40.84 to end the session at 2,754.56. That topped the widely-followed barometer's previous high close of 2,752.09, reached Sept. 1. The market extended its advance of Monday, when the industrial average gained nearly 21 points. Analysts said a stronger dollar and gains on the bond markets helped spark today's Wall Street performance. Bond prices moved higher on optimism that interest rates might come down. Analysts said hopes seemed to be increasing that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might soon find room to relax its credit policy further, given a relatively slow pace of economic growth and no recent sign of increasing inflationary pressures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making body, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was meeting today, but the central bank did not announce any decisions before the close of trading. The stocks of financial service and other consumer-oriented businesses were among the standouts in today's session, while some technology issues were among the losers. Analysts said traders were looking for issues with predictable growth.

 <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> unveiled a new razor Tuesday and said it would support it with a $ 175 million multinational sales and marketing campaign, which the company said would be the biggest ever in the shaving industry. But analysts said the company could nick itself in the pocketbook if consumers do n't take to the higher-priced product, which <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> is billing as the biggest shaving advance in 20 years. The silver and black razor, called Sensor, and featuring two spring - mounted, ultra-thin blades, will be sold starting in January at an introductory price of $ 3.75 `` We want to make sure people are not inhibited from using it because of a high price for trial,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, vice president of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>. The system's refill cartridges will cost 25 percent more than similar blades now on the market, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said, and double the cost of disposable razors. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said using the Sensor system would cost about $ 20 a year, compared with about $ 16 for <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s Atra Plus and about $ 10 for disposable razors. The new product will be promoted in 19 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> countries, with about $ 80 million of the $ 175 million to be spent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In trading Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s stock rose $ 1 to $ 47.87 -LCB- a share Its stock price has surged from about $ 33 a share last December, partly in anticipation of the new product. `` The big concern would be ` Can consumers tell the difference between the new system and the old?''' said <PERSON> Bonita </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, analyst with the investment concern <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroder </ORGANIZATION>. `` Also, it will be more expensive to the consumer, so will the margins be as good as other products?'' <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> officials said last week that the new razor was developed over the course of about 10 years at a cost of some $ 200 million. Sensor is similar to <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s Atra brand, which has a pivoting, twin-blade razor head. However, Sensor's design also enables each spring-cushioned blade to move independently, which <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> says allows it to hug the skin without digging in. The Atra Plus, with two cartridges, sells for about $ 4. Many analysts declined to comment on the new product before they had the opportunity to view it first-hand. But most agreed the production costs were high. `` They spent lot of money on it,'' said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>, analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` But historically when <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> has brought out a new blade it has been successful.'' `` Market share will be critical,'' <PERSON> Wertheim </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said. `` They will need to take enough market share to justify the expenses.'' <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> said it holds 18 patents on the product and four others are pending. <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> said the company will license the razors eventually to make a compatible blade `` but it wo n't be this coming year.'' Other razor companies were quick to point out the benefits of their own products and find fault with the new razor. `` You're still putting cold steel on your face which I understood was done away in a number of countries when they did away with the guillotine. It is not the modern away of shaving,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiam </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Remington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has aout 40 percent of the electric shaver market. <PERSON> Kiam </PERSON> added that the new product could benefit his company. `` What <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> is trying to do is trade people up from disposables to systems,'' he said. `` We're in the upper end of the market and therefore it should help the growth of that entire segment.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner-Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes Schick razors, cited the new razor's expected higher retail price. <PERSON> Schick </PERSON>'s Ultrex Plus and Slim Twin razors sell for under $ 3. `` With Sensor, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> is asking consumers to pay a significantly higher premium price ... `` said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> LeFebvre </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Warner-Lambert </ORGANIZATION>'s consumer health products unit. <PERSON> LeFebvre </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Schick </PERSON>'s total market share has risen while <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s has declined. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> is indeed ` The best a man can get,''' referring to <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s advertising slogan, `` their recent sales do n't support it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> said the new product was simultaneously launched in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the first such international marketing blitz for the company. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> has interests in toiletries and writing products, but its biggest stake is in razors, where it controls more than 60 percent of the world market. Analysts have said the new product would help expand market share and improve earnings for Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>, which fended off takeover attempts in recent years but had to weather major restructurings in the process. The company undertook a major restructuring after turning down a $ 4.12 billion <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> buyout offer in November 1986. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> repurchased 15.6 million of its shares to head off an attempted takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Sink With No Quotas In Sight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Coffee futures prices sank to new life-of-contract lows Tuesday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s chief coffee executive said he saw no chance for a return to international price supports until next year. On other commodity markets, livestock futures advanced; precious metals declined, energy futures rose; and grains and soybeans were mixed. Futures prices for green, unroasted coffee settled 3.51 cents to 4.03 cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at 76.50 cents. All contracts established new lifetime lows during the session but none fell below 74.80 cents, the 14-year low established Aug. 14 by the now-expired September contract. The heaviest selling occurred early in the session after <PERSON> Jorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Dauster </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said he saw no possibility of a new International Coffee Agreement before next March, when the new Brazilian president takes office. <PERSON> Dauster </PERSON> made the remarks to reporters covering an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The representatives of 41 coffee exporting countries and 18 importing countries will wrap up their two-week session on Friday. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's largest coffee producer, wields a heavy bat at the talks. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s reluctance to accept a lower coffee export quota was one of the factors that led to a breakdown of the coffee price support system three months ago. `` We should not rush into new negotiations unless we see that the elements that led us to deadlock have been removed,'' <PERSON> Dauster </PERSON> told reporters at a news conference. Few observers expect the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> meeting to produce a new price-support mechanism to succeed the export quotas that were suspended July 4, precipitating a 30 percent drop in coffee prices. But <PERSON> Dauster </PERSON>'s remarks reinforced perceptions that the coffee market is headed lower still. <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Eskenasy </PERSON>, a market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said coffee-producing countries continue to underprice each other in a battle for market share, eliminating an incentive for coffee roasters to buy in large quantity. `` They are just buying hand-to-mouth,'' she said. `` There are a lot of cheap coffees all over the place.'' Ms. <PERSON> Eskenasy </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> recently dropped the price for its old-crop coffee, which is of lower quality than newly harvested beans, to 60 cents a pound and several other producers were selling old-crop coffee at 65 cents a pound. Hog futures rose sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in response to higher-than-expected cash prices and strengthening chart signals. Cattle futures rebounded from Monday's steep losses. Live cattle settled .08 cent to .35 cent higher with October at 71.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .35 cent higher with October at 82.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent lower to .93 cent higher with October at 45.10 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .50 cent lower with February at 48.50 cents a pound. Gold and silver futures slipped lower on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the dollar strengthened on currency markets. Gold settled 70 cents to 80 cents lower with October at $ 366.90 a troy ounce; silver was 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent lower with December at $ 5.295 a troy ounce. Most energy futures advanced modestly on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly report, which showed a slight decline in refining activity, a 1.7-million-barrel increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil stocks, a 4.5-million-barrel rise in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gasoline stocks and a 112,000-barrel increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks of petroleum distillates. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 18 cents higher with November at $ 20.13 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent to .46 cent higher with November at 59.68 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .16 cent lower to .67 cent higher with November at 56.64 cents a gallon. Wheat futures advanced while other grain and soybean futures closed narrowly mixed Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat settled 1 \ cents to 3 \ cents higher with December at $ 4.09 -RCB- a bushel; corn futures were unchanged to 1 cent lower with December at $ 2.40 -LCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with December at $ 1.47 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 -RCB- cents lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with November at $ 5.76 \

<HEAD>MGM Grand to Build Movie Theme Park in Las Vegas</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it will spend $ 700 million to convert a <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> golf course into a movie theme park and a 5,000-room hotel-casino, gambling on luring families to `` the best mouse trap in town.'' `` I remember the days when <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> lived almost entirely on the high roller,'' <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Benninger </PERSON> said at a news conference at the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Hotel. `` You ca n't do that anymore.'' The site is on the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> location where the <ORGANIZATION> Tropicana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and Marina Hotel and Casino now stand. <PERSON> Benninger </PERSON> would n't reveal how much MGM Grand paid for those properties. Other details were sketchy as well, although conceptual drawings showed towering spires and domes, like a futuristic version of Sleeping Beauty's Castle at <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>. MGM Grand, owned by <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, said last month it might build the theme park on a 60-acre site beside the <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>, which it owns and is promoting as a top-end hotel-casino. The new theme park site, at 115 acres, is nearly twice as large. <PERSON> Benninger </PERSON> said finding enough space was a more important consideration than money. The new MGM Grand Hotel and theme park are tentatively expected to open by late 1992. <PERSON> Benninger </PERSON> said he was confident the complex, with hotel rooms costing about $ 40 a night, would cash in on the trend toward family tourism in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> that began with the opening of Circus Circus a decade ago. Las Vegas will count more than 18 million visitors this year, up from 11 million in 1980. Its population has boomed from 300,000 eight years ago to more than 700,000. <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> officials have said for years that the city needed a major theme park to help attract families. A water theme park, built on the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> five years ago, has been extremely successful. `` Clearly the theme park idea is one that has been looked at for quite a while,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, veteran entertainment analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's an adult resort, and now they're going to extend it so the rest of the family members can enjoy it too. <PERSON> Benninger </PERSON> said movie themes had proved an enduring lure to tourists, as proved by expansions of <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> movie theme parks `` There has always been competition in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Benninger </PERSON> said. `` I'm not worried about competition. We're building the best mouse trap in town.'' <PERSON> Benninger </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> will add 4,300 rooms to the 700-room <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> at a cost of about $ 250 million. The theme park, which will cost about $ 450 million, will include a working film and television studio, although he said it might have just one sound stage. It is anticipated that the complex will employ 7,000 workers. Other details were sketchy. A name for the complex, and even its designers, have yet to be selected. <PERSON> Benninger </PERSON> would n't reveal details about the attractions being considered, although he said there were many. He said `` two or three organizations'' had approached him about possible partnerships and left open the possibility of finding another partner. <PERSON> Benninger </PERSON> said MGM Grand regarded the development as a prototype and had already received calls from unidentified organizations about developing similar complexes elsewhere. MGM Grand, a separate company from <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owns an all-frills <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> airline as well as the Desert Inn. It also retains rights to a stylized version of the famous MGM lion. <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, 72, had sold and bought back bits and pieces of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> for two decades, a period during which he also traded <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> hotels the way most people buy cars. Then last month, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> agreed to purchase <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> _ including the original lion logo _ for $ 1.5 billion, outbidding media mogul <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> by $ 100 million. A fire at the original MGM Grand Hotel, which <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> built in 1973, killed 84 people in 1980. In 1985, <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> sold the hotel and its sister hotel in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for nearly $ 500 million.

 Wall Street surged to a new high Tuesday as investors, optimistic about the prospects for interest rates, scooped up blue chip and consumer issues. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials achieved a new closing high, rising 40.84 to end the session at 2,754.56. That topped the widely-followed barometer's previous high close of 2,752.09, reached on Sept. 1. Broader market indicators also scored new highs. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a margin of about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 996 stocks up, 509 down and 486 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to a heavy 182.55 million shares, up from 127.41 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 221.51 million shares. Analysts said Wall Street was awash with optimism about interest rates as prices rose and yields slumped in the credit markets. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond was up more than $ 5 in late afternoon trading, while its yield slumped to 8.16 percent from late Monday's 8.21 percent. Analysts said hopes seemed to be increasing that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might relax its credit policy further, given a relatively slow pace of economic growth and no recent sign of increasing inflationary pressures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, was meeting Tuesday, but the central bank followed its usual procedure and did not announce any decisions. Strength in the dollar, which withstood central bank intervention, also bolstered prices on Wall Street Tuesday. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Acampora </PERSON>, a market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said traders were upbeat to the point that they ignored some of the financial markets' recent worries, such as weakness in junk bonds. `` This market's turning a cold shoulder to what could be concerning news for investors,'' he said. Analysts reported some program trading, but the broad advance `` despite the negatives is telling us that there's a lot of interest out there,'' <PERSON> Acampora </PERSON> said. The market extended the gains it chalked up late in Monday's session, when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average picked up 21 points The most actively traded issue on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday was <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>, which jumped 1 -RRB- to 36 \ amid speculation that financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> was adding to his 11.4 percent stake in the company <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> was up 3 -LRB- to 59 -RCB- as the company's unionized machinists voted on whether to accept a new three-year contract or strike at midnight. After the market closed, it was announced that the machinists had turned down their tentative agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. Besides the blue chips, the biggest winners were consumer stocks, which boast predictable growth. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> gained 2 \ to 38 \ and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> soared 5 -RRB- to But those gains came at the expense of technology issues. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> skidded 2 | to 106 Analysts said the computer maker was suffering the fallout from last week's announcement that its third-quarter earnings would be below expectations. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market gained $ 32.764 billion, or 0.95 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks reached a new closing high, rising 1.94 to 196.84. New ground was also broken at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the market value index closed at 393.02, up 3.36. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index moved up 4.42 to 404.44, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index gained 3.84 to close at 354.71.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Rise Amid Panama Unrest</HEAD>

 Oil futures prices rose Tuesday, supported by concern about the unrest in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, gained 12 cents to close at $ 20.13 per 42-gallon barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said prices were buoyed by the turmoil in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where soldiers opposed to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> seized his headquarters in an attempt to oust him but loyalists counterattacked. Oil investors worried that the conflict could disrupt the movement of oil tankers through the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, although they recognized that event still appears unlikely. `` What we did not see was tremendous panic, -LRB- but -RRB- it lent a steady tone to the market,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, referring to the impact of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> situation. Home heating oil futures traded on the mercantile exchange also rose. The November contract for heating oil edged up 0.10 cent a gallon to close at 59.68 cents and subsequent months posted larger gains. The November contract for unleaded gasoline slipped 0.16 cent a gallon to 56.64 cents. Subsequent months advanced, however, with the December contract gaining 0.38 cent to 55.08 cents. <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON> said refined product prices drew further strength from reports that <ORGANIZATION> Amerada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns a big refinery in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, was experiencing delays in getting the facility back to normal operations in the wake of damage by Hurricane Hugo.

<HEAD>Bentsen Seeks Oil, Gas Tax For Wetlands Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> and Energy committees have included a new tax on off-shore oil and gas production in pending legislation and want to use the millions of dollars in expected revenues to protect and restore coastal wetlands. Spokesmen for the oil and gas industry say, however, that drilling on the outer-continental shelf has done little to harm the Gulf Coast's troubled wetlands. They said their industry is opposed to being solely responsible for financing the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wetlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> under the provision backed by the chairmen, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>. `` Since most of the causes of wetlands losses were unintended consequences of activities that provided public benefits, an equitable solution would be to fund wetlands conservation programs out of general revenues. It is unfair to tax a single industry to address a broad land-use problem,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastelic </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. Environmentalists, however, say off-shore drilling has damaged coastal wetlands in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and although outer-continental shelf drilling may not directly cause wetlands erosion, setting up and operating support facilities on the mainland have contributed to losses of coastal marshes. Under the plan drafted by <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., production from federal offshore waters would be taxed at 2 cents per 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas and 3 cents per barrel of oil Industry estimates say the plan would raise about $ 100 million annually, while the senators say revenues would be closer to $ 383 million over five years. The plan is included in <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s version of what is known as budget reconciliation legislation pending before the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is chairman. There have been no hearings on the plan. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said late Monday that getting the tax included in the reconciliation bill was `` the difficult part'' of moving the plan through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The bill is the chief legislative vehicle for enacting spending cuts to meet budget targets. According to a fact sheet from <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>'s office, wetlands loss on the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> is critical, especially in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>'s office also said oil and gas activity is one cause of erosion in coastal wetlands, which provide habitat for migratory birds, fish and other ildlife, as well as commercial and recreational benefits `` Navigation, access and pipeline canals and other activities related to the exploration, development and production of oil and gas along the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> and on the outer continental shelf have had adverse effects on many of the coastal wetlands of the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> region,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>'s office said. `` Oil and gas production in the coastal areas have contributed -LRB- to wetlands losses -RRB-. I would n't say it's the No. 1 factor, but they have contributed their part,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Reffalt </PERSON>, refuge program director for the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Baly </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said natural gas is `` probably less than 10 percent of the problem.'' <PERSON> Baly </PERSON> said the natural gas industry would pay the greatest share of the tax _ accounting for 91 percent of what the association projects will be $ 98 million in annual revenues. `` At a time when 50 percent of our oil comes from foreign countries and concern about reducing our deficit from oil imports, it's difficult for us to understand why they're lessening the competitive factor for natural gas by applying a federal tax,'' <PERSON> Baly </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Feierabend </PERSON>, director of the fisheries and wildlife division at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, said he would support the <LOCATION> Bentsen-Johnston </LOCATION> approach. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Monday his plan would `` be a great thing for the coastal waters, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Crazy Eddie Says It Will Liquidate Remaining Assets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNION, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Crazy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the discount electronics chain known for its high-pitched commercials, turned down the volume for good Tuesday, announcing it would liquidate its last 18 stores. The company, which had been seeking to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws, said it would liquidate because vendors were no longer willing to extend credit, among other factors. Without the credit, it could not keep operating, the company said. Because liabilities greatly exceeded assets, stockholders would receive nothing, it said. Trading had been suspended when the share price fell below 25 cents. Managers were told of the planned closings during a morning meeting at the company's headquarters in <LOCATION> Edison </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Crazy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eddie </ORGANIZATION> store here. `` It was kind of like a load being lifted off your shoulders,'' he said. The announcement ends a turbulent 20-year history for the company founded by high-school dropout <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Antar </PERSON> with a lone store in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. At its peak, <PERSON> Crazy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> had 43 stores in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> They employed 1,500 people and once brought in sales of $ 300 million. The company's stock reached $ 21 a share. The tag line `` Our prices are insane,'' screamed so often on television and radio spots by former disc jockey-actor <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, made the chain known to millions. But a rift among Antar family members who served as executives, declining demand for electronics, tougher competition and seeming disorganization brought on severe financial woes. Antar, who brought the company public in 1984, later sold much of his stock, and resigned as president but stayed on as chairman. He dropped from sight and never granted interviews. Dissident shareholders, led by turnaround specialist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmieri </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> electronics retailer <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinn </PERSON>, took control of the company in November 1987 and found a huge inventory shortfall. Nearly three months after <PERSON> Crazy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> sought bankruptcy protection in June, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> accused Antar and top management with insider trading and systematically doctoring financial figures to inflate earnings. The scheme allegedly involved exaggerating inventory and falsely reducing bills to suppliers. Meanwhile, at the store here, the floor contained compact disc players and other stereo equipment in their boxes and pyramids of Mr. Coffee machines. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said he wanted to show customers that the store had goods to sell, but conceded that the stock room was far from brimming over. `` This is my job, my livelihood,'' said <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>. `` But you've got to make the best of it,'' he said, confident he could find work in the computer industry. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> vowed to go out of business in the `` Crazy <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> tradition'' _ `` blow-out blitzes.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted Tuesday to cut off debate on long-stalled legislation that would require creation of a commission to investigate the lengthy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike. Senators voted narrowly to invoke cloture, getting 61 votes, just one more than necessary to limit debate. Thirty-six senators voted against ending the filibuster by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans. The Republicans had been backing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s refusal to appoint an emergency board, under provisions of the Railway Labor Act, to probe the strike, led by <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, which began March 4. A spokesman for Eastern termed `` ludicrous'' the legislation being considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's hard to believe at a time when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is so bogged down in matters of great importance to the country, that it would take this much time to deal with ludicrous legislation on behalf of special interests,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he would veto such a bill, and there are `` more than enough'' votes in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to sustain a presidential veto, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. In a separate development Tuesday, a federal bankruptcy judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> released $ 75 million from escrow to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and gave the troubled carrier permission to sell a $ 30 million note that it owns. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action breaks a parliamentary jam holding up consideration of a measure mandating establishment of a three-person commission to study the work stoppage and make recommendations for its solution. There was no immediate indication when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would proceed to a vote on the bill. Under cloture rules, no senator may talk for more than an hour after debate has been cut off. This usually means there would be no more than 30 to 40 hours of further debate, since it takes 60 senators in the 100-member chamber to invoke cloture. Democrats had said last week that if they were successful in achieving a cutoff of debate, they would then substitute union-backed language for the House-passed bill, creating a commission with one member each appointed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. `` I think, in fairness, we should invoke cloture,'' Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, told colleagues before Tuesday's vote `` I believe that we owe nothing less to the workers of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>.'' Since March, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have used delaying tactics to block the chamber's consideration of House-passed legislation requiring <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint an emergency board. The president has refused to create a board, saying management and employees should resolve the problem. But <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said it was time to force <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s hand. `` It is now obvious that the president will not appoint an emergency board,'' he said. `` It is now obvious that unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> takes action, the president is content to do nothing ... while the families of 30,000 Eastern workers suffer.'' Five days after the Machinists struck <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, joined by pilots and flight attendants, the carrier filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code. Eastern has been continuing efforts to reorganize in bankruptcy court and the airline has said it plans to emerge as a carrier two-thirds its former size.

 The dollar rose against most major currencies Tuesday despite continued central bank intervention as the crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> boosted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. Gold prices declined. Foreign exchange analysts said intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and other central banks continued but at a less aggressive pace than last week. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized nations agreed more than a week ago to sell dollars and buy other currencies in a concerted effort to drive the dollar lower. `` The dollar was well bid throughout the entire day today,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Montschein </PERSON>, managing director of foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` The intervention was across the board but it was n't massive.'' The seven nations in the group are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Currency analysts said the dollar's rise was led by a failure to push up the struggling yen. `` The dollar was well bid because of the yen,'' said <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Samuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` When it was unable to hold at 140 and broke above due to strong dollar demand, we saw a good variety of short covering which brought the dollar-yen up further.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose 1.35 yen to a closing 140.65 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 141.10 yen, up from 139.25 late Monday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar traded at 141.20 yen, up from 139.70. News that the goverment of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> might have been overthrown in a coup also gave the dollar a slight kick, currency traders said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials later reported that the coup had failed. `` It was the flight-to-safety phenomenon,'' <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6055 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.6175 late Monday. The pound fell to $ 1.6045 compared with $ 1.6135 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.8865 West German marks, up from 1,8795; 1.6350 Swiss francs, up from 1.6285; 1.1749 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1782; 6.4000 French francs, up from 6.3745; and 1,379.65 Italian lire, up from 1,3740 Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.8865 West German marks, up from 1.8750; 1.6350 Swiss francs, up from 1.6240; 6.4005 French francs, up from 6.3595; 2.1195 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1140; 1,380.50 Italian lire, up from 1,366.50; and 1.1763 Canadian dollars, down from 1.7772. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 365.50 a troy ounce, compared with late Monday's $ 366.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid $ 365.25 compared with $ 366.40 late Monday. Gold in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> fell 75 cents to close at a bid $ 366.50. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $ 366.30 an ounce, down from $ 367.60 on Monday. Later Republic National bank of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said gold was bid at $ 365.50 an ounce, down from Monday's $ 366.10. Silver bullion prices fell on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 5.22 a troy ounce, compared with Monday's $ 5.23.

<HEAD>Activity to Increase This Year, Decline in 1990, Survey Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least a third of the major oil and gas companies plan to spend more on exploration and production this year, but most forecast a drop in prices and activity in 1990, an industry report said Tuesday. Thirty-three percent of the major integrated companies responding to PI's annual mid-year survey said exploration expenditures this year would exceed those of 1988, while 22 percent said the expenditures would decrease, according to Petroleum Information, a Denver-based research arm of <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Thirty-nine percent of the independent operators said they would spend more on exploration, 21 percent said they would spend less and 40 percent said spending would be unchanged, PI said For the first three quarters of 1989, new field wildcat completions declined 31 percent from the same period in 1988. However, the operators' spending expectations, coupled with depressed levels of exploration activity earlier this year, indicate increased exploration in the fourth quarter, the report said. Forty-three percent of the companies surveyed said production-related expenditures would increase, 38 percent planned no change and 17 percent said they would decrease, PI said. Operators forecast a drop in prices and activity next year with the price for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude expected to average $ 17.45 a barrel, compared with the 1989 year-to-date average of $ 19 per barrel; the average spot price of natural gas would be $ 1.57 per thousand cubic feet, compared with the 12-month average to date of $ 1.60, the company said. The companies predicted that the Baker-Hughes 1990 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rig count would average 859 in 1990, compared with the most recent count of 978, PI said. The survey said 44 percent of the major integrated companies reported their No. 1 geographic focus would be domestic offshore prospects next year, followed by domestic onshore and international prospects. Eighty-five percent of the independent operators said domestic onshore targets would be their No. 1 priority, and 8 percent said their leading focus would be offshore prospects. The remaining operators said they would focus on international prospects. The survey findings supported a widely perceived shift toward natural gas production with 51 percent of the respondents saying they would emphasize gas prospects over oil. Nearly 69 percent of the respondents said their plans called for at least an even split between oil and natural gas. PI said 51 percent of the 1988 survey respondents said they planned such a split. Petroleum Information offers reporting services, data, data analysis and other exploration services to petroleum and related industries.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> started one of the nation's largest black-owned companies together with $ 250 in 1954, but the family ties that bound the company and the couple have come undone. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> signed the company chairmanship and the bulk of its shares over to her this week in their divorce settlement. <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> makes hair-care and cosmetics under such brand names as Gentle-Treatment, Ultra Sheen and Classy Curl. `` This is a family company and she wanted to preserve the company for the family, the children. And she obviously feels that she can make this company into something even better than it is today,'' <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinella </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s divorce lawyer, said Tuesday. She and the couple's eldest son, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, will seek to guide <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> back to profitability after eight straight years of losses, he said. The company's stock closed up 12 -LCB- cents Tuesday at $ 2.50 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 62, who had been the company's principal shareholder, turned his stock over to his former wife and resigned as chairman and chief executive officer on Monday, when the divorce was granted. Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 60, formerly the company treasurer, replaced him as chairman and now owns or controls 61 percent of the personal-product company's common stock. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who has been president of the company since December, was named chief executive officer. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> will stay on as a consultant. He also is chairman of the holding company that owns <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The changes were approved Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>' board of directors. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boutte </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> board of directors, declined to elaborate on the move. `` This was strictly a family affair. They amicably agreed to do it this way,'' said <PERSON> Boutte </PERSON>. He added he did not expect radical changes at the company. `` <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> has really been running the company on a day-to-day basis,'' <PERSON> Boutte </PERSON> said. Other terms of the settlement were not disclosed, and <PERSON> Rinella </PERSON> said the divorce records were impounded and not available to the public. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, did not return telephone calls to his office. Neither <PERSON> George </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> could be reached through the company on Tuesday. <PERSON> Rinella </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, which is completing an internal reorganization begun 18 months ago, would benefit from the management change. `` I think she can turn it around,'' he said. The divorce action had been pending for more than a year while the two sides discussed terms of the settlement, including the change in ownership of the company, <PERSON> Rinella </PERSON> said. Asked whether <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had considered selling the company instead of turning it over, <PERSON> Rinella </PERSON> said it `` could have been an option ... but that never developed.'' The Johnsons founded the company in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and it became the first black-owned company traded on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in 1971. While the company has lost money for the past eight years, it posted small gains in the past two quarters. The company reported a loss of $ 3.7 million on sales of $ 29.1 million in fiscal 1988. The company registered a $ 2.2 million one-time gain in the first quarter of its 1989 fiscal year after selling land near its South Side headquarters. <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> was 17th on this year's list of the nation's 100 largest black-owned companies, compiled by <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> magazine

<HEAD>Legal Specialist: Retirees May Be Out of Reach of Age Settlement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A $ 35 million age discrimination settlement _ the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s largest ever _ may be out of reach for 4,000 <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> retirees following two <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions, a legal specialist said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday vacated an appeals court ruling that <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> discriminated against the retirees by offering them a choice of either severance pay or early pensions, but not both. The appeals court must now reconsider <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION>'s charges against <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>, in light of a June <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that tilts the discrimination law in favor of employers. The <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> had a $ 35 million settlement in hand in August 1988 but walked away from it to seek a court ruling that could have led to an even bigger payment for the retirees. `` It means they blew it. They got greedy,'' <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauver </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> pension lawyer who was not involved in the case, said Monday night. `` They chose to forgo a very favorable settlement to get a favorable court decision.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, executive assistant to the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> general counsel, said Tuesday that <PERSON> Lauver </PERSON> `` knows nothing of the settlement and knows nothing of the settlement process and maybe he's not adequately familiar with the case.'' <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> believed that up to 10,000 <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> retirees might have qualified to share in the settlement, but the two sides could not agree on guidelines for identifying additional retirees. In addition, the settlement would have required the agency to approve a future benefits plan that was too similar to the one the 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> deemed illegal. <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> said that `` $ 35 million seemed to be an inadequate settlement.'' The case was pending before the federal appeals court when the two sides settled. After the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> backed away, the appeals court took up the case again and ruled against <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>. The company appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> early this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s June ruling came in an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> case. The court said employees have the burden of proving that the employer intended to discriminate. Before the decision, employers had to demonstrate why the disputed programs were not discriminatory. `` The law is much more beneficial to <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> than it was in June,'' <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> said. `` Right now, I do n't know what this case is worth.'' A number of issues remain to be decided in the <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> case, he said. `` I think the case is far from over,'' <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> said. The June ruling could affect about 30 cases pending in the courts, said <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. An additional 406 complaints still being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> could also be affected, she said. Three bills have been introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would restore the law to its terms before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s June decision, although not all of them would be retroactive. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is looking forward to having the appeals cour reconsider its case, said company spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>. `` Westinghouse is delighted,'' he said.

Last week <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> agreed to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3.4 billion and to pay $ 200 million for <ORGANIZATION> Guber-Peters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a film and television production company that <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> head <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> recently signed five-year contracts to make films for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, including a sequel to <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s summer box office smash, `` Batman.'' In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> disclosed that it had entered into an agreement with <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> that would pay them each $ 2.75 million a year for the first 30 months of a five-year contract and $ 2.90 million a year for the remaining 30 months, ending March 31, 1995. The salary will be `` adjusted annually to reflect the increase, if any, in the cost of living,'' according to the filing. In addition, <PERSON> Guber </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> and `` a group of individual executives not to exceed five'' to help them manage the new company will be entitled to `` a portion of a bonus pool based on the earnings before interest and taxes of -LRB- the new company -RRB- and an equity participation based on a set formula pursuant to which the management will be entitled to receive in the aggregate up to 8.08 percent of the increase in a formula-based market value of -LRB- the new entity -RRB- over a five-year period,'' the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing said. <PERSON> Guber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> would be paid less if <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> does not acquire <ORGANIZATION> Guber-Peters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, according to the filing.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> ICH </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday a restructuring of its holdings through the sale of all but two of its insurance subsidiaries, including a $ 495 million deal with an investor group put together by a former partner in the <ORGANIZATION> Hicks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> leveraged buyout firm. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Muse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it would purchase four operating companies with assets of $ 2 billion from <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, Ky.-based ICH. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, <PERSON> Muse </PERSON> had offered in July to take over the entire company for $ 425 million in cash and the assumption of $ 1.69 billion in debt and preferred stock. The announcement was made after the close of stock trading. ICH's stock had edged down 12 -LCB- cents to $ 5.25 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The Dallas-based firm was formed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muse </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, a founding partner of <ORGANIZATION> Hicks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Haas, which included Dr Pepper and Seven-Up beverage companies among its acquisitions. The partnership, which invested $ 4 billion during its four-year existence, broke up on May 11, citing philosophical differences. `` We see real opportunities in the life insurance industry,'' <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said. The operating companies purchased by <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Muse </ORGANIZATION> are <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, and three Denver-based firms: <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wabash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The companies' headquarters will remain in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and current management, including ICH president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, will remain on board, <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, <PERSON> Muse </PERSON> said. As part of the deal, ICH will purchase $ 35 million in preferred stock in <ORGANIZATION> HMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, <PERSON> Muse </PERSON>'s purchasing vehicle, and will own 19 percent of the common shares of HMS Acquisition. ICH also announced it had signed a letter of intent to sell <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 145 million to <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. Both deals are subject to various regulatory approvals and are expected to close by the end of the year. ICH Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said the sales were part of a restructuring plan to increase book value, cash flow and earnings. ICH will retain <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The two subsidiaries accounted for 73 percent of ICH's assets on June 30, 1989. `` The availability of the proceeds -LRB- of the sales -RRB- for use in repayment of senior bank debt and the repurchase of our outstanding debt and equity securities is vital to our commitment to improve our shareholder value,'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. ICH said it would book one-time losses of about $ 85 million this year because of the deals and the writedowns of assets held by various subsidiaries.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday unveiled new ads for its Infiniti luxury car line that finally gives a glimpse _ if a fuzzy one _ of a nameplate previously wrapped in advertising mystery. The new ads are to begin appearing later this month as part of a $ 60 million print and television campaign by the Japansese automaker that so far has lacked direct reference to either of the two Infiniti models. The new television commercials continue the style of pastoral scenery but now include a blurry car whizzing past at the close. The changes in the ad campaign begin Oct. 16 nationally and Oct. 23 in the 30 markets where there are Infiniti dealers, Infiniti Division General Manager <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> said. He said more commercials will air Nov. 5 but declined to say whether the Infiniti Q45 or M30 cars would appear in them. The cars go on sale Nov. 8. The Infiniti cars are the second Japanese luxury car line to be introduced this year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> began selling its Lexus line last month. Lexus officials have said they anticipate selling around 70,000 vehicles in 1990. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>, which changed its name from <LOCATION> Datsun </LOCATION> earlier this decade, is attempting to make the name Infiniti familiar to potential buyers before the car itself, using brand rather than product advertising. `` I find them a breath of fresh air and rather intriguing,'' said automotive analyst <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I hear everybody talking about it. I suppose you have to give them credit in breaking new ground in automotive advertising.'' But analyst <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said, `` My personal belief is that to sell a car, you should show a car.'' The new ads were shown at what <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> called the national media introduction of the Infiniti cars, which will sell for $ 23,500 and $ 38,000. The cars also were shown on the auto-show circuit earlier this year. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> declined to say how many cars the division expected to sell. The line's print ads to date have shown such nature-oriented scenes as an outcropping of rocks, crashing waves or a field of hay along with often-philosophical text that does not prominently mention the name of the car.

 <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it would consolidate its property-casualty operations as part of a major management reorganization. Farmers Chairman <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> also said the company would conduct a multimillion-dollar study to examine how to make its computerized business systems more efficient. H.J. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, a vice president of field operations, was promoted to senior vice president and chief information officer to oversee the study, reporting to <LOCATION> Denlea </LOCATION>. Leading the host of new jobs and reassignments, <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> said he had appointed <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Braddock </PERSON> to a new No. 2 post as executive vice president of the Los Angeles-based insurer. The move will allow <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> to concentrate more on life insurance and the reorganization of business systems, officials said. <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> said he also would nominate <PERSON> Braddock </PERSON>, formerly the vice president of marketing, to the board of directors. Farmers spokesman <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> said the restructuring was part of a process that <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> launched two years ago and was unrelated to the uncertainties surrounding a hostile takeover bid for Farmers' parent, the British <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> conglomerate. Farmers, the 15th-biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> insurer, was acquired last year by London-based BAT, which is now trying to fight off a $ 22 billion takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium put together by investor Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Poultry Firm Says Contract Signed To Supply Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGDALE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Poultry giant <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Springdale </LOCATION> said Tuesday it had signed a contract to provide chicken parts to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said the contract was signed with another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food company, which he declined to name, that has agreed to supply the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with chicken. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> also declined to disclose volume or price figures, saying non-disclosure of that information was part of the contract. `` The Russians have committed themselves to a major purchasing program of consumer items, including food, and this is simply part of the program,'' said <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s general counsel. He declined to say when the contract was signed, but said it was announced to Tyson management Monday. According to <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, the contract calls for a substantial amount of frozen chicken hindquarters _ thighs and legs _ to be shipped in containers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports, where the containers would be transferred to cargo ships for transport to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Shipments are to begin `` almost immediately,'' he said. The effect on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chicken market will be very limited, he said. `` It wo n't do anything to the American market except add stability, as any big contract does over a period of time,'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said. `` In fact, there wo n't be any disruption in the supply to our normal customers.'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said the contract is with a company with which <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> normally competes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He would not say whether the company was either <ORGANIZATION> Conagra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Perdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION>, Md. The multicompany arrangement, he said, arose because `` I do n't think any single company would have the capacity to fulfill the contract'' without disruption of its normal operations He said that, as far as he knew, the arrangements with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> involve no export subsidy by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The sale by <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said, was at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market prices, as was the sale to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by the company with which <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> has contracted.

 Threatening a fresh trade spat with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> foreign ministers Tuesday agreed to push their television stations to air a majority of home-grown _ not foreign _ entertainment programs. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has argued the measure would hurt the American film and television industry's earnings abroad and suggested it might violate international trade rules. Despite strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lobbying in recent months, the foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> approved a plan that would remove barriers to TV broadcasting in the 12-nation trading bloc. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> opposed the measure, according to community spokesmen. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangemann </PERSON>, the community's top official on industrial matters, said criticism of the measure was unjustified. `` It can not constitute an infringement of international trade rules,'' he told reporters. There was no immediate reaction from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. The plan, Television Without Frontiers, is part of the community's move to create a single market of 320 million consumers in late 1992. By the end of 1992 the dozen nations are scheduled to remove the many trade barriers restricting the free movement of money, goods, services and people. The TV measure set out the conditions under which broadcasters in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would be allowed to transmit channels throughout the trading bloc. In doing so, it said governments must ensure that a majority of transmission time be reserved _ `` where practicable and by appropriate means'' _ for European-made programs. Excluded from the provision were news, sports and games programs as well as ads. British Foreign Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said there were assurances that the measure would not be regarded as applying legally binding quotas. `` We clearly wanted to avoid ... a Fortress <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the fears of a <ORGANIZATION> Fortress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION>,'' he told reporters. The measure, he said, was `` seen as political objectives and not a numerical straitjacket.'' `` It's not a legal obligation,'' said <PERSON> Bangemann </PERSON>. `` It's a political commitment.'' King said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would not change its treatment of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> programs. About 15 percent of the programs broadcst by major British stations comes from outside the community, he said. `` Any fans of ` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' or ` Dynasty' need have no doubt whatsoever that they will continue to get their programs,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has urged the community to scrap the plan. The American entertainment industry said its European earnings would be seriously hurt by such a restriction. During a European swing last month, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> reiterated the American opposition. `` We are not in favor of local content in any context and more particularly in the province of thoughts,'' she said. Local content provisions refer to measures requiring that a certain percentage of a product be produced domestically. Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> had earlier written key members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the community's legislative body, to complain about the TV measure. Community quotas, she wrote, `` would be blatantly discriminatory, patently unjustifiable, and would almost certainly have a disastrous effect on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry's substantial European earnings.'' Defenders of quotas argued that European culture was at stake. They fear a flood of American soap operas, sitcoms and other programs would tie up the airwaves.
