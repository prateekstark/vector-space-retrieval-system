 Former West German Chancellor <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said Monday he hopes some of the crumbling <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall will stand permanently, not as a barrier but as a reminder of the Cold War. `` A part of it should be allowed to remain standing, to serve as something of a museum,'' said <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, who was mayor of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> when the wall was erected in 1961. East German officials have opened new passages through the wall but have made it clear they will leave much of it standing for now to continue marking the line between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, 75, said he was deeply moved when he visited <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> over the weekend and watched people freely moving through _ and over _ the wall. He said he would never forget how, for the first time, he saw East German border guards smiling at East German residents as they passed through border control points. `` They were so friendly. And the -LRB- East -RRB- Berliners who came back called over to the police _ ` Hey look, we're back!''' Even though <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> is from the northern city of <LOCATION> Luebeck </LOCATION>, there are few politicians in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> whose personal histories are so closely linked with the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. He rose to world prominence in 1961 when <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> constructed the wall, which became the scene of dozens of fatal escape attempts. Angered by the wall's deadly threat to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berliners </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> immediately condemned the structure as a human rights violation. In an interview shown Monday night on the Macneil-Lehrer NewsHour broadcast in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> was reminded of his anger in 1961 when the three <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allies </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ did nothing to tear the wall down and he was asked if President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was right not to take action. `` I never asked President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to take military action,'' <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said. `` What I was angry about at the time ... was that there had been so much talk about the four-power responsibility -LRB- the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Allies </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> -RRB- for <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> as a whole and when it came to a critical point, we had to acknowledge that four-power responsibility had to be reduced to a three-party responsibility for <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` I was happy that we could count on that protection _ responsibility and protection. No, I think looking back at it, it was the right thing not to take the kind of military action which could have brought us into a new World War.'' <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said he thinks <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> should not intervene in what is happening in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but be ready to offer its help. `` Leave it to people in the other part of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to find their proper answers to their problems, but be as helpful as possible, especially in the field of economic cooperation,'' he said.

 A hotel executive's husband was arrested Monday and accused of bludgeoning her to death on her 44th birthday with unopened wine bottles in their luxury apartment. `` This was a domestic dispute that escalated into a violent confrontation,'' said police Deputy Inspector <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, 45, was charged with second-degree murder early Monday, a day after police went to the couple's apartment in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and found the battered body of his wife, <PERSON> Sharyn </PERSON>, 44, said <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON>. The couple had been married 17 years. Mrs. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a personnel director with <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, had turned 44 Sunday, the day she was slain, <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> said. `` There was a lot of blood,'' said detective Sgt. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>. `` She was very badly beaten.'' Investigators believe Mrs. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> was bludgeoned to death with up to five unopened wine bottles, which were found shattered near her body. `` A wooden meat tenderizer, like a mallet, was found near the body,'' <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> added. The argument between the couple apparently escalated Sunday afternoon, when neighbors heard screams coming from the apartment in <LOCATION> Battery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> near the financial district. After the killing, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, covered with blood, left the apartment and stood in the hallway shouting for help, <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> said. Police responding to neighbors calls arrived at the apartment. The distraught husband, a self-employed food and beverage consultant, had scratch marks on his face and hands. Cole was restrained by police. `` He was visibly upset,'' <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> said. `` He did n't want to leave the body.''

 `` Ach, the stinking fumes from those terrible one-lung wrecks! Who would have thought pollution was the smell of freedom?'' With that, cabbie <PERSON> Augustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> left the wheel of his <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> taxi and helped a laughing, cheering crowd of West Berliners push another backfiring `` Trabbi,'' the East German two-cylinder car, through the newly opened hole in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall at <LOCATION> Potsdamer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platz </LOCATION>. Two blue-bereted French soldiers amused the crowd and shocked the children peering out the streaky windows of the stalled car by chipping away at the Wall with hammers and chisels. The big weekend shopping spree that saw 3 million East Germans live the fantasies that tantalized them for years on western TV had slowed from a torrent to a steady gush, but every daylight hour was still rush hour on the streets of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. You had to wait in line to get into <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s on <ORGANIZATION> Tauentzien </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strasse </ORGANIZATION>, but on the opposite side of Checkpoint Charlie sales girls looked out the windows of empty boutiques with names like `` Lotus'' and `` Panda'' along <ORGANIZATION> Leipziger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strasse </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s fashion avenue. Shoppers hurried through the chilling fog with baby carriages, shopping carts and rucksacks crammed with free world goodies. Even a sale on the eastern side _ `` stark reduziert'' _ of snuggie wool damen slips, ladies' almost knee-length panties from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, at 4 marks and Russian-made <PERSON> Strumpf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hose </PERSON>, at 14 marks, failed to stem the exodus to the big mall over the Wall. A surpising consensus of sidewalk opinion along the Kurfuerstendamm, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Fifth Avenue, blamed the fog on the fume-spewing Trabants and the slightly larger Wartburgs. `` Still it's a miracle to see all those DDR plates,'' enthused refrigeration repairman <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Esser </PERSON>, who played hookey from work to spend his third day watching the flow of traffic through the Wall. `` This has been the happiest time of my life. I was two years old when the Wall went up. I'm taking pictures for my infant son, who hopefully wo n't even have the Wall, as a memory.'' `` Oranges, bananas and coffee, that's what the Easties mainly buy with the 100 marks handed out free to them by the banks,'' reported <PERSON> Helga </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosmunsen </PERSON>, a beautician who also called in sick to spend another day watching the ceaseless flow of humanity along a dust-beaten thoroughfare that only a week ago had been a death strip. `` Even on a crowded downtown street you can tell an East from a West Berliner by the happiness in their eyes. No wonder. Have you ever tried to get real coffee over there?'' Absenteeism was only a minor problem as another work week began in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, but the weekend of wonders glowed brighter than the few Christmas tree lights looming faintly in the fog. The Volkskammer, the Communist-dominated parliament, was electing a new prime minister in the old town hall up by the <LOCATION> Brandenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>, but at a Bierstube just a few blocks away blue-collar beer drinkers switched off the government television news to see if the Western channels were reporting any new holes in the Schandmauer, the wall of shame. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Brandenburg Gate, now sheared of its barbed wire curls, a procession of famous Western TV anchors from several dozen countries waited their turn to do stand-ups in the floodlit splendor of this landmark rubbled arch. Even at the Museum at <ORGANIZATION> Checkpoint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charlie </ORGANIZATION> _ with its bizarre collection of motorbikes, battered buses, homemade submarines and hot-air balloons that had confounded <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s wall guards, patrol dogs and mine fields _ <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> and crew had to line up for an interview with the curators. At the CSSR Kultur und Informationszentrum just a few hundred yards to the east, there was no wait for interviews and no culture customers either, despite a display of children's patriotic poster art. `` The Easties will be back in even larger numbers this weekend,'' predicted postcard vendor <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> at the Potsdamer hole in the wall. `` This time it wo n't be for just shopping. They'll want to see our famous zoo and the Rembrandts and the Head of Queen <PERSON> Nefertiti </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Dahlem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION>. They know free <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has more to offer than blue jeans and cassettes of the British rock group Exodus.''

<HEAD>There's No Reward for Being a Whistleblower, Senate Panel Told</HEAD>

 The federal government should reward _ not punish _ workers who blow the whistle on fraud, say employees in telling a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee how they were thwarted in efforts to expose abuse. `` There's no reward for being a whistleblower,'' complained a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> worker in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> who went public with allegations about a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> defense contractor. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusen </PERSON> said Monday that the government saved $ 3.3 million on a contract when she brought allegations of fraud to their attention, but all she got in return were two lines of commendation. `` When someone finds a wallet, they get a reward,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Governmental Affairs subcommittee on general services, federalism and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, which held a hearing into the inspectors general fraud hotlines. The 16-year federal employee described for the committee her nearly five-year effort to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to investigate pricing irregularities by the <ORGANIZATION> Elliott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, then a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Twenty-six letters to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> hotline describing contract problems, including some with audit reports, progress payment records and copies of contracts, produced little action, <PERSON> Kusen </PERSON> said Finally, she took her information to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. After a series of articles in the newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detachment </ORGANIZATION> conducted its own inquiry. The Detachment found that on an order for 26 rotor assemblies, <ORGANIZATION> Elliott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> charged $ 6,613.49 for items that should have been $ 1,485.89, Ms. <PERSON> Kusen </PERSON> said. Federal employees fear retaliation for reporting waste and abuse, said the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> worker who said she would never use the hotline again. <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, an employee with the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION> who blew the whistle on a land scandal, said he never considered the inspectors general hotline. `` Friends ... said the reaction would be one of damage control,'' <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> told the committee. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Diefenderfer </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency, said the testimony was `` the most demoralizing thing I've heard.'' But he said he did not think `` it is that bad,'' and suggested an increase in congressional oversightof the day-to-day operations of the inspectors general hotline. <PERSON> Dina </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasor </PERSON>, director of the Project on Military Procurement which recently released a 52-page survival guide for the whistleblower, said one problem with the system is that confidential complaints to the hotline, after proceeding through the investigative channels, usually end up on the desk of the whistleblower's boss, and `` it does n't take long to find out who the employee is.'' The other problem is that investigators rarely work with the whistleblower on their inquiries. `` They go through a stack of documents without understanding the problem,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rasor </PERSON> said. `` I've never known a whistleblower to be successful with the hotline,'' said <PERSON> Rasor </PERSON>, who has spent nine years investigating the military. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said their study of the hotline system found that some telephone hotline numbers were not listed and others did not have an 800-number, like the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. Overall, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the hotlines `` can be useful in receiving calls and complaints.''

 <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, the first black to be elected governor of any state, says the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> should follow his example in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> by offering a moderate, `` mainstream'' message in presidential elections. `` In presidential elections it is time for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to take a plunge into the waters of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s new mainstream,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> told a gathering of party leaders Monday. `` There was a time when Democrats were elected by campaigning against big government and high taxes,'' he said. `` But for too long, we have let the other party take these issues away from us _ indeed, we have allowed them to hammer us with these issues.'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s lieutenant governor, spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a group of conservative and moderate Democrats formed in 1985 to counteract liberals who have dominated the party's presidential nominating process. The group has tried to steer the party toward the right, and <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> has bickered publicly with the group and some of its leaders in the past. After taking office in 1986, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> criticized the council as exclusionary and divisive, and he charged it was trying to weaken the influence of the party's basic constituency groups, including blacks. Noting those past differences, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said: `` I will not look back. We will look for forward. We will be there together.'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said his campaign was successful because it appealed to mainstream values. To regain the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Democrats must identify with the nation's concerns about crime and drugs, jobs, the environment, education and the desire `` to hold the line on taxes,'' he said. Although his candidacy was closely watched by black leaders, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> deliberately kept liberal two-time presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at arm's length and did not invite <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to campaign for him. `` Mainstream values are the values of the overwhelming majority of the people of this country,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said. `` It's time our party began focusing on such values at the national level.'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, whose razor-thin victory is subject to a recount requested by his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opponent, campaigned as a moderate in the tradition of his two predecessors, Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, a former governor and president of the <ORGANIZATION> DLC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s call on the party to embrace mainstream values as the key to regaining the White House used a common buzz-word for the council. <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, in a morning address to the group, used the word `` mainstream'' no fewer than 21 times, and the inaugural issue of the group's new magazine was distributed bearing the title `` The Mainstream Democrat.'' `` Stand pat with liberal fundamentalism, or build a new agenda on mainstream values _ that is the choice,'' <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> said. Speaking to reporters later, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> lavished praise on the council but stopped short of saying he would join. The party's other top elected black, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, is a co-chairman of the council and has urged <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> to join <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> before the group, saying, `` He will change the course of American politics, not because he is black, but because of what as a black American he will do.''

<TEXT>
 Despite prodding from Democrats, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is reacting cautiously to democratic reform in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, saluting the developments as momentous and irreversible while trying to avoid any appearance of gloating. It is a balancing act, intended to lend support and encouragement to the march toward freedom while guarding against doing anything that might provoke a crackdown in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or slow the dramatic pace of reform. `` We are handling it in a way where we are not trying to give anybody a hard time,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last week. He said he was responding in `` a rather measured way'' that was designed to encourage change and `` hopefully not contribute to an unforeseen disorder.'' Now, two well-placed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is considering a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> after his summit next month with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The aim of such a meeting would be to show Western unity on the future of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and to discuss new political and military strategy in light of the changes in Eastern and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s initial approach to the opening of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s borders was so low-keyed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> felt obliged to explain: `` I am not an emotional kind of guy. I'm very pleased.'' Questioned Monday about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s restrained reaction, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I urge you not to mistake that for the personal enthusiasm for the freedom and the extension of values that are now going to the East German people.'' An administration official, discussing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s approach, said, `` Things are going so well in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, why screw them up'' by saying something provocative. `` We do n't need to say, ` We won, they lost.''' Democrats have been attacking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> all year as too timid and hesitant about changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and across <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and they unveiled a new volley Monday. `` Even as the walls of the modern <PERSON> Jericho </PERSON> come tumbling down, we have a president who is inadequate to the moment,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. `` The changes taking place in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> should galvanize our president into action,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` But at the very time freedom and democracy are receiving standing ovations in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, our president is sitting politely in the audience with little to say and even less to contribute.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to go to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to hail `` the figurative and literal destruction of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall.'' He also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should swiftly suspend trade barriers against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and grant <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> observer status at international economic institutions. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said it was `` extremely unlikely'' that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would go to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` It's our feeling that there are any number of policy reasons why that is probably not the right thing to do at this time.'' While cheering the developments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the administration acknowledges it has been surprised by the pace of change and is uncertain where events will lead. Preparing for his summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Dec. 2 and 3, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met Monday with a panel of academic and government experts on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The meeting focused on military developments in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Earlier sessions were devoted to the Kremlin's economic problems <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, particularly in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, are putting a new focus on the summit. `` Certainly, the exodus from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the taking down of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, in terms of people's ability to move across the borders, adds a new sense of urgency and a new dimension to that whole discussion,'' the spokesman said. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not be accompanied to the summit by a large number of arms control specialists, but that the talks should `` give a push'' to negotiations to reduce strategic nuclear arms and conventional weapons. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned up the rhetorical heat on developments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> during an emotional ceremony Monday welcoming Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to the White House. `` The iron curtain is fast becoming a rusted, abandoned relic, symbolizing a lost era and a failed ideology,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The change is everywhere,'' the president said. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. And ladies and gentlemen, the week that brought <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, is the week the headlines proclaimed, ` And the Wall Comes Tumbling Down.'''

 Democratic senators from five states that have federal nuclear weapons facilities want President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to withdraw his nomination of <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to head weapons production, saying he's unqualified for the sensitive post. In a letter made public Monday, the senators said the poor condition of the nation's 12-state nuclear weapons complex makes it crucial that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> find someone of undisputed credentials for the job of assistant secretary for defense programs. `` Unfortunately, based upon his record of circumventing health and safety regulations and obstructing investigations while at the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, we strongly believe that Mr. <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> is not the proper candidate for this responsibility and that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should reject his confirmation,'' the letter said. Stello's confirmation hearing is scheduled for Wednesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. His nomination was announced July 24 by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The letter opposing the nomination was signed by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> is on the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the four others are not. <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> is the only member of the committee to openly oppose <PERSON> Stello </PERSON>'s nomination, so it is not clear how other members might vote. Stello's critics contend he is poorly suited to ensure health and safety at the nuclear weapons plants, but <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials contend his broad experience in commercial nuclear power regulation makes him a good choice. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the deputy energy secretary, said the senators' letter was `` not news'' to him because the five already had informed the department of their opposition to Stello He said he knew of `` one or two'' other <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opponents but added, `` we think the votes are there'' to gain full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval this month. Stello has been working as a special assistant to Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> since July. The weapons complex, including 17 major plants and laboratories in 12 states, is beset by mechanical, safety, environmental and management problems that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has said must be corrected soon to assure the nation's nuclear defense. Stello had been chief of staff at the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> since 1986, ranking directly under the five commission members. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> regulates commercial nuclear power. In a move interpreted by some as a sign that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> may doubt <PERSON> Stello </PERSON>'s chances of winning <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation in the current session of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> late last month told one of his top aides to temporarily take charge of the weapons office.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who only six months ago looked unassailable, is suddenly looking vulnerable and defensive. An economic slump, culminating in the Oct. 26 resignation of her treasury chief, has confronted her with possibly the worst crisis of her decade in office. The combative determination that wrought a revolution is looking more like authoritarianism _ a trait she may have exercised once too often in forcing the resignation of Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. And for the first time, she has given Britons a glimpse of a future without her all-embracing presence, saying she is likely to step down sometime after the next election, which must be held by mid-1992. `` I think people would think it was time for someone else to carry the torch,'' she told the Sunday Correspondent newspaper. At 64, midway through a third five-year term, her comment should n't have been all that surprising. The fact that it triggered a furor is testimony to the profound impact she has had on British life. Her supporters insist that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will triumph, that she thrives on adversity as she showed in waging war for the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, facing down <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s militants and, most recently, at last month's <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> conference resisting a united front seeking tougher sanctions for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` In a country where every other politician seems to change postures every opinion-poll time, <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> _ irritating as she frequently is _ does not do that,'' wrote <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> MacRae </PERSON> in The Sunday Times. Says Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>: `` A leader must lead firmly ... How can I change <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>? I am what I am.'' But her admission of political mortality is likely to intensify the war of succession that began to stir last month at her Conservative Party's annual convention. Contenders such as former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON> and Deputy Prime Minister Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> were already sending out veiled challenges. With inflation above 7 percent, interest rates at an eight-year high of 15 percent and the trade deficit hitting new records, the gloss had gone off the Thatcherite boom and the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was averaging a 10-point lead in opinion polls. Then came <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s bombshell, depriving Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of the man she herself had credited with turning <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s economic fortunes around. Thus her interview, published Nov. 5, became something of a starter's pistol in the race to succeed her. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said he resigned because Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> ignored his ultimatum to sack Sir <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, her part-time economic adviser, whom <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> accused of undermining his policies. His resignation forced a shuffle in which the three senior ministries changed hands. In the view of many commentators, it gave the 22-member Cabinet more power over Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, if only because she ca n't afford to lose another senior minister. `` ... The world has changed for her. Changed utterly ... the fear has gone out of those formerly timid men who surrounded her Cabinet table,'' commented the pro-Thatcher <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. At the heart of the crisis are two issues: Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s personal style and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s place in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ the political issue set to dominate the British political agenda in the 1990s The style issue is an old one: Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> as the nanny-prime minister, convinced she alone is right; Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> the hectoring bully; Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> the crusading free-marketeer, whose hatred of socialism leads her to savage everything from organized labor to the cherished <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>; Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> the handbagger, a term drawn from the popular caricature of an Iron Lady who slaps down critics with her handbag. The <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> dispute was, on the face of it, about whether <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> should join the currency-stabilizing exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, which links nine of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s currencies <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, who had already been trying to steady the economy by tying the pound to the powerful West German mark, wanted to join as soon as possible. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, under pressure, has agreed in principle to join under strict conditions. But she sounds unenthusiastic and <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> called the European Monetary System a `` half-baked'' idea. Many observers believe her attitude is symptomatic of an island nation's `` persistently ambiguous attitude toward European integration,'' as commentator <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauthner </PERSON> put it in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s foreign policy has swum along on her warm relationship with former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, allowing her to project <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as a world power. But President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seems more interested in the Continent than its islands, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is far better placed than <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to meet the economic challenge of a transformed Soviet bloc. Meanwhile, the Thatcher Euro-bashing of the 1980s, caricatured as the Britain-vs. - foreigners approach, has given way to worries Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will miss the boat and end up marginalized in both <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> ` Two years ago she was arguably the most respected statesperson in the world,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobbs </PERSON>, a former senior <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official. `` Yet in just a few months her simply unrestrained enjoyment of a good punch-up has left her virtually friendless on the diplomatic scene.'' A Harris poll for the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> in October showed 62 percent disapproval of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s attitude toward <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies. `` The poison is at the heart of this government in that its leader is unable to command the support of the best men in Conservative politics,'' commented <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> biographer and columnist in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s liberal Guardian newspaper. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has shaken the government before. In 1986, a battle was waged in the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> over whether to sell an ailing British helicopter company to an American company or a European consortium. <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON>, who favored the European option, lost out and resigned. He is now Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s likeliest successor. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is heading toward greater unity, bringing the corporate, mildly socialist doctrines prevalent on the Continent into growing confrontation with the robust individualism espoused by the Thatcherites. So for British politics, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> looks like a drama that will run and run.

<HEAD>DeConcini Warns About Buying More Radar Planes Until Problems Solved</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appropriations panel is warning the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> not to sign a contract for a third sophisticated radar plane until electronics problems are resolved in two existing aircraft that detect drug-smuggling flights. `` I'm very interested, being the chairman of the funding committee, in not letting a new contract when we do n't have one that works,'' Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said Monday, demanding corrections in the computerized electronics in the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> P-3 airborne early warning aircraft. The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Democrat, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and General Government, is urging that the problems be fixed by March, a month before the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to sign a contract with <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for its third flying radar platform. `` They have to tell us it will be corrected by March. If they do n't fix it, I'm going to come down on them hard,'' <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said. `` If they do n't adhere to the suggestion I'll have a hearing and it wo n't be pleasant.'' <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> documents _ and sources _ show that the aircraft have experienced trouble pinpointing the location of targets and following their course and speed; faulty on-board communications for the crew; and problems with a spinning, metal radar dome. Most documents were written by crewmen at the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surveillance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where the agency has based the P-3 <ORGANIZATION> AEW </ORGANIZATION>'s, the frontline equipment in detection of airborne drug smugglers. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected committee Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., to ask the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to investigate problems with the P-3 AEW <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendig </PERSON>, acting director of the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> surveillance center, has acknowledged there are a `` few glitches'' in the computer systems, but said the aircraft `` works and it works great.'' He said the two planes now flying were mainly responsible for detections leading to 36 arrests from Jan. 1 to Aug. 10, seizures of 37,000 pounds of marijuana and 8,300 pounds of cocaine as well as vessels, aircraft and vehicles. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s airborne early warning program manager, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON>, has said he hopes `` anomalous behavior'' in the tracker will be fixed by `` the first of the year.'' `` The airplane and the tracker are very capable and doing their job'' despite the discrepancies, <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> said. The first P-3 airborne early warning aircraft was delivered in June 1988 at a cost of more than $ 27 million, and the second arrived in April at a price of $ 30.6 million. The third plane will cost $ 35 million, money already appropriated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> P-3 </ORGANIZATION> is a four-engine turboprop built to detect enemy submarines, but two airframes were outfitted with the most sophisticated electronics available and sold to the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to detect airborne drug smugglers. The major electronics problem documented in <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> memos _ and in interviews with agency sources _ is the computerized tracker. The equipment is designed to automatically plot the course and speed of a suspect aircraft, but is sometimes so inaccurate that the P-3 can not reliably guide interceptors to the suspected smugglers, the sources and documents said.

 A murder suspect being driven on a busy highway to a city jail Monday pulled out a gun and fired from the back seat at two detectives, killing them both, authorities said. The convict, identified as <PERSON> Stoney </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, 25, ran from the scene, according to Police Commissioner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>. Around midnight, about 10 hours later, police brought in for questioning a man believed to be <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, who was found in a home in the borough of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>. Killed were Detectives <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerzon </PERSON>, 46, of <PERSON> Merrick </PERSON>, said Sgt. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, a police spokesman. The shooting, the first to claim the lives of two city police officers in more than 11 years, occurred on the Grand Central Parkway in the borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The detectives had driven <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> from the city's <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> jail to the <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> district attorney's office earlier in the day to take a lie detector test and discuss a plea bargain, police said. He was being taken back to <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> in one of the detectives' personal cars when the shooting occurred <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said both officers carried pistols in ankle holsters, but neither had been fired. The weapon with which they were shot was not recovered, and <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said it was unclear where <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> got a gun. The seating of detectives and inmate _ them in front, him alone in back _ violated procedure, <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said. Police said it was not against police guidelines to transport prisoners in personal cars. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> was handcuffed when he was in the car, but was not when he fled, according to witnesses. A pair of cuffs was found in the front seat. Police said it appeared the car pulled over to the side of the highway before shots were fired. Both detectives appeared to have been shot once in the back of the head. Police said <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, has an extensive criminal record dating to 1984, including drug and assault charges. In 1985, he was sentenced to 364 days in jail for biting off a girlfriend's ear. He was arrested in July for allegedly strangling another girlfriend after a night of partying and drug-taking. In October, he and his mother were arrested for conspiring to murder a witness against him in the July slaying. He allegedly had his mother offer $ 2,000 to a hit man who turned out to be an undercover detective. <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said three men were arrested near the airport shortly after Monday's shooting, but each was released. An hour after the shooting the detectives' bodies, in white bags, were on grass near the parkway. The sedan they were driving was parked nearby. There were bullet holes in the windshield, and the wipers were on. Another car, its front end smashed, also sat in the road. Police Capt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the driver of the second car was not involved in the shooting. Westbound traffic on the parkway was limited to one lane. Officer <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulvey </PERSON>, the first officer on the scene, said he found `` one police officer face down on the ground and the other officer on the passenger seat shot and killed.'' At least seven witnesses were being interviewed. `` It was a pretty bloody scene,'' <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said. Asked where the officers had been shot, he said, `` There was so much blood it was hard to tell.'' The officers were members of the <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> district attorney's detective squad, <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who leaves behind a wife and a daughter, was appointed to the Police Department in 1981 and earned two police awards. <PERSON> Guerzon </PERSON>, who had a wife and two children, was appointed in 1969 and earned 13 awards, <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. Rewards totaling $ 40,000 were offered for information leading to the officers' killers: $ 10,000 from a group of city businessman called COPSHOT; $ 10,000 from the city; and $ 20,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> Detectives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents detectives. The last time two police officers were killed in the same incident was April 2, 1978. Officers <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerullo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> <PERSON> Masone </PERSON> were killed in a gunfight with two occupants of a car they stopped in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. The officers shot Monday became the fourth and fifth ones killed in the line of duty this year. Fourteen others have been wounded.

<HEAD>Economists Predict Interest Rates Will Continue Falling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In what would be good news for consumers and business borrowers, many private economists are looking for interest rates to continue falling over the next six to nine months. The analysts are looking for further rate declines as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> tries to keep a sluggish economy from toppling into a recession. But while economists are looking for future rate cuts by the central bank, they do n't expect to see any further action in that direction over the next month or so, given the fact that <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policymakers moved to ease credit conditions slightly just last week. Those comments were the prevailing view as top <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> officials gathered in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today for a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the panel of <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> board members and regional bank presidents that meets eight times a year to map monetary strategy. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <PERSON> DRI-McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, said he was looking for a variety of consumer and business borrowing rates to edge lower through next summer, reflecting sluggish growth during this period and <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> easing moves. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> predicted that the benchmark prime rate, to which one-third of all business and consumer loans is tied, will be cut from 10.5 percent to 10 percent before Thanksgiving with another cut to 9.5 percent in the first half of next year. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, predicted that the national average for fixed-rate mortgages, currently at a three-month low of 9.79 percent, would fall to around 9.5 percent in coming months with adjustable rate mortgages declining by a somewhat larger amount. `` I believe we will see additional easing on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> over the next three to nine months because the economy will keep on weakening, but I do n't think the central bank is planning to make a one-fourth percentage point cut in rates every few weeks,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. Analysts were still puzzling over the timing of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s easing move last week. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> FOMC </ORGANIZATION> reportedly held a telephone conference call Nov. 6, deciding to push a key interest rate, the federal funds rate, down from 8.75 percent to 8.5 percent. Manipulation of this rate, which is the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, is the primary lever the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> uses to control short-term interest rates. Private economists wondered why the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> decided to act last week instead of simply waiting to discuss the matter at today's regularly scheduled <ORGANIZATION> FOMC </ORGANIZATION> meeting `` There was no need for them to panic because I do n't see any sign that the economy is falling off a cliff,'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said. Some analysts wondered whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> felt pressured by the pointed comments being made by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration that if the country does go into an economic nosedive next year, it will be the fault of the central bank for keeping interest rates too high. Others suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> may have moved when it did as a way of reducing the government's cost of raising funds at several huge debt auctions held late last week after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> raised the debt ceiling. But whatever the reason, economists were generally optimistic that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s move will succeed in keeping the current record peacetime expansion, which is entering its eighth year this month, going for some time to come. Many analysts believe that growth will slow significantly from now until next summer, as the economy responds to efforts the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> made last year to clamp down on credit in an effort to battle inflationary pressures. But starting next summer, these analysts are looking for a rebound in growth in response to a series of credit easing moves the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has made beginning last May. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is trying to bring the economy from a fast-track growth path to a moderate-growth path without inducing a recession,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Diely </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is within arm's length of establishing a National Museum of the American Indian in the nation's capital, and in the process, settling some longstanding feuds. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was expected to take up a bill today to transfer a priceless collection of Indian artifacts from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Museum of the American Indian to the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, which would display them in a national museum on the Mall and a satellite facility in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the measure by voice vote Monday. A similar bill passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 3, but because of slight differences in the two bills' language, Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, planned to ask the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to approve the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version today, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Zell </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs, which <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> chairs. The measure may at long last make peace among diverse factions, first by resolving a 10-year-old dispute in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> over how to display and preserve the <ORGANIZATION> Heye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> collection of more than 1 million Indian artifacts. Second, it stipulates that the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>, where possible, return some 18,000 Indian remains to their original tribes for burial. The question of the remains had been the last obstacle to crafting a passable bill, and compromise came in September when <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> reversed the museum's long-held policy that the bones were necessary for study Indians nationwide, seeking to bury their ancestors, heralded his decision as a watershed that will influence other museums. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> called Monday's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> action `` a wonderful moment.'' `` It opens new horizons for the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> and the world,'' he said in a statement. `` We'll be working with Native American communities in ways we've never done before, and it's a model for working with other communities.''

<HEAD>GOP Advice: Don't Hedge on Abortion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Next season's Republican campaigners are being advised to take firm, early positions on the issue of abortion and run on them without hedging or compromising. Party leaders said Republicans lost votes in the off-year elections because they equivocated on abortion, not necessarily because they opposed it. In addition, they said, Democrats claimed the middle ground on the issue in defeating Republican candidates for governor of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> a week ago. `` Lesson learned,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, the Republican national chairman. `` Never let your opponent define you or control the terms of debate.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said that despite the 1989 defeats, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> prospects are good heading into next year's campaign for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and 36 governors. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, head man in the war on drugs, turned to politics to advise <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governors Monday that hedging on abortion could cost the votes and doom candidates in 1990. `` I believe that Americans have a much higher degree of tolerance for honest differences, deeply held differences, than they have for trimmers and opportunists,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Republicans should take their positions on the basis of principle. `` Once you articulate that viewpoint, do not start changing just because political winds may appear to be shifting,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. That meshed with <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s counsel. Candidates, he said, must decide what they believe about the issue, state that position clearly and refuse to equivocate, no matter the campaign pressures. `` Our party is a big tent,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. `` We can house many views on many issues. Abortion is no exception.'' The party platform of 1988 opposes abortion, but <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders said party candidates do n't need to heed it. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is not a single-issue party,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, an abortion foe. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said there are many pro-choice GOP leaders, in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and among the governors. Long term, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he doubts the issue will help or hurt either political party. Party policy, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto-enforced opposition to abortion, align the party against the abortion rights activists who demonstrated in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and elsewhere Sunday. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> challenged them to demonstrate next time against drugs and the birth of cocaine-addicted babies. `` I do n't think that the record suggests that the pro-life position is political suicide,'' he said. `` It was n't political suicide for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> when he ran. It was n't political suicide for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when he ran. ... `` We now have a situation ... where <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, stands up and says to us if you dare to run people who are pro life we will get someone else up against you and beat your brains out,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` How dare she say that.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said that `` as long as people are marching ... for rights and freedoms and protections, I would like to see a march on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to protest the birth of cocaine babies.'' He said people of all parties and persuasions could join that demonstration, suggesting it should include `` some of the folks from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and elsewhere'' who march for abortion rights. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the demonstrators claim to be concerned about the poor, so they ought to be protesting drugs. `` Whatever number of people have been hurt in back-alley abortions, it is a small number compared to the number of people who have been hurt by back-alley drug sales,'' he said. The governors were winding up their annual conference today with an education discussion featuring <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assistant for economic and domestic policy.

<HEAD>Report: Catastrophic Engine Failure Caused Jet Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> jet crashed last week because its engine suddenly failed, The Atlanta Constitution said in a report on the accident that destroyed 12 apartments and killed two people in this <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> suburb. Investigators have pinpointed which engine parts caused the sudden, catastrophic failure of the A-7E Corsair II's engine Thursday, the newspaper, quoting an unidentified source close to the investigation, reported in Tuesday editions. The source, however, declined to say exactly what went wrong. Air traffic controllers said engine and radio failure may have occurred about two minutes before the crash, the time of the tower's last contact with the pilot. They said there was no indication the plane was in trouble before it hit the apartment complex. An investigation of the crash is expected to take at least 30 days. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on Monday said it would pay the funeral expenses of the two people who were killed when the jet slammed into their apartment complex: <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> Margie </PERSON> <PERSON> Padovani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Padovani </PERSON>, 28, who was two months pregnant, died of burns Friday. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>'s body was transported to <ORGANIZATION> Meridian </ORGANIZATION>, Miss. Ms. <PERSON> Padovani </PERSON>'s body will be transported to her hometown of <LOCATION> Hempstead </LOCATION>, N.Y Her 5-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Jacquelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Padovani </PERSON>, 5, remained in critical condition at <ORGANIZATION> Grady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> with burns over about half of her body. The jet's pilot, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 37, was listed in serious condition at <LOCATION> Kennestone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Conlyn </PERSON> was the only person aboard the unarmed attack plane when it crashed. The jet was returning to the <ORGANIZATION> NAS </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Dobbins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, about two miles from the apartments and 15 miles from downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, when it went down. The crash destroyed 12 of the 76 units at the <ORGANIZATION> Pine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> apartment complex and heavily damaged another 20, said <PERSON> Kathie </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>'s director of community relations.

<HEAD>A Great Weekend, A Worrying Future for Turks in Berlin</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-East Germany, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall showered cash on Turkish merchants down the road from Checkpoint <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>, but <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s largest minority community still feels enclosed by discrimination. `` The newsstands, the vegetable shops, the electronics stores had the business of a lifetime this weekend,'' said <PERSON> Mehmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmasgunes </PERSON>, an officer at <LOCATION> Bamukbank </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s predominantly Turkish <LOCATION> Kreuzberg </LOCATION> district. It was an unexpected payoff, he said, for people who years ago moved into a rundown neighborhood where not every apartment had a toilet. Behind the Wall, however, is a potential flood of competition for the low-paid jobs once reserved for immigrants. There may be even more demand for scarce housing, an issue already turned against foreigners by right-wing extremists. On the Turkish side, there is frustration about being barred from the civil service and the legal profession, about the difficulty in becoming German citizens and the red tape that keeps families separated. `` We have begun with taking down the worst wall, the biggest wall, and we want to work with the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people to take down these other walls,'' said <PERSON> Husnu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozankli </PERSON>, chairman of the Turkish community organization in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` The Turkish people have been here 25 years, 35 years now and we consider ourselves part of this society.'' Of the 755,000 workers in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, according to government statistics, 47,000 are Turks, mostly employed in factories or low-paid service jobs. Yugoslavs, who hold 15,000 jobs, are the next largest immigrant group. These `` guest workers'' were welcomed in the 1960s, but since 1973 immigration has been restricted to spouses or children of workers already here. `` If I married a woman in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> today, she could not come for at least a year,'' <PERSON> Ozkanli </PERSON> said. `` There are so many application procedures that are just harassment.'' In local elections in January, the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> blamed immigrants for <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s ills. One poster accused Turks of taking apartments needed by Germans. The party's share of the vote, though only 7.5 percent, was a green light for bigotry. `` Careful, stinking Turkish pack! Get out of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, you pigs,'' said one note <PERSON> Ozkanli </PERSON> received after the election. `` It is better if you pack your suitcases now and finally get out of the city before it is too late. 7.5 percent _ that's just the beginning,'' said another. <PERSON> Alaaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozmert </PERSON>, a Turkish attache in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> who deals with employment and benefit issues, contended that Turkish workers have little to fear from the opening of the Wall. `` The Turkish workers living here are qualified, skilled workers, and they are ... acclimatized to the life here and to the market,'' said <PERSON> Ozmert </PERSON>. `` The refugees from the East bloc countries are not yet familiar with Western technology. They would have to be re-educated to have a chance in the job market.'' At <LOCATION> Bamukbank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Elmasgunes </PERSON> said he believed most East Berliners would be content to visit and would not settle permanently in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The merchants will be happy to see them return. Even in the more subdued, workaday atmosphere that settled over <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Monday, there was hardly room to squirm among the shoppers at Ocak Import. A clerk said at least 2,000 radio-cassette players were sold over the weekend, and the store hired a truck Monday to go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to replenish stocks. `` We did n't think people would come here, but it was like a carnival in the streets,'' said <PERSON> Mahmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Balli </PERSON> at Selcuk Photo. He held up an empty cassette tape rack to show how good business had been. <PERSON> Ozkanli </PERSON> emphasized that he shared in the jubilation that gripped the city, and he offered visitors pieces he had chipped off the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall the night before. For now, he said, `` we do n't mind stepping back a bit.'' `` Everyone has to step back,'' added <PERSON> Dundar </PERSON> <PERSON> Atalay </PERSON>, a math teacher who dropped by the office. `` Even the Germans.''

<TEXT>
 Consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> is starting a campaign against it, but Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> says he's confident the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will approve a 33 percent pay raise and ethics reform package <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, at a Monday news conference, said he was gearing up the same kind of effort that defeated a proposed 51 percent congressional pay raise earlier this year. The fact that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was offering to reform its ethics this time in exchange for increasing its $ 89,500 salary and the salaries of federal judges and top executive officials does n't mean the public should support it, he said. `` I do n't think people in this country like the idea of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> telling them that they will reform themselves only if they get a pay increase,'' <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said. `` That smells bad. `` Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are in the public service, not the profit service. If they want to make more money, they can quit and go across the street and join a corporate law firm that will pay them far more than they deserve,'' he said. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said he was contacting talk radio hosts and others to block what he said was another case of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> trying to slip one past the public, a statement <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> vehemently denied. `` As usual, Mr. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> is wrong,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. Thursday's scheduled vote `` wo n't be coming up in the dead of night, snuck through without a vote,'' he said However, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he would n't release details of the package until Wednesday, the day before the vote. While no official version has been released, the outlines of the plan are widely known. It includes a 7.7 percent pay raise labeled `` cost of living adjustment'' that would take effect Jan. 1. A year later, a 25 percent raise would be combined with a new rule banning lawmakers from accepting fees for speeches. The package also includes tighter ethics restrictions on other outside income, including gifts and free trips. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION>, a group that pushes for tighter government ethics rules, praised the proposal. It `` will help ensure that the nation's top public officials are fully compensated by the public, without supplements of private interest influence money,'' he said Monday. It appeared Monday that <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON>'s scenario was only half right _ as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seemed pleased to keep taking the speaking fees. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Monday that he did n't have the votes to pass the package in his chamber, but it was possible the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would allow the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to go its own way. There is less incentive to approve the plan in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Its rules allow members to supplement their salaries up to 40 percent with speech honoraria, compared with 30 percent in the House. In addition, senators on the average have much more personal wealth than their <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleagues. Congressional salaries were last increased in 1987, when members' pay was raised from $ 77,400.

 A New Zealander is betting that British Columbians will pay to jump off a bridge. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> wants to bring `` bungie jumping'' to western <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and thinks he's found the ideal location, the <LOCATION> Nanaimo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> gorge on <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. In the first year of bungie jumping in <LOCATION> Queenstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, about 17,000 thrillseekers paid to leap off a bridge with a thick rubber cord attached to their ankle, said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a veteran of more than 300 such jumps. `` There's been absolutely no injuries,'' he said. A bungie jumper leaps headfirst toward the water. The cord, or bungie, slows momentum after about a 45-foot freefall. The momentum is all but stopped by the time the jumper reaches the water _ but then comes the rebound. The bungie pulls the jumper back skyward at almost the same speed as the descent, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` The initial plunge is the big thrill but you pull about three Gs -LRB- gravity-force -RRB- coming back up and you get three or four good bounces,'' he said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he's working on a long-term lease of the site and hopes to start building a bridge for people to jump from early next year. He said he expects to charge around $ 70 a jump.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Budget Feud Shaping up as 1990 Campaign Theme</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 As a campaign slogan, sequestration is not going to make it. Too long, almost a tongue-twister, it is four syllables of bureaucratic jargon. Besides, as one Democrat observed, most voters probably think it is an Olympic event having something to do with horses. No such luck. What it is is the government code for automatic spending cuts, jargon masking the fact that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House have n't managed to put together a budget that fits their own deficit rules President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has delivered a simple, Republican translation that is likely to be built into the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign of 1990: `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is to blame.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has the better pulpit, but the Democrats are n't about to plead guilty. So the budget feud will become a theme of the contest for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats next year, by which time the mess may be worse than it is now. The sequester system of spending reductions has been in effect for just short of a month, triggered by budget failure. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is threatening to leave it in place, unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> devises and delivers spending cuts of about $ 14 billion. `` Sequestration is a drastic action, but neither the administration nor the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must flinch from our obligation to keep this nation's deficit moving down and ultimately to reduce the debt,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in self-appraisal of his presidency so far. But they've already flinched _ the deficit has n't been moving down. The sequester system of spending reductions is part of a process of deadlines and ceilings that are supposed to rein in deficit spending and start trimming it. The automatic cuts that now are in effect, and become more drastic if they stay, are to reduce spending by an estimated $ 16.1 billion, although the final figure may turn out to be somewhat lower. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now says that unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can slice the deficit by at least $ 14 billion in a bill that still is being negotiated, he'll veto the bill and leave the automatic cuts in place `` We are prepared to manage the government under sequester,'' he said. The president said the bill will have to produce real reductions in red ink without new taxes, without pushing off spending in a fashion that will push the deficit up in future budgets, and without gimmicks. He did n't define gimmicks, perhaps because the original administration plan for deficit reduction included savings to be realized by pushing up the date of a $ 3 billion military payroll, and dropping postal costs from the budget numbers. But there also is an advantage for the administration in keeping the current cuts _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must send <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a new federal budget, for the year beginning Oct. 1, 1990, only two months from now. With the automatic cuts in place at least into the winter months, it will be easier to produce a budget meeting next year's deficit ceiling, $ 74 billion. That also would strengthen his hand in opposing future tax increases. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he still wants to work with the Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a bipartisan budget settlement that will bring down the deficits, and that politics can wait until the fall of 1990. But budget pronouncements on both sides are taking on a political edge. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people know why this deficit is n't down,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last Tuesday `` They see, 4 to 1, that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is to blame.'' It's not a new argument. When he signed a 1981 debt ceiling bill that pushed the limit past $ 1 trillion, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the measure `` can stand as a monument to the policies of the past which brought it about, policies which as of today are reversed.'' The government has had to triple the limit since then. Last week, just before a default deadline, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed a bill increasing the debt limit to $ 3.12 trillion.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is raising the possibility that reported Soviet arms deliveries to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> may be the most contentious issue at the Soviet-American summit meeting in three weeks. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers Monday evening that the Soviet shipments to that region remain the `` biggest obstacle'' to a genuine superpower accommodation. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> bears a special responsibility because its arms and money, moving through <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, continue to support violence destruction and war,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. In previous statements, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has said he does n't challenge the Soviet claim that it has ceased direct weapons shipments to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as of this year. But he has contended that Soviet shipments to the region through third countries and deliveries by the Soviet bloc have meant that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s allies in the area continue to be well-stocked. His remarks Monday reinforced the notion that regional conflicts _ particularly in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ could produce fireworks when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> hold their summit meeting in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> starting Dec. 2. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> meeting, featuring about 25 foreign ministers, was continuing today after a hectic opening session Monday that included: _ A sharp exchange in which Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kam </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of pursuing `` fascist'' policies after <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> an `` outlaw regime'' that should be spurned by `` self-respecting democracies. _ The introduction by <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> of a resolution calling on all OAS member states to withdraw their ambassadors from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> until a democratic process is under way there The human rights commission of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> released a report Monday accusing <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> of widespread abuses. _ The admission of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, amid numerous expressions of support, as the 32nd active member of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> _ A demonstration by several dozen <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> employees outside the headquarters demanding higher pay The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> is undergoing a cash flow crisis that has resulted in numerous layoffs and declining employee morale. _ A call by Nicaraguan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> for an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> appeal to the government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> `` to cease immediately the bombing of the civilian population. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> held the leftist rebels responsible for the outbreak of fighting over the weekend, calling their attacks `` acts of terror, pure and simple.'' Shortly before foreign ministers opened their afternoon session, representatives of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government and the Nicaraguan Contras reconvened peace talks here after two days of discussions last week at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. There was no report on the meeting, but <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON>, in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said there was minimal progress at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> talks because the Contra delegates were n't interested in discussing the demobilization of their forces Central American presidents last summer called for the demobilization of the rebels by Dec. 5. Both the Contras and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration regard that deadline as essentially meaningless because the presidents specified that the demobilization had to be voluntary. <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could speed the peace process by converting the humanitarian aid being received by the rebels to demobilization aid. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has insisted that the rebels must continue to receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies until after the Feb. 25 national elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. That, the administration says, will give the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> additional incentive to hold free and fair elections.

<HEAD>HUD Lender Sues, Alleging Unfair Audits Tainted Its Reputation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A major lender in a federal housing program involved in recent investigations of mismanagement is suing the government, contending it was placed on probation because of faulty audits. `` It seems as if <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> just does n't want to deal with the fact that the audit findings are incorrect,'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Benton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. `` Apparently <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> was fishing for scapegoats.'' The company filed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> suit Monday against the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. A second suit seeks a court order to force <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to give final approval to two Benton-financed projects whose mortgages are in limbo because of the allegations against the lender. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Glavin </PERSON> said the department had no comment on <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s lawsuits. The first lawsuit alleges that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> unconstitutionally denied the <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based lender a chance to rebut the charges in an audit issued early this year by the department's inspector general. The report alleged that <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> had approved inflated mortgages on more than a dozen projects, allowing the company to collect higher fees and developers excessive subsidies because those payments are based on the mortgage amount. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said the auditors violated generally accepted auditing procedures and ignored evidence that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> had approved the rents cited in the report as being excessive. The suit alleged the auditors `` violated their duty to report accurately and fairly the findings of their own investigation.'' That suit also alleged that the department's <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> could not objectively judge <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s case because it is headed by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> assistant secretary for housing, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>, who the company said has accepted the findings of the audit. The board has been scheduled for weeks to meet today to discuss the <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> audit.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will pay more than $ 5.2 million in fines and restitution after pleading guilty to two felony charges of illegally obtaining secret <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget documents. Before accepting the plea worked out between the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge T.S. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> grilled lawyers for nearly an hour Monday about whether `` the penalty is appropriate to what I consider to be a serious violation of the law.'' The company pleaded guilty to felony counts of unauthorized conveyance of government documents. The charge carries a maximum fine of $ 10,000. An individual convicted of the crime could be sentenced up to 10 years in prison. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> repeatedly questioned whether individual <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employees or officials were guilty of criminal wrongdoing and if the company had taken proper steps to ensure it would not continue to receive <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> documents it was not supposed to see. `` For a group of people in a company to know that it has these documents and takes no action is fairly arresting,'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Study: Decaf Coffee Raises Cholesterol Levels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People who switch to decaffeinated coffee to avoid the jitters may be unknowingly raising their cholesterol levels and even heightening their risk of heart disease, a study suggests. Researchers have long suspected but never proven that caffeine, the chemical that gives coffee its jolt, was somehow involved in heart trouble. The study raises the possibility that coffee without caffeine could be the real villain. The research, conducted at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, found that people who went from regular coffee to decaf increased their levels of low-density lipoprotein _ the so-called bad cholesterol _ an average of 7 percent `` It's not like going out and eating cheesecake, but the overall impact could be great,'' considering the popularity of decaffeinated coffee, said Dr. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Superko </PERSON>, who directed the research. <PERSON> Superko </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lipid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, presented his findings Monday at the annual scientific meeting of the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He said he doubts that the process of taking out caffeine changes the coffee so that it raises cholesterol. Instead, he said the difference may result from the kinds of beans that go into various types of coffee. In general, he said, mild arabica beans are used to make regular coffee, while most decaffeinated brands use more strongly flavored robusta beans. <PERSON> Superko </PERSON> calculated that the average 7 percent increase in bad cholesterol in his subjects could translate into about a 12 percent jump in the risk of heart disease. `` Does coffee cause heart disease?'' he asked. `` I do n't know. We can only say that coffee causes cholesterol changes.'' No single study can prove that something is harmful, and the <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION> findings will have to be duplicated by other researchers before doctors are certain they are true. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> officials were interested in <PERSON> Superko </PERSON>'s findings but unwilling to comment in detail without seeing the full report. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Boecklin </PERSON>, president of the New York-based association, said: `` Coffee and cholesterol have been investigated in many studies with conflicting results. We agree with researchers that it is too soon to make any definite choices.'' One of those who questioned the latest findings was Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennekens </PERSON>, head of a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> study of aspirin's role in preventing heart attacks. He speculated that some other habit of decaf drinkers, rather than their morning brew, may be responsible for the higher cholesterol. `` One has to question whether it's something else that coffee is a marker for, rather than coffee itself,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> study used 188 healthy, middle-age coffee drinkers. At the start, the volunteers drank three to six cups a day of ordinary brewed coffee for two months. Then their cholesterol levels were checked, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups _ more regular coffee, brewed decaffeinated or no coffee. Cholesterol levels remained steady in those who stayed on caffeinated coffee or gave up coffee entirely. But bad cholesterol levels rose nine milligrams per deciliter, or 7 percent, in the decaf drinkers. <PERSON> Superko </PERSON> cautioned that the study does n't entirely exonerate ordinary coffee, because it could contribute to heart disease in other ways, such as by triggering rhythm abnormalities or spasms in heart arteries. `` I'm not saying everyone should stop drinking decaf,'' he said, but if people are worried, they might experiment on themselves by having their cholesterol levels checked. In other findings at the meeting: _ Researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said they monitored the hearts of people with coronary artery disease while they slept and found getting out of bed in the middle of the night seemed to lead to potentially harmful periods of ischemia _ a temporary shortage of blood _ Researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> found that for active, physically fit people with heart disease, shoveling snow probably is n't any riskier than other moderate exercise They cautioned that people with heart trouble should not shovel unless they have taken a treadmill test and consulted their doctor.

<HEAD>Ruins Reveal Early Emergence of Mayan Civilization</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A jungle-shrouded city of pyramids and temples in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> was built as long ago as 630 B.C., showing that Mayan civilization blossomed about four centuries earlier than believed, scientists say. The findings may make the ancient city of Nakbe in northern <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> one of the oldest in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, researchers said. `` It's a very significant discovery,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Demarest </PERSON>, anthropology chairman at <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, on Monday announced the findings by archaeologist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> and colleagues at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlos </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have substantial evidence that this is the earliest <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> urban center ever found,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> BYU </ORGANIZATION> anthropology chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON> added, `` We're now going to have to push the beginning of <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> civilization back further into the past.'' Archaeologists once believed advanced Mayan civilization emerged around A.D. 300 and ended 600 years later during what is described as the `` classic period.'' Research conducted during 1978-83 at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mirador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, pushed that date back to 200 B.C. But in excavating Nakbe, 350 miles north of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and not far from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mirador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s 50-member team determined that roughly 100 stone pyramids and other buildings were from about 630 B.C. to 400 B.C. So were some of the site's 65,000 pottery pieces, sculptures, figurines and other artifacts. Dates can be determined by the radioactivity of carbon in organic material associated with buildings. Pottery is dated by comparison with the style of shards from elsewhere in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We have from 1000 B.C. to 600 B.C. a small village with wooden buildings,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said by telephone from his home in <LOCATION> Rupert </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` Then all of a sudden _ boom! They brought in rock and fill and buried the village and made platforms. On those they placed their buildings.'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nakbe </PERSON>'s buildings include 35 - to 150-foot-tall platforms and flat-topped pyramids, many of which are topped by three small temples and sculpture depicting important gods and kings The buildings are solid, without interior rooms. The scale of construction reflects the emergence of an administrative and religious elite to command thousands of workers, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. Anthropologist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, said an even earlier center of advanced Mayan civilization may be found. Still, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> Nabke </ORGANIZATION> study `` is part of the most exciting Maya discovery of recent decades.'' The discovery solves a puzzle for archaeologists: The Mayans seemed to evolve more slowly from farming communities to cities than other pre-Columbian civilizations to the north and south. But archaeologists say Nakbe proves that Mayan development occurred more or less in step with the rise of the Olmec culture in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, thought to be the oldest civilization of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>. An archaeologist mapped some of Nakbe's architecture in 1962. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> first visited in 1987 and his team conducted the first full-scale excavation last February through April. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s team hacked their way through dense jungle for three days and 40 miles to reach Nakbe from the nearest road. They hauled water from a swamp 4 miles away. <PERSON> Demarest </PERSON> admiringly called it `` macho archaeology.'' Among the most important finds at Nakbe is a sculpture on a limestone slab that probably dates from about 400 B.C. and is about 10 feet tall, 4 feet wide and 18 inches thick. The sculpture of two royal figures and a god `` is the earliest and largest preclassic sculpture ever found,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. Other discoveries include seashells and obsidian glass tools that indicate emergence of long-distance trade. There also are signs of a society taming its environment: gutter-like water collection systems on six buildings and 60-foot-wide stone-and-mud roads, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. He said he believes transformation from village to city happened because trade and the need for water and transportation fostered emergence of an administrative and religious elite, which then ordered construction of temples.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>' `` Die <PERSON> Frau </PERSON> <PERSON> ohne </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatten </PERSON>'' was one of the Metropolitan Opera's first productions after it moved to <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. It still is one of its most magical and beautiful. The Met performed `` Die Frau'' on Monday night for the first time since the 1981-82 season. <PERSON> Mechthild </PERSON> <PERSON> Gessendorf </PERSON> was to have sung the Empress but was replaced in the title role by soprano <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcon </PERSON> because of illness. For Miss Falcon, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, the performance was her Met debut. The part contains very high notes, which Miss Falcon can reach. However, her vocal production was inconsistent. When she was good, she sounded very good but that was n't all the time. The evening's star was <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Zschau </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Die <PERSON> Frau </PERSON> <PERSON> ohne </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatten </PERSON>'' _ the woman without a shadow _ is about an empress who can not bear children. She lived in a spirit world before she married the Emperor. In that world, she and her nurse meet the <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> and his wife. They're looking for an `` ordinary'' woman to relinquish her shadow so the Empress can take it The <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>'s wife toys with ideas of glittery clothes and a young man _ both are conjured up by the nurse _ that might be more fun than motherhood. Miss <PERSON> Zschau </PERSON>, who performed the <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>'s wife, was fairly flamboyant in acting and singing. Her voice pours out, radiantly beautiful, large and exciting. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schunk </PERSON>'s tenor was less than subtle as the Emperor. Conductor <PERSON> Christof </PERSON> <PERSON> Perick </PERSON> seemed to increase volume every time <PERSON> Schunk </PERSON> sang and the tempo of <PERSON> Schunk </PERSON>'s first aria was so slow he seemed to have trouble. Baritone <PERSON> Bernd </PERSON> <PERSON> Weikl </PERSON> fared better as the Dyer, sounding serious and solid but warm. <PERSON> Helga </PERSON> <PERSON> Dernesch </PERSON> as the Nurse was having pitch problems. <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> oversaw the production _ which uses a shiny dark green forest for the royal and spirit scenes. A gazebo is as delicate as a fairytale. The stage machinery is used for scene changes. Projections merge into new ones; sets go up or down, bringing a new scene to stage level as the old disappears, and the turntable revolves. This is an opera that ends happily. Librettist <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofmannsthal </PERSON> presents fulfilled family life, with both couples embracing, both women possessing shadows.

 The dollar ended higher against the Japanese yen Tuesday, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> made up for morning losses and broke a record high set the previous day. The dollar finished unchanged from its opening at 143.80 yen, up 0.25 yen from Monday's close of 143.55 yen. The currency ranged between 143.60 yen and 143.85 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 18.52 points, or 0.05 percent, ending the day at 35,768.64, yet another high. The index had reached a record Monday at 35,750.12, with a 86.92-point gain. Dealers said the index recovered when institutional investors bought steel issues, expecting no immediate trend changes in foreign exchange and interest rates. In currency dealings, the dollar-yen rate was moving narrowly, as market players were reluctant to make major moves ahead of a series of releases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic indicators later this week, as well as the auction for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government bonds, said a foreign exchange analyst with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

 Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> toured the earthquake-shattered <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district, and praised <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciscans </LOCATION> for the way they reacted to the disaster. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' 40-minute walking tour took him past buildings that were knocked from their foundations or burned in the Oct. 17 quake, which measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, killed 66 people and did an estimated $ 7 billion in damage. `` I am extremely impressed with the way this was handled,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. The secretary said several ambassadors had told him they admired the way local officials and the public reacted to the disaster. `` There was no panic and a minimum of looting,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. `` There was positive control and people listened to those in authority.'' The tour covered about eight blocks of the largely residential <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district, which was built on landfill dumped in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> to form the foundation for the 1915 <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exposition </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said power has been restored to most of 5,000 homes in the 100-block area.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The fierce fighting raging in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> shows both sides of the rebels' double-edged sword. Neither is honed for battlefield victory. The rebel <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> is pursuing a two-track strategy aimed at dramatic changes in one of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>'s poorest and most polarized countries. With an estimated 7,000 regular fighters and perhaps twice as many irregulars, the leftist rebels know they can not defeat a 45,000-man armed force backed by massive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. Instead, they hope to bring about broad social and political change by either making the country so chaotic that the status quo crumbles or by pressuring the new rightist government into concessions. In the eyes of rebel theoreticians, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> could become ungovernable if a broad-based civilian movement _ encouraged by the organizational efforts of the rebels or political activists who share some of their goals _ meshes with the armed rebel struggle. `` This insurrection is n't conceived of as a general uprising in which the masses will rise up throughout the country at the same time,'' rebel commander <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabral </PERSON> said recently. `` We have a more irregular, much less classic concept.'' They see pressure from inside and outside <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> as the key to forcing the government to meet their negotiating terms. `` The military struggle is a means of backing up demands,'' rebel commander <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, last week. Whether the spectacular and bloody offensive they launched Saturday night will move them any closer to their goals remained to be seen. But the rebels clearly put the war back in the spotlight. `` The only good thing that could result from this would be to wake people up, to bring about negotiations,'' said <PERSON> Lutheran </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Medardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, a member of a nationwide coalition seeking peace talks. `` Otherwise we are lost.'' Both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Salvadoran officials insist the offensive is an attempt to disguise declining rebel military fortunes. `` I think this is a sign of weakness rather than strength,'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told reporters late Monday. He said the offensive would not reverse what he called the `` fading'' fortunes and legitimacy of the rebel front. But <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> also called it part of an attempt by the front to `` enhance its appearance of strength at the bargaining table.'' The guerrillas stunned the nation by bringing their fight to the capital as they had never done in 10 years of largely rural, hit-and-run combat. After nearly 24 hours of heavy combat, the rebels had entrenched themselves in neighborhoods along a wide arc on the northern fringe of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. They installed themselves in homes and apartments and positioned snipers in church towers and tall buildings. In many areas civilians, both willing and unwilling, were obliged to provide support. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said an estimated 1,500 guerrillas were taking part in the fighting in the capital. The attacks in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> were accompanied by at least 50 other coordinated actions nationwide, he said. Civilian casualties appeared high as government helicopter gunships strafed heavily populated areas where the rebels were dug in. Some feared the offensive would move the government away, not toward, negotiations by strengthening the hand of the ultra-rightists in President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> who have long been accused of links to death squads. `` This will be a test for the government because it has facist tendencies,'' <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said as gunfire crackled outside his modest church in the city center. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> imposed a state of seige after the fighting broke out, suspending constitutional rights such as freedom of assembly, and his government imposed a virtual news blackout. The president also warned that political parties `` that might be part of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>'' would not be tolerated. Recently initiated peace talks between the rebels and the government broke down after the Oct. 31 bombing of the headquarters of a union sympathetic to the rebel cause in which 10 people were killed and 29 were injured. The rebels, who named the offensive after one of the slain union leaders, clearly hoped public indignation over the bombing combined with the shock of the fierce combat in the capital would help revive the peace process. The two sides are far apart and each accuses the other of lacking any real interest in peace. The rebels say <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s demand that the fighting stop before any serious talk on reform begins is like an invitation to suicide. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> says rebel demands for a purge of the military high command and for replacing the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> are `` totally absurd.'' `` We realize that the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> is a reality, that it exists,'' he said recently. `` But it is a small reality ...''

<TEXT>
 At night the crack-infested inner-city neighborhood where a motorist was shot to death in front of her 4-year-old son is full of suburban `` commuters'' who cruise in to buy drugs, then motor home. Neighbors of the north <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> neighborhood call it `` Drug City,'' and describe a life in which gunfire is common and drug dealers so brazen they can grant or withhold permission for a person to enter his own apartment building. Residents see the fancy cars arrive from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> suburbs, drawn by the streetside trade in cocaine, heroin and other drugs in a neighborhood of boarded-up buildings and crumbling sidewalks. A mural that reads `` Push Crack Back'' is just wishful thinking, they say. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierro </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Weehawken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and her son arrived in the neighborhood in a rented car shortly before dawn Sunday, police said. A man approached the car and fired one shot into the rear, striking Mrs. <PERSON> Pierro </PERSON> in the back. She drove about a block before striking a light pole, said Officer <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Pierro </PERSON> died at <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Her son was unharmed. Police later arrested <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, 32, and charged him with second-degree murder and criminal possession of a deadly weapon. Mrs. <PERSON> Pierro </PERSON> lived with her husband, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, their son and 8-month-old daughter in a two-story house. <PERSON> Pierro </PERSON>, a furniture store manager, said he did n't know why his wife was in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. `` She was a typical middle-class housewife,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who lives near the family. `` She dressed very conservatively and loved her kids. She was helpful to neighbors. ... Once she helped jump my car battery. I ca n't believe the slaying.'' The motive appeared to be robbery, police said Monday, but added that it was unclear if Mrs. <PERSON> Pierro </PERSON> had been in the area to buy drugs or had accidentally wandered into streets overrun by drug dealers. Either way, the shooting has drawn attention to the concern by law enforcement officials and others about suburban drug buyers. Statistics from the city's <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION> document the suburban drug trade: Of 3,000 cars seized from accused drug buyers between 1986 and November, 1,600 were from outside the city, 600 from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> alone. `` We see some really terrific cars,'' said Inspector <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> of the narcotics team. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said suburbanites who shop for drugs in the inner city `` are contributing significantly to the drug problem in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` We still see people coming in from the suburbs into heavy drug areas to purchase drugs and take them out to the nice suburbs,'' <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said. `` They are doing business with people prone to violence. Occasionally, they get them upset.'' In a June drug raid 10 blocks from the scene of Sunday's killing, police confiscated 42 cars, including 25 from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and 13 from other <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> suburbs Suburban residents have been caught up in the violence before. In April, 32-year-old <PERSON> Lidia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was shot and killed by police officers after she led them on a chase through <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> streets. Police said they pursued her after she ran a red light while high on heroin, cocaine and other drugs. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> authorities are well aware of the problem. Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holl </PERSON> said his <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> office in July began identifying motorists buying drugs across the <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and arresting them when they returned to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` Crack is cheaper over there than it is here,'' <PERSON> Holl </PERSON> said. A <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> resident who lives near where the <LOCATION> Pierro </LOCATION> slaying occurred said she hoped it would draw attention to her block and help save it. `` I hate that the poor woman got killed but I hope they can do something about it. Please come help us out here in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION>. We need it,'' the woman said. She asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal from drug dealers.

<TEXT>
 The Galileo spacecraft, speeding toward a 1995 rendezvous with Jupiter, successfully completed its first course correction by firing its small thrusters more than 2,000 times, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. The three-day maneuver, which ended Saturday night, accelerated the spacecraft by about 38 mph, bringing its speed to more than 60,000 mph relative to the sun, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The trajectory change is meant to put <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> in proper position for its flight past <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> on Feb. 9, 1990. The spacecraft will swoop by <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> once and <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> twice so the planets can act as `` gravity slingshots'' to propel <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> toward Jupiter during the $ 1.9 billion mission. In July 1995, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> will separate into an orbiter and a probe. The orbiter will circle Jupiter for 22 months starting Dec. 7, 1995, and the probe will parachute into the Jovian atmosphere, making measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed by intense pressure. <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18.

 The former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> admitted he cheated millions of consumers by selling them sugar water labeled as pure apple juice for babies. <PERSON> Niels </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON>, 56, pleaded guilty Monday to 10 felony counts of violating the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The plea forestalled a third trial for Hoyvald. `` I did not intend to defraud, but I do plead guilty with intent to mislead the public,'' <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> said. `` I did it knowingly.'' `` We're glad this defendant has finally admitted his involvement,'' said the prosecutor, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>. Beech-Nut and its corporate parent spent as much as $ 10 million in legal fees during the case, said federal Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> fined <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> $ 100,000 and sentenced him to five years probation and six consecutive months of full-time community service. The agreement concludes a complex and costly prosecution that began three years ago. <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> was convicted in February 1988 on about 350 counts of willfully violating the food and drug act, but a federal appeals panel overturned the conviction on a technicality. A second trial in September ended with a mistrial. <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON>, who has since been fired by <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION>, was president of the company during part of the period that the baby-food giant produced and distributed as pure apple juice for babies what was actually water flavored with beet sugar or other sweeteners and containing little, if any, apple. `` This case has probably cost <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>, the corporate parent of Beech-Nut, in fines and legal fees, many times the few millions they saved in passing off this bogus apple juice to the public,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the Eastern District of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In November 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty to 215 felony counts and paid a $ 2 million fine, plus investigation costs. Another defendant, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> vice president during the years the company willfully cheated millions of its customers, was also convicted in the scheme. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last month ended <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON>'s right to appeal and obligated him to serve a year-and-a-day jail sentence.

<TEXT>
 The military wants more land for war games in four Western states, but hunters, ranchers and environmentalists see its plans as a land grab twice the size of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> that menaces wildlife and farming. Four separate proposals by different branches of the armed services would expand areas for training with tanks, warplanes and artillery by 16,800 square miles in unconnected areas in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. The Pentagon says the proposals to add military training to uses allowed on the federally owned land are n't part of a coordinated effort. But environmentalists say <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejected a similar national program in 1974. `` It's too coincidental to be a coincidence,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, regional executive for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> wants to use 1,500 square miles in northeastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s rolling plains for training by its own units and forces of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. About three-fourths of the acreage is federally owned grazing land. In southern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has proposed expanding the 155-square-mile <LOCATION> Saylor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> Bombing Range to more than 2,300 square miles. The plan has stirred opposition from ranchers with cattle grazing the land, environmentalists fearing damage to wildlife, and some local politicians. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> wants to create a $ 3 billion `` electronic battlefield'' that will be used to test aircraft and weapons under simulated combat conditions. The machinery would be scattered across a 20-mile-wide, 70-mile-long section of the state's western desert. In western <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> wants a 1,100 square mile training area near <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fallon </LOCATION>. The base also has proposed adding 10,000 square miles of the airspace used for flight training, more than doubling the area now used. That would restrict uses of the land beneath the flight paths. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> also wants to set aside 310 square miles in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> as a missile firing range, plus 280 square miles as buffer zones for the naval air station's bombing ranges. Despite the suspicions of environmentalists, the simultaneous proposals in four states are coincidental, said Maj. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, public affairs officer for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> at the Pentagon. `` I have not been aware of anything that would tie this to those other issues,'' he said. He said the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> proposal was tailored to the <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s needs as it converts to F-16 fighter planes, newer tanks and updated Cobra helicopter gunships. The <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has undergone a similar shift to different aircraft and equipment, he added. The military needs more sites for its maneuvers in sparsely settled areas of the West because many of the nation's existing bases are getting hemmed in as cities and suburbs spread, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. The plans are raising eyebrows in all four states _ where the military already controls a combined 5,300 square miles. Ranchers say they're worried about the effect on federal grazing land, which is leased to cattlemen. Farmers say they're worried about water rights. Hunters question the effect of military training on wildlife. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, a six-weekend trial run on a small section did little to reassure ranchers who use the land to graze cattle. `` I do n't know how the hell we're going to get something to grow back in that,'' rancher <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyquist </PERSON> said, looking at tank tracks torn through the thin soil. `` I do n't think any of the federal or state agencies, even the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> itself, really knows what the cumulative impacts of this program may be,'' said <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> of the Wildlife Federation. The military has tried to offer assurances. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, the Guard said it wants to be just one of many users of federal land, in compliance with the federal doctrine of `` multiple use'' of the federal estate. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials offered assurances that grazing and hunting on the land would continue, diluting opposition from ranchers and residents of small nearby communities. Debate over the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> proposals centers on a wilderness bill in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that its sponsor has agreed to amend so it wo n't endanger the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s plans. Environmentalists have complained that the changes gut the legislation. Citizen Alert, an environmental group based in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, claims many of the proposed bombing and gunnery ranges are part of a regional `` continental operation range'' conceived by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, but rejected by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1974.

<HEAD>City Agrees On $50,000 Settlement With Black Men In `Stalker' Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The city agreed to pay a total of $ 50,000 to more than 330 black men who were stopped, frisked, questioned or arrested last winter during a police hunt for a rapist. The settlement came in a federal lawsuit that claimed the investigation was conducted in an unconstitutional manner from February to March 23, 1988, when police arrested <PERSON> Reynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, later convicted of 10 attacks against women. After weeks of negotiations, the agreement was reached between the city solicitor's office and <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, legal director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudovsky </PERSON>, representing some of the plaintiffs. The city admitted no liability in the case. The agreement marks the third time since 1986 that the city has reached settlements in class-action lawsuits alleging constitutional violations in investigations by city police. The settlement was the second in the case. Shortly after the suit was filed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court in March 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agreed to stop detaining black men merely because they resembled a police sketch. In the settlement, which includes $ 20,000 payment for legal fees, 63 men will receive a minimum of $ 500 each, while 273 others will receive at least $ 100 each, <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, known as the `` Center City Stalker,'' was convicted last year of 10 robberies, three attempted rapes and seven indecent assaults in a series of crimes that terrorized women living or working downtown. The stalker haunted hallways and stairwells in buildings within a six-block radius of City Hall. Sometimes using ruses, sometimes by force, he would get the young wonmen he victimized into out-of-the-way locations and then rob them and sexually assault them. In November 1986, the city agreed to pay nearly $ 500,000 to be divided among 1,444 people who were stopped or searched by police during a drug crackdown in 1985. In February 1986, a $ 45,000 settlement was reached by the city and residents of a neighborhood who were rounded up and questioned after the shooting death of a police officer.

<HEAD>Liechtenstein Monarch Dead at 83</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VADUZ, Liechtenstein (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prince <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION>, head of state of the tiny principality during a half century that saw it become one of the world's richest nations, has died at age 83, the government said today. He was the world's longest-reigning monarch when he died late Monday after a long, undisclosed illness and less than a month after his wife, Princess <PERSON> Gina </PERSON>, died at age 67. The prince's poor condition had prevented him from attending her funeral. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> was the 12th ruler of the 270-year-old nation, last remnant of the `` Holy Roman Empire''. The principality covers 61 square miles of rolling land and rugged mountains between <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. His 51 years as head of state spanned the rise of this tiny democratic state from an underdeveloped and rural country to a sophisticated industrialized nation with one of the world's highest per-capita incomes. He enjoyed great popularity among the 28,000 inhabitants, often mixing with them in the streets of <LOCATION> Vaduz </LOCATION>, the capital. `` I am ruling over a happy country,'' the prince, defined by the constitution as `` hallowed and sacrosanct'', once said in a rare interview. `` It is a happy country because it is small.'' In 1984 he handed over his executive powers to his son, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>, the oldest of their five children. But he retained the ceremonial role of head of state, and continued to meet many well-wishers every year during the festivities marking his birthday on Aug. 16, a public holiday. The constitution gave him the right to veto any piece of legislation. But throughout his reign he used the veto only once, to kill a law on hunting rights. `` It was a silly law. it would have turned every garden into a shooting ground,'' he explained. Born in 1906 at <LOCATION> Frauenthal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, he took office in 1938, succeeding his uncle, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Franz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> took over a country that was so poor that the government once tried in vain to mortgage the government-cum-prison building. His father had once sold part of the family jewels to bail the government out. The young prince, a nephew of Austrian Archduke <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> whose assassination in <LOCATION> Sarajevo </LOCATION> triggered World War I, faced his first challenge in 1938 after <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> became part of the Nazi Reich. He made history when he used his powers to force the formation of a national coalition government after the `` anschluss,'' and paid an official visit to <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> in March 1939. The visit helped make the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> `` leave us alone because it flattered <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s ego,'' he reminisced in an interview. He added that the Fuhrer, who was `` visibly ill at ease ... did not make any impression at all,'' on him during the 90 minutes of small talk in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Reich Chancellory. Like neighboring <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION> stayed neutral during World War II. After the war, <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> led the country in resisting Soviet demands to extradite some 500 Russians, including <PERSON> Grand </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Cyrillovich </PERSON>, heir to the throne of All the Russias, who had sought shelter in <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION>. British historian <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevor-Roper </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION> thus was the only country which refused to join in what he called one of the `` great betrayals.'' <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> spoke of a `` proud chapter'' in his country's history. He lost extensive property in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> when it was nationalized after the Communist takeover of the country. But the family's art collection of 1,400 <PERSON> Rubens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyck </PERSON> and other old master paintings with a current estimated value of $ 150 million was saved by being moved from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION> in 1944. Despite his personal wealth, <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> stuck to a simple lifestyle that helped keep his name out of the gossip columns of the international press. He was a devout Roman Catholic who started every day by attending mass in the chapel at his 13th century castle perched 360 feet above <LOCATION> Vaduz </LOCATION>. While opposing any liberalization of the country's abortion laws, he was an outspoken champion of women's rights and began pressing for female suffrage in the 1950s. This was grudgingly accepted by <LOCATION> Liechtenstein </LOCATION>'s men in a 1984 referendum. He was a keen sportsman who served for more than 35 years on the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and even late in life enjoyed downhill skiing each winter.

 A federal judge set May 15 for the third trial of former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, accused of selling documents to a Soviet agent. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was arrested in 1984 on espionage charges and remained in custody until his release on bond last month. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Takasugi </PERSON>, who set the trial date Monday, took over the case from <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>, who withdrew after overseeing the first two trials.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it had reached a tentative accord with two unions to end the last of the strikes that began in August against regional telephone companies around the country. The company said Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to end the walkout that disrupted installation, repair and directory assistance services to 10.5 million customers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. However, <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> insisted his union's leaders had yet to approve the deal, which hinged on settlement of a dispute over health care costs The <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> negotiating committee was scheduled to resume considering the accord today, he said. `` How the company wants to paint it is their business. We think the statement was premature,'' <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said. The tentative three-year pact would raise wages 3 percent in the first year and 1.5 percent in each succeeding year, said <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>. It was the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON>, who first let slip in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, speech Monday that the two sides had resolved the contentious issue of health insurance. The primary dispute was over <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> efforts to shift some costs presently borne by the company onto workers. `` We have saved our health care,'' <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> told an <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> convention. `` There are no premiums.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said the talks progressed quickly after phone company officials agreed to continue paying all health benefits. `` We look at it as a total victory,'' <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> said. About 60,000 workers in the two unions have been on strike for 100 days at <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telephone </LOCATION>, which serve <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> represents 40,000 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> workers and <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> has 20,000 workers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The bitter dispute, in which one striker died after being struck by a car on a picket line and the company reported numerous incidents of vandalism, began Aug. 6. At that time, 200,000 workers struck four regional `` Baby Bell'' companies in 20 states, including <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION> in the West and <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> in the West. The other walkouts ended within weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> was said to have more to lose because its systems are in aging Eastern cities where operating costs are higher. The company said the tentative pact was reached after it agreed to pay all workers' health benefits and the unions agreed to give up a bonus and profit-sharing plan that would have given them an annual bonus of 1 percent of their annual pay. <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> called the tentative accord `` a realistic solution to a very difficult set of issues facing not only our company but the entire nation.'' <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> blamed the strike for a 14.8 percent decline in third-quarter profits.

 A man arrested in the 1960 death of his former girlfriend plans to plead guilty, hoping the judge will realize he has changed in the interim and that `` not a day has gone by'' in which he has n't been torn by remorse. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 64, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> told reporters upon arrival at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Monday that he hopes the judge will show him mercy. `` It was an accident. We were tussling over the gun and it went off,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` It happened and I'm sorry about it,'' he said. `` Not a day has gone by since then that I did n't think about what happened.'' `` But I have changed. My outlook has changed,'' he said. `` I know about the things that mean something to a human being, the real things in life _ like <PERSON> God </PERSON>, a family and treating your fellow human being right, doing the best you can.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> is accused of killing <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Redmon </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> in September 1960. He moved to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where he has lived and raised as a family as <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told authorities he took the name <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> intentionally. `` She always meant a lot to me; we were together for 12 years,'' he said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was jailed in the <ORGANIZATION> Lew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sterrett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> today in lieu of $ 100,000 bail on a murder charge. Prosecutors asked for the high bond because of <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s history `` He's shown he's pretty good at disappearing,'' said <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinne </PERSON>, first assistant district attorney. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputies were searching through some old arrest warrants when they found the one for <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. A check of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> fingerprint files showed that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had the same prints as <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kinne </PERSON> had said earlier he might have <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> indicted under the habitual criminal law, a move that would make a life sentence possible. `` We still have n't decided for certain,'' <PERSON> Kinne </PERSON> said. `` But we probably wo n't re-indict him. He has n't been in too much trouble for the last 28 years.'' While living in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> married, worked 17 years at a steel mill and raised five children. He has three grandchildren and worked with others on his block to fight drug dealers. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said that no one, including his wife, knew about his past until he was arrested earlier this month by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. `` I thought about turning myself in two or three times, but then I thought about the pain it would cause my family. So for that reason I did n't,'' he said. `` I just had to live with this.'' `` I always did figure they would catch me,'' he said. `` I was n't running I lived in just one place. To tell you the truth, I'm glad it's over.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who has not hired a lawyer and did not fight extradition to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, says he wants to plead guilty and take the consequences. He then would like to return to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` That's who I am now,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> is a different person. I want to block that out of my mind completely when this is over with. I want to get it over with and go back to being <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.''

 In another <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> mishap, two military planes strayed outside a target range and bombed public land, slightly injuring a camper and forcing others to dive for cover. Camper <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hacienda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> was hurt when struck on the chest either by shrapnel or debris during the Saturday afternoon incident about two miles outside the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Chocolate Mountains Bombing Range. `` I'll tell you,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said, `` it was the most frightening experience I've ever had.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blachley </PERSON>, chief ranger of the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> office, said he was informed that campers were well within the `` killing zone'' of the bombs but may have been saved because they were behind the paths of the bombs rather than in front of them. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the incident. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, citing unidentified military sources, said human error is likely to have been to blame in the bombing. No indication of mechanical or technical failure was evident, the sources told the Times. The A-6 bombers, on a routine training mission from the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Centro </LOCATION>, dropped a dozen 500-pound bombs on this remote desert area 150 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centro </ORGANIZATION> base. The area, administered by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, is 30 miles from the nearest paved road and is not a formal campground, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said. But it is frequented by campers and off-road enthusiasts. `` It was unreal.

<HEAD>South Koreans Watch Fall of Berlin Wall, Hoping For End of Own Divisions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s punching of holes in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall has stirred hope that the barbed wire and fortifications dividing the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> will eventually disappear. Awed and stunned South Koreans have watched television footage of portions of the Wall being torn down and East Germans streaming freely to the West. Newspapers and television stations have given exhaustive coverage of the demise of the Wall along with a flood of editorials and articles asking if the same thing could happen in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. But few observers believe there is any chance of a quick end to the bitter confrontation between capitalist South Korean and the communist north. Nor, say observers, is there much chance of any swift opening of the Korean border. `` The <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> as a whole falls ever farther behind as the rest of the world moves on to a new post-Cold War mentality,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Poitras </PERSON>, a noted expert on <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> affairs. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung-chul </PERSON>, a political analyst, said the Demilitarized Zone dividing the two <LOCATION> Koreas </LOCATION> is now `` the last remaining Cold War emblem'' and is not likely to disappear soon. Most North Koreans probably have not even been told about the fall of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall or other reforms in East bloc countries, observers said. Even as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and their <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies and satellites move to reduce tension and scale back military forces, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> are locked in a major military build up. Both Koreas are spending billions of dollars to expand and strengthen their armed forces. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, with a population of about 22 million people, is estimated to have the world's fifth largest army with 1.25 million men. The Korean peninsula is the site of one of the world's greatest military concentrations with 1.5 million heavily-armed troops on both sides facing each other along the 100-mile <ORGANIZATION> DMZ </ORGANIZATION>, where border clashes are common. The north was implicated in the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner, which claimed the lives of 115 people aboard, and other recent terrorist attacks. The two sides technically remain at war since no peace treaty was signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953 after the north invaded the south. The border is sealed tight with virtually no contact and both sides claiming to be the one legitimate government of all <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` The Koreans fought a war and the Germans did not. There's a lot of suspicion that still exists,'' said <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fullerton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> analyst. Some 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> leaders say the American forces are vital to prevent another Korean War despite some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Congressional calls for a reduction to save money. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> remains a rigid totalitarian regime under the God-like rule of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, who has dominated the country with a vast personality cult since the late 1940s. The 77-year-old <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> has designated his son, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, as his political heir in what would be world's first Communist dynasty. While the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other Communist nations have undergone reform in recent years, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has made no attempt to move away from its oppressive political system even though its economy has virtually collapsed. Most South Korean and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observers say there is virtually no chance of political change in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> remains in control. They say his son appears determined to continue the system. For <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to emulate Soviet-style reform, some observers say, would have been like <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> ordering the dismantling of the Iron Curtain in 1950. Alarmed by the wave of liberalization in other Communist nations, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, who rarely leaves his country, visited <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> earlier this month to consult with Chinese leaders on opposing changes in the Communist world. Many South Koreans hope the changes in Communist nations eventually will have an impact on even <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and that there will be a reduction in tension that could one day end the division of the peninsula. `` The force of an avalanche is too strong to resist forever,'' said The <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> in a Nov. 12 editorial.

 An exclusive country club concerned with keeping its image off the chests of thousands stopped designer <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> from selling shirts emblazoned with a design similar to the club's crest. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> signed a settlement Friday ordering <ORGANIZATION> Ralph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lauren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to stop selling the shirts with the disputed design, though he exempted those already at retailers. <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> must pay <ORGANIZATION> Pine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> $ 100,000 in legal fees and an additional $ 250,000 as part of the settlement, which did not assign any wrongdoing. Club president <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, who called the suit a `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> and Goliath'' conflict, said money was not the issue in the lawsuit. `` We were protecting the image of the club,'' <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> said. `` We felt it had been a mark that represented us and our heritage and prestige in the community.'' The country club was established in 1927 and has a membership of 250. It prides itself on maintaining a Scottish flavor, with employees dressed in Scottish kilts on its golf course serving homemade clam chowder cooked in iron pots over open fires. Pine Lakes sued <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> more than a year ago, charging the club's 1971 trademark was violated. The Pine Lakes crest is used on golf shirts, hats and blazers and is used in promoting the club. The 3-year-old <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> logo has a crown above a circle within a circle. In the center of the smaller circle are the letters `` RL.'' The design has been used on thousands of shirts. It is one of three labels that adorn shirts by Polo. The top-selling shirt features a polo player on a pony and was not involved in the suit. Pine Lakes' suit said the RL logo was `` confusingly and deceptively similar'' to the club's crest. Polo disagreed, saying there was no trademark infringement. <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> called the result a compromise. She said the company had planned to stop selling shirts with the disputed logo, but could not offer a reason.

 Sudden reforms in the Eastern bloc have historians scrambling to replace old assumptions that are being eradicated as quickly as sections of the Berlin Wall. History books already need updating to reflect last week's stunning events in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and academics and their students watch as each day's headlines make the previous day's reading assignment obsolete `` The rules are changing by the hour,'' Professor <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Saivetz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Russian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. `` No one is writing and no one is willing to commit themselves because once you write a book it's out of date.'' The East German government shocked the world, including many of those who study the region's politics, with its announcement last week that citizens were free to travel to the West. Suddenly the 28-year-old Berlin Wall, that ultimate Cold War symbol, was being dismantled. The old Iron Curtain mentality that permeates today's books on modern European history _ already undercut by the thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations and other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc reforms _ suffered a staggering blow. `` We're all sort of grappling with what to do next and how to approach this area of the world that we've been teaching about for years given the fast-paced changes that are going on,'' said <PERSON> Saivetz </PERSON>, who also teaches political science at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gere </PERSON>, a historian at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, said his lesson plans were jolted this semester by the events in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` Talk about changing the class curriculum,'' <PERSON> Gere </PERSON> said. `` We were going to talk in the coming weeks about whether the wall would ever come down. My God, we never had a chance to get to it.'' The changes sweeping the region will affect cultural, political and economic relationships with the West, academics said. `` It was almost inevitable that all these East European communist regimes would explode one way or another,'' said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulam </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s Russian Research Center. `` But this has been spectacular.'' `` Different events have piled one on top of another with a suddenness no one anticipated,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>. He said, however, change in the Eastern bloc was inevitable given domestic dissatisfaction and Soviet Premier <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, a professor emeritus of economic history at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` It's too soon to know what eventually will happen with such a free-floating situation.'' But he predicted the Eastern bloc countries would now be a factor in 1992, when Western European nations plan to drop their trade barriers. `` It's conceivable that all those countries would float into a common European market,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> suggested. <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitter </PERSON>, director of the Center for <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said that recent events would be interpreted not just as a major step toward German re-unification but also as part of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s unification. `` As of six months ago, the only thing my students were talking about was 1992,'' <PERSON> Schmitter </PERSON> said, referring to the trade agreement. `` Now all of a sudden we have have to think about a whole new set of combinations.''

<TEXT>
 An anti-busing school initiative narrowly passed after absentee ballots were counted, but the school board head said he was unsure whether the measure would be enacted. The `` Save Our Schools'' initiative that went before the voters last Tuesday received 71,046 votes in favor, or 50.4 percent, to 69,911 against, or 49.6 percent, elections officials said Monday after counting the ballots. Initiative 34 asks the school board to ban the busing of students for racial balance; it does not require a ban. It says that if the board agreed to stop busing, 6 percent of the city's sales tax revenues _ about $ 4.5 million _ would be awarded to the school district for improving school programs in an effort to achieve integration voluntarily `` I might call for the school board to vote on the initiative Wednesday,'' <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> T.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassar </PERSON> said. `` But maybe it might be better to allow the courts to rule it unconstitutional.'' <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, head of the pro-initiative forces, said supporters will lobby the board to accept the measure. `` What we've been able to do by getting the initiative passed is give the school board another tool to deal with busing,'' she said. If the board votes to accept the initiative, a lawsuit would be filed against the school district by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Monday.

<HEAD>Amnesty International Sees Increasing Rights Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said in a report today that human rights have suffered a `` dramatic deterioration'' in parts of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the last 1 -LCB- years, singling out <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The international human rights group accused security forces in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> of 2,500 political killings and blamed authorities in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> for the disappearances, torture, or execution of hundreds. It appealed to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, whose foreign ministers were meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, to demonstrate the political will to help eradicate `` abhorrent'' human rights violations by government forces and paramilitary groups linked to them. In its catalogue of allegations, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> reported that since 1988: _ More than 2,500 civilians in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> have been unlawfully killed for political reasons by the army and paramilitary forces working for them, and more than 300 people have disappeared. _ Hundreds of Peruvians have disappeared, been tortured or killed by government forces. _ In <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, hundreds of victims reportedly disappeared or were illegally executed by members of the security forces operating in uniform or clandestinely in the guise of death squads. _ In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, now mired in some of the worst fighting of its decade-old civil war, there was `` persuasive evidence'' that police and military personnel carried out abductions, disappearances and politically motivated killings attributed to death squads. Amnesty said it has also received reports this year of illegal executions or disappearances in other countries in the region, including <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. It said several countries continued to use the death penalty, which it considers cruel and unusual punishment. The group noted that so far this year, 14 prisoners have been executed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the death row population grew by July to an unprecedented 2,210 inmates, including 28 juveniles. Amnesty said torture is widespread in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and was routinely reported in countries where counterinsurgency policies resulted in patterns of grave human rights violations, including <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Amnesty said it was also concerned about torture reports from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. It said political prisoners were being detained in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Amnesty said it welcomed the decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> to draft an Inter-American Convention of Forced Disappearance of Persons. It said such a document should prohibit secret detention; require that detainees be held only in recognized places of detention; and call for readily accessible, up-to-date registers of detained people. Amnesty also said it was important that governments should not take pre-trial measures to exonerate those accused in disappearances. It expressed concern about the 1988 presidential pardon of Argentine military officers charged with human rights violations. It said the move effectively obstructed further investigation into the disappearance of thousands of people under military governments in the 1970s and early 1980s.

<HEAD>Shamir's Bloc Makes Advances in Union Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc scored substantial gains in nationwide trade union elections billed as a referendum on <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s stance on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace, returns showed today. However, the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also claimed victory in Monday's voting, saying it had cut <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s momentum from recent victories at the polls. Results released by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio today showed that with more than 90 percent of the vote counted, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 27.5 percent, an increase over its current 22 percent. Labor, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s partner in the coalition government, garnered more than 55 percent support, just slightly more than its present standing. The remaining votes went to three smaller left-wing parties. The elections were for leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Histadrut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, a traditional Labor stronghold. The 1.5 million-member organization helps determine <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> labor policies and owns a major chunk of the nation's farms and industries. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> leaders claimed the electoral showing was a boost to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as he headed to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for talks with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday about efforts to start Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. `` I can only say <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> has increased its strength in the Histadrut by about 25 percent. This is a significant increase under difficult conditions, in a game it is not used to playing in,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on the radio before boarding an airplane for his 11-day <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trip. `` I think it is a serious achievement,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> added. `` I can explain the addition to our strength on the basis of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s political achievements. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had called the elections a national referendum on his stance for talks with Palestinians which include an adamant refusal to include the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in negotiations or trade territory for peace. Labor favors a more conciliatory approach, including withdrawing from parts of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in exchange for peace. Labor saw the results as a victory because it stopped a worrisome electoral losing streak to <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. The right-wing bloc has won national and local elections in the past year. Analysts also noted that <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> fell short of its goal of attaining one third representation on the <ORGANIZATION> Histadrut </ORGANIZATION>'s governing council, which would have meant blocking exclusive Labor control. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader and Vice Premier <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, interviewed after television projections Monday night, claimed his party had emerged victorious. `` This shows the public has given renewed confidence to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and we will reach new heights,'' he said. In the elections, about 1.5 million Israelis chose delegates to the 1,501-member <ORGANIZATION> Histadrut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, which selects the organization's governing board. Voter turnout was more than 50 percent, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media reported. The Histadrut, which is Hebrew for `` union,'' was founded in 1920. It in effect helps formulate national employment policies by negotiating nationally binding wage and pension agreements with the government.

 The state will seek the death penalty for a couple accused of killing three men they employed on their northwestern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> farm. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, 75, and his 68-year-old wife <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> were charged Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Livingston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courthouse </ORGANIZATION> with three counts of first-degree murder. County Prosecutor <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> announced the decision to seek the death penalty at a news conference before the <ORGANIZATION> Copelands </ORGANIZATION> were arraigned in separate proceedings. Asked why the state would seek an execution of an elderly couple, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said: `` It is n't the death penalty because of the age. It's the death penalty because of the alleged offenses here.'' The decision to seek capital punishment in the case was based on allegations that the victims were killed for money and to cover up another crime, he said. The Copelands' public defenders accused <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> of mounting `` a media event or even a media circus.'' `` We both feel strongly that <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>'s rights are being severely compromised by the daily flood of baseless innuendo, particularly in light of their frail health,'' said attorneys <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Schenkenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> represents Mrs. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, and Ms. <PERSON> Schenkenberg </PERSON> represents <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>. The victims were killed with gunshots to the head and buried on farms where <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> had done odd jobs for several years. Police have said the men were transients who <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> hired to buy cattle with bad checks. The Copelands were not charged Monday for the death of a fourth, unidentified man whose body was found in another barn more than a week after the Oct. 16 discoveries of the first three bodies. Prosecutors were reviewing evidence in the fourth case. Sheriff <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON> said a search for nine more former <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> employees would continue in the county. About 100 sites already have been searched, he said. The Copelands were charged Oct. 9 with conspiracy to steal cattle with bad checks from an account set up in August for an employee. The conspiracy charge was dismissed Monday. At the arraignment, bond was set at $ 500,000 for each. A joint preliminary hearing was scheduled Nov. 29. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> was emotionless and silent; his wife sobbed throughout her separate proceeding and tried to make a statement before being dissuaded by <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, her attorney. The victims were <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Dardanelle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jimmie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Netherton </PERSON>, filed a wrongful death suit Monday alleging the <ORGANIZATION> Copelands </ORGANIZATION> `` knowingly, willfully and wrongfully'' shot and killed her son. `` I feel very sad because it's all so senseless,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Netherton </PERSON> said. `` He was a nice guy. He would n't have hurt anybody.'' The suit seeks damages, but does not specify them. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s mother, said she found no solace in the state's decision to seek the death penalty. `` There could n't be justice,'' she said. `` They could never replace my boy.''

 A powerful explosion ripped through the national headquarters of the election commission today, five days before a controversial referendum on Moslem autonomy. Police said one person was killed. Police said the 7:05 p.m. blast damaged the left side of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Elections building, destroying four rooms. The blast also damaged windows in the nearby <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Roman Catholic cathedral. A parttime maintenance man was killed, police said. Officials said several employees were working overtime in the building at the time of the explosion. There were no arrests and no one claimed responsibility. But police said two passersby were taken into custody for questioning. Commission officials had requested additional security at the building because of reports that Moslems planned a demonstration there Wednesday to protest the upcoming referendum on regional autonomy for <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> and other southern islands. On Sunday, voters in 13 southern provinces and nine cities will decide whether to join an autonomous regional government aimed at satisfying demands for self-rule by the estimated 4 million Filipino Moslems and ending a nearly 20-year-old Islamic revolt. But critics and supporters of the autonomy plan, approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and signed by President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in August, fear it may fall short of its goals and anger both Christians and Moslems. The <ORGANIZATION> Moro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the main Moslem rebel organization, has opposed the autonomy plan as inadequate. In <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, Front leader <PERSON> Nur </PERSON> <PERSON> Misuari </PERSON> claimed President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government was setting the stage for a `` genocidal war'' against Filipino Moslems. The Front has been waging a nearly 20-year insurgency to establish a separate state in <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> and other southern islands. A cease-fire with the government has been in effect since Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> met <PERSON> Misuari </PERSON> in 1986 on the island province of <LOCATION> Sulu </LOCATION>. Before the Moslem rebellion peaked in the mid-1970s, an estimated 50,000 people were killed and thousands more fled for the nearby <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> state of <LOCATION> Sabah </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A state appeals court turned aside defense objections and allowed a second black to remain on the jury for today's start of the manslaughter trial of a policeman in the shooting of a black motorcyclist. The court Monday upheld the decision of Circuit Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON>, who maintained the defense opted to exclude the juror illegally on the basis of race. <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> seated the juror Friday even though defense attorneys have a right, known as peremptory challenge, to exclude jurors without showing cause. The appeals court said there was no need to dissolve the six-member jury and start the painstaking selection process all over again. `` Obviously I'm happy that we're able to proceed,'' said prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>. `` We think it's a fair jury.'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said the session would begin this afternoon, although opening arguments may not start until Wednesday because of pretrial motions and problems with sequestering a jury. The ruling came after three weeks of jury selection in the case of officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, who is charged in the slaying of the motorcyclist and the death of his passenger in an ensuing crash Jan. 16. The incident set off three days of riots. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, accepted one black juror and strenuously denied that race was behind his trying to exclude the second black juror, <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said he wanted <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> excluded because, as a union representative, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> defended workers fired for alleged drug abuse. The defense intends to emphasize the victims' drug use to support its contention that <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, in self-defense because the motorcyclist was trying to run him over. With <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, the jury consists of two blacks, one Hispanic and three non-Hispanic whites. The issue of race has hung over the case since the shooting. Three times in the 1980s, the killing of black men by white officers or the officers' acquittals on similar charges have sparked rioting in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area.

<HEAD>Entire Lithuanian Politburo Summoned to Moscow</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The ruling Politburo has summoned the entire Communist leadership of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> to a meeting that likely will press Kremlin efforts to rein in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>'s drive for sovereignty, legislators said today. The Politburo of the Baltic republic's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will travel to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Wednesday, but there was no immediate detail on what would be discussed. The Politburo normally meets on Thursdays. Lithuanian sources said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> may want to discuss calls for the republic's party to declare itself independent from the national party, a series of laws that the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> declared unconstitutional on Friday, or to head off an attempt to follow Baltic neighbor <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> in annulling the 1940 decision to join the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskykh </PERSON>, asked about the report at a news briefing, said he had no information but that it was not unusual for a republic's entire party leadership to attend a Politburo session. <PERSON> Eduardas </PERSON> <PERSON> Vilkas </PERSON>, a deputy of the Supreme Soviet parliament, said he thought the topic would be proposals that the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> party declare itself independent from the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. That topic is to be discussed at a congress of the Lithuanian party scheduled for Dec. 19. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has criticized suggestions that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the republics spin off into independent organizations. <PERSON> Kazimieras </PERSON> <PERSON> Motieka </PERSON>, a second deputy, said the topic might be a declaration by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet parliament canceling several decisions at the heart of the drive by republics for more political, cultural and economic autonomy. The Presidium declared that laws passed by <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> as well as <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in the southern <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region giving them the right to veto national laws, violate the Soviet Constitution. Lithuanian law that restricts republic citizenship to those who lived there when the law was passed earlier this year, have a permanent job or means of subsistence also violate the constitution, it declared. It also found that laws adopted by the three Baltic states that make Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian the official language in the respective republics violate the rights of some people to hold a wide range of jobs. The Presidium urged the republics to rewrite their laws.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A lawyer accused of misconduct for his role in the <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case failed to appear before a disciplinary panel and risks suspension. <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> had been ordered to appear Monday before the grievance committee. But he said it was unethical and unconstitutional for the committee to force him to disclose information he had obtained as Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s lawyer. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> claimed she was abducted and raped by six white men in 1987. A grand jury concluded last fall after a seven-month investigation that the black teen-ager had made up the story. On advice from <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>, attorney <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> did not cooperate with police or grand jury investigations. <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> claimed authorities were engaged in a racist cover-up. Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, the special prosecutor in the case, filed a complaint charging that <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> knowingly made false statements, helped the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> family in illegal conduct, told them to leave the state to evade the law, and obstructed justice. Charges also were filed against <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> by a prosecutor implicated in the attack by <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> without substantiation. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>, chief counsel to the committee, said lawyers `` have an obligation to cooperate with investigators, and an attorney who does not cooperate is guilty of professional misconduct, whether or not the underlying allegations are proven.'' The committee, an agency of the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, can apply to the court to have a lawyer suspended for failing to cooperate, he said. <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> said he expected the committee would begin suspension proceedings against him. Serious allegations of misconduct can result in disbarment.

 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> laid a wreath at the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp today after assuring Polish lawmakers that a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would not threaten Polish security. Later, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and Solidarity Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> signed a declaration that opens the way for greater economic and political cooperation and repeats West German commitments to respect <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s western border. The 78-point document aims to `` heal the wounds of the past through understanding and reconciliation.'' Leaders expressed hope for a new chapter in relations between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, led by the first non-Communist government in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. At <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> laid the flowers at the `` wall of death,'' where the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> had prisoners of different nationalities shot, and another in <LOCATION> Birkenau </LOCATION> where crematoriums incinerated the bodies of millions of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s victims. He did not speak. Polish television broadcast part of the visit live to the nation to somber music of <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was accompanied by <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>; and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s only rabbi, <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Joskowicz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. At least 2.5 million Jews were among the victims at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Birkenau </LOCATION>. A small group of people held up banners outside the camp saying `` Victims of the war demand compensation,'' and `` All of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is responsible for the crime of genocide and the plunder of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was not the first West German leader to visit <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>; Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> visited the camp in 1977. But <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s five-day trip, which ends today, comes at a time of tremendous upheaval in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and less than a week after East German's Communist leaders punched holes in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and let their people travel freely to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The rapid pace of change in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where lawmakers on Monday endorsed opposition calls for free elections, has prompted serious discussion about prospects for a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The idea worries many Poles and West German officials have sought during <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s visit to allay fears that a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would threaten Polish security. They have told their Polish hosts that such a <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would respect a 1970 treaty that pledges <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> to respect the <PERSON> Oder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neisse </PERSON> rivers as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s western border. Some West German conservatives have suggested that reunification be sought within 1937 borders, which encompass about one-third of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Speaking Monday to Polish lawmakers, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> stressed that a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would not be a threat to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> because it would be part of a new European order based on cooperation and respect for freedom. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s remarks were reported by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Marshal <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>, a Solidarity adviser. <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told the lawmakers that `` In general, he thinks that the process of reunification would be a process connected with the general process of unification of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and the 21st century would not be a time of national states.'' <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON> said he was `` satisfied'' with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s appearance.

 Authorities today investigated the procedural lapses that resulted in the slaying of two detectives by a prisoner riding alone in the back in their car with a gun stolen from a police locker, police said. The inmate, <PERSON> Stoney </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, 25, was recaptured at his girlfriend's house shortly before midnight Monday, 10 hours after the shootings, said Sgt. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrensen </PERSON>. Detectives <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 34, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerzon </PERSON>, 46, were slain near <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> while driving <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> back to the <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> prison. The detectives had driven <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> to a prosecutor's office to take a lie detector test and discuss a plea bargain. Police believe <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> stole a gun from a detective squad locker in the district attorney's office, where he had been left unattended for a short time Monday. On the way back to <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> was seated alone in the back seat, with the two detectives in front _ a violation of police procedure, said Police Commissioner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>. Authorities said the detectives' car was pulled over to the side of the highway before the shots were fired. <PERSON> Guerzon </PERSON>, who had been driving, was shot twice in the head; <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was shot twice in the back and once in the head. Witnesses said they saw <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> drag the driver out of the car and into the roadway. He then got back in the car but ran off after failing to start the engine. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> was handcuffed when the detectives put him into the car, but witnesses said he had somehow managed to remove the cuffs. A pair of handcuffs was found in the front seat. Police said <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> has an extensive criminal record dating back to 1984, including drug and assault charges. In 1985, he was sentenced to a year in jail for biting off a girlfriend's ear. He was charged in July with strangling another girlfriend, and in October, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> and his mother were arrested on charges of conspiring to murder a witness against him in the July murder. He allegedly had his mother offer $ 2,000 to a hit man who turned out to be an undercover detective. The last time two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> police officers were killed in the same incident was in April 1978, when two officers were slain in a gunfight with occupants of a car they stopped.

 The new premier today began talks aimed at forming a government to end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war, but a defiant general warned Christian leaders about cooperating with Moslem politicians. `` Those who take part in the -LRB- <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' Cabinet better stay in <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> land,'' Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, leader of Christian forces, was quoted as saying by the independent newspaper An-Nahar. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, 54, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, controls most of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Four <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> deputies held a meeting in the northern <LOCATION> Batroun </LOCATION> province, outside the area of control of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 troops, to decide whether to take part in the new government. The four included Phalangist leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, the main <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> negotiator in 23 days of parliamentary deliberations at <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, last month which produced a peace pact to end the civil war. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has rejected the Taif accord because it failed to include a clear timetable for the withdrawal of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Fearing <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s wrath, most Christian legislators who participated in the Taif talks have not returned to the Christian enclave. Parliament deputies met at an airbase in Syrian-policed north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Nov. 4 to ratify the Taif accord and elect <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> president. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, 64, also a Maronite, named <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> on Monday to form a National Reconciliation government representing all the warring factions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with the objective of ending the civil strife. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s election and declared opposition to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' government, which he said `` will be an unconstitutional government. `` It will not be a national reconciliation government. It will represent one side,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said. `` Even if the whole world recognizes it, <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' Cabinet will be a government operating in the shadow of Syrian occupation. `` Governments can not survive only on foreign recognition. Peoples topple governments,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> warned. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said his `` war of liberation'' against the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> was `` continuing, through political and diplomatic means. `` I will stand fast until <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> explodes from within,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said in an interview published today that opponents of change could sabotage reform efforts in East bloc countries by exploiting the disgruntled masses. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have been at the forefront of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc reform, but the rapid changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the recent leadership change in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> have left only <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> still resisting political reform. Even <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> today, however, substantially loosened travel restrictions on its citizens. In an interview with the government daily <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries `` who want to carry out reform have attained genuine majority.'' The changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> reinforced Hungarian reforms, he said, but he cautioned against being `` overly optimistic,'' saying `` there are still too many dangers lurking in wait.'' `` I consider -LRB- the -RRB- economy in every <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Treaty member state to be in a critical state, which is a serious source of danger,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said, noting that economic reforms would take years to have an effect. `` Disappointed and resigned people who are in a state of apathy and can not directly feel the effects of political changes on their own living conditions can be easily exploited by the political circles that want to slow down or halt transformation,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. `` This is the gravest danger,'' he added.

 A group that fought a guerrilla war with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> finished first in elections that will lead <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to independence, but failed to win enough voes to claim total power, unofficial results showed today. Thousands of people who were pleased that the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> at least won a majority thronged the streets of the capital and adjoining townships today, waving flags, singing and honking horns. `` We are very happy. We struggled all the years for this day,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, president of the black nationalist group. With figures in from all 23 districts, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> won 331,597 votes, about 57 percent of 577,974 unchallenged votes cast Its main rival, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, won 165,230 votes, or about 28 percent. The remaining votes were split between eight smaller parties. Authorities were reviewing 96,281 ballots to determine their validity. But even if <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> won all the questioned votes, it would fall short of its target of a two-thirds majority. At stake in the election, conducted last week under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision, were 72 seats in an assembly that will write a constitution and declare independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> sometime next year after 74 years of South African rule. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s leaders had predicted their leftist movement, which took up arms against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1966, would easily win the two-thirds majority that would have enabled it to write the constitution without consulting other parties. Instead, it will need to bargain with its rivals, notably the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a multi-racial coalition that served in the South African-installed transitional government and favors a capitalist economy. The unofficial results were disclosed by election officials prior to the final certification by the head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring force, <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>. Only after the official figures are announced will the exact breakdown of assembly seats be known. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> had trailed the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> throughout the counting process, which began Monday morning, and only overtook its rival with the tallying of votes from the last of the 23 districts _ the heavily populated northern region of Ovambo, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s stronghold. There, according to the unofficial returns, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> polled 197,100 votes to 9,200 for the alliance, leapfrogging into the lead. In addition to the two frontrunners, only two of the other parties appeared assured of winning seats in the assembly. These were the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, not related to the South African anti-apartheid group of the same name, and the all-white <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION>. About 6 percent of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s 1.3 million people are white. After the polls closed Saturday, <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> formally declared the five-day election `` free and fair'' in terms of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> requirements. He said the 95 percent turnout of registered voters `` has given the whole world an exemplary lesson in democracy.'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> officials on Monday agreed that the elections were free but said they still had questions about the fairness. They said some of the ballot boxes that arrived in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> did not have the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> seal on them as required. Territorial election officials denied any such irregularities. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> captured the territory from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in World War I and ruled it under a League of Nations mandate subsequently rescinded by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> refused <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> orders to withdraw from the territory until an agreement was signed in December which also provided for Cuban troops to leave neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.

 State troopers stormed a southern <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> prison today and ended a siege by inmates, killing eight prisoners and freeing 39 hostages, police said. Fifty troopers rushed into the <LOCATION> Curitiba </LOCATION> prison with guns blazing after prisoners killed one hostage and injured three others, said Sgt. <PERSON> Ericu </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassou </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Curitiba </LOCATION> is 525 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. He also said 13 inmates were injured during the battle. `` We were forced to invade because there were no grounds to negotiate, and they were threatening the hostages,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. He said the prisoners, who were armed with pistols, knives and iron clubs, had demanded machine guns and an armored car for a getaway. The siege began Monday when eight prisoners who worked in the prison kitchen seized 40 employees, including the director, vice director and several psychologists, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. About 20 other prisoners joined the revolt after the hostages were taken, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. He said negotiations were conducted until early this morning, when police invaded. The prison director, <PERSON> Aldamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Martins </PERSON> <PERSON> Filho </PERSON>, was one of those injured.

 The vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> today urged <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> industrialized nations to increase their aid to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries to hasten moves toward democracy. `` It's clear that what's happening in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will have enormous impact on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, on <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> relations and on the rest of the world,'' said <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> as trade talks ended here. <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> told reporters that Western nations should `` try to support as much as we possibly can, economic and political development in those countries.'' He cited <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has invited his 11 <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> partners to dinner in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Saturday to discuss the rush of events in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and how the West should respond. <PERSON> Andriesson </PERSON>, who is responsible for coordinating Western economic aid to the region, said Monday he hoped to visit <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> before the end of the year to `` get support for the tendency to democracy'' in that country. He played down speculation on granting European Community membership to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which has just opened its borders to the West, but he said the trading bloc would probably adopt a favorable `` low-key, commercial agreement'' with the country. In a brief meeting today with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s minister of international trade, <PERSON> Hikaru </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, he said urgent action was needed to help relieve the economic crisis in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nico </PERSON> <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> _ the umbrella organizaton of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> _ hoped to gain support of other Western nations for a $ 210 million `` food supply action'' in early 1990 to supplement a current food aid project. `` We as the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> consider our role as both a coordinating one and a stimulating one. We would like to inspire all partners to contribute,'' <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> food aid program is supplying cereal, meat, fruit and olive oil to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which faces a severe food shortage. Revenues from sales of the food are put into a fund for long-term improvement of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s ailing agricultural industry, <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON>, who is responsible for coordinating <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> aid to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, was in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to attend trade talks between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> linked to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> was pleased that <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> wanted to discuss <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but neither side discussed specific aid proposals. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is reportedly considering an aid package worth more than $ 100 million for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but officials have refused comment. In addition to the food supply program, the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> also plans a $ 210 million economic package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> that involves investment promotion, environmental action, market access and worker training, <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON> said.

 Anti-apartheid protesters cheered <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to stop investing in companies that do business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` It was inevitable that the trustees divest. All credit should be given to students, faculty and community members who have applied pressure for the past 20 years,'' said <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abouali </PERSON>, a senior who protested <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>'s investments. The <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> school announced Monday it will sell by the end of the year its $ 11.5 million in investments in companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The undergraduate faculty council voted unanimously in 1988 to call on trustees to divest completely within a year. However, the decision came unexpectedly at a weekend trustees' meeting at which divestment was not on the agenda. <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> read the decision at a faculty meeting to cheers from the 250 to 300 students present. The trustees said in a statement that the investments have `` great symbolic meaning'' and the continuing dispute over them `` undermine <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to achieve some of its educational goals.'' The board noted that <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>'s investments in companies doing business with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have declined from 15 percent, or $ 63 million, of its endowment in 1985 to less than 2 percent this year. The college already had accepted prohibitions against investments in South African firms, financial institutions making loans to the South African government, companies supplying goods and services involved in the enforcement of apartheid and firms doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that did n't adhere to certain employment policies. In 1985, students built shanties on campus to protest apartheid. In 1986, 12 students attacked the shanties with sledgehammers. A confrontation over moving the shanties off campus resulted in 18 arrests.

<TEXT>
 Negotiators from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> deadlocked today on whether catastrophic medical coverage for retirees should be scaled back sharply or repealed outright. House conferees insisted on repeal of the year-old program, just as the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had done. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators, seeing no movement from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, responded by insisting that the provision of the law covering hospital costs be retained. `` We have n't made any progress on catastrophic,'' Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators, told reporters. He assailed the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for taking a hands-off position on the issue. `` I frankly do n't see the White House exercising any leadership on catastrophic,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know where they are. I'd be delighted to find out. The administration took the same stand earlier this year when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> battled over the fate of the landmark medical insurance program. At one point, Health Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> endorsed one <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal for salvaging parts of the program only to have Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> insist that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was not speaking for the administration. If <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators are unable to agree on what to do about catastrophic, the law will remain on the books and coverage under the program will be expanded in January. However, congressional aides on both sides of the issue say a long-term stalemate is unlikely. That is because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been deluged with mail from many retirees who oppose parts of the program. The biggest sore spot is the income surtax, paid only by 40 percent of retirees, that finances most of the program. Both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted to repeal the surtax. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill would retain a flat $ 4-a-month premium that is paid by all but the poorest retirees. That premium would continue protection against high hospital bills but provide no coverage for doctor bills or prescription drugs.

<TEXT>
 Family farmers from the leading soybean-producing states sued the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> today, accusing it of illegally manipulating prices. The federal suit was filed by individual farmers and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a lobbying group that represents small farmers and rural businessmen in 34 states. At issue is last summer's collapse of soybean prices, which the farmers blame on an emergency order July 11 by the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> to sell off all large holdings in soybeans. The order was widely viewed as an effort to break up an alleged attempt to corner the market by <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanziaria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's largest soybean processors. The farm organization said in a statement that the order was a `` bad-faith and self-serving action'' initiated by the <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION>'s dominant members, including major soybean merchants, to create profits It said the resulting drop in soybean prices `` could cost the rural economy, farmers, rural bankers, implement dealers and others well over $ 1 billion.'' Board Chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> considers the lawsuit frivolous.

<HEAD>Voices of Dissent Emerge at Vatican Meeting on AIDS</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dissent emerged Tuesday at a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> conference on AIDS, with delegates complaining that no voice was given to victims of the disease themselves. After negotiations with the president of the conference, Vatican-based Archbishop <PERSON> Fiorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelini </PERSON>, about 50 delegates organized a separate meeting in a side room to discuss their own agenda for dealing with AIDS. Many alleged the conference allowed no room for debate or questions. Some expressed concern that official speakers were focusing too much on the sexual behavior and drug use that can cause AIDS. The group included <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON>, a 34-year-old AIDS victim from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` I'm quite distressed as someone with AIDS that this conference with so many important speakers does not include one person with AIDS,'' he said. `` I'm being told how and what to think, but I'm not being asked We're getting very very angry because we're ignored. The group decided to ask conference organizers to let <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> address the three-day meeting, which ends Wednesday with a speech by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. There was no immediate indication of whether the request would be accepted. <PERSON> Angelini </PERSON> referred to the criticism, telling the conference that AIDS victims were represented but their confidentiality should be respected. An Irish priest with the AIDS virus was ejected from the conference Monday when he stood up wearing a sandwich-board with the slogan `` The Church has AIDS.'' The priest, the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, heads an AIDS care center called <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lighthouse </LOCATION>. He was invited back to the conference Tuesday by <PERSON> Angelini </PERSON>. `` No voice was given to people living with AIDS,'' said <PERSON> White </PERSON>, 43, who contracted the virus while working as a missionary in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. `` It seemed to be a conference where delegates were meant to be totally passive.'' `` The Berlin Wall is coming down but new walls are coming up here,'' added <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunst </PERSON>, head of a group called `` Cure AIDS Now'' that supplies meals to AIDS patients in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` It's been the usual focus on gay bashing and abstention in sex. The real issues of care are not being addressed. It's all rubber-stamped.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Meirose </PERSON>, who heads a program for pastoral care of AIDS victims in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said, `` This is the worst conference I've ever attended There is no chance for dialogue or interaction. There is no voice for any voice.'' Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who gave the opening address Monday, agreed the conference could have been organized differently. `` I would have included people with hands-on activity, including persons with AIDS,'' he told reporters. `` I would also include periods of discussion and exchange of ideas.'' Tuesday's official speeches focused less on the high-risk behavior that can lead to AIDS and more on scientific and medical questions. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Pellegrino </PERSON>, director of the Center for the Advanced Study of Ethics at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said doctors have a `` moral obligation'' to treat AIDS patients without discrimination. Those who refuse should be suspended or have their license revoked, he said. <PERSON> Pellegrino </PERSON> said doctors also have a duty to break the rule of confidentiality and advise one spouse if the other spouse has AIDS, with or without the partner's consent. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, head of the pedriatics department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>, said all pregnant women should be tested for the AIDS virus just as they are for syphillis. <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> said most women who give birth to seropositive babies did not know beforehand that they carried the AIDS virus themselves.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> today offered massive financial aid to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> if the Communist nation revamps its centralized economy, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s mayor warned of economic problems caused by the newly opened borders. Also today, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new premier called for a coalition government but gave no indication the opposition will be part in it, despite widespread protests pressing for an end to the Communist monopoly on power. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, considered a reformer, also said the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, though open to travel, must remain standing to keep AIDS, crime and other Western problems out of his Communist country, a newspaper said today. A leader of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s biggest opposition group, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION>, said today that the movement could work with a revamped <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> but that naming <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> premier was not enough. Also today, the official East German news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported that the government was considering opening part of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall near the Brandenburg Gate as yet another passage between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The gate, a huge columned monument, is one of the city's best-known symbols. <LOCATION> Before </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> opened its borders, the gate had been a major rallying point for demonstrators seeking freedom to travel to the West. Since the opening of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s borders last week, there has been growing speculation and concern about the implications for the East German and West German economies. West German Economics Minister <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON>, in announcing the aid package today, compared his conditional offer to the Marshall Plan put together by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to help <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> recover from World War II destruction. <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> did not name a figure for the proposed aid, and said the plan would be useless if <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> did not carry out a `` thorough change'' of its troubled centrally planned economy. Speaking to reporters in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> said reforms promised by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> had so far led to more questions than answers. The minister said the aid plan being offered by <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> would include massive investments in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and joint ventures, as well as revamping <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s outdated communications and transport system. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> governments in the past have flatly ruled out free-market principles in the Socialist state. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Momper </PERSON> urged the federal government to meet with East German officials to discuss `` pressing economic problems'' created by the sudden opening of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s borders. Among the issues mentioned by Momper were currency problems, traffic and other economic problems. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> was chosen Monday in a session of unprecedented liveliness in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Lawmakers, long subservient to the Communist leadership, voted by secret ballot for the first time and endorsed opposition calls for free elections. They also elected their first non-Communist Parliament speaker. Some deputies even called for stripping the constitution of a clause that designates the country `` socialist.'' The Communist Party daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged today the country is in a `` deep crisis,'' but is experiencing an `` awakening'' leading toward change. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, 61, is an anti-establishment Communist figure who built his power base from his former position as <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief. He replaced <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON>, who resigned last week along with his entire 44-member Cabinet. The new premier supports step-by-step economic reforms, including the scaling down of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ponderous government bureaucracy. Still, <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> said the government has no intention of tearing down the Berlin Wall, despite carving new passages through it for the past five days in an effort to halt an exodus of refugees and growing public unrest. `` In our country there is little criminal activity ... cases of AIDS and drugs are virtually unknown. Our people are asking themselves why they should n't just leave that as it is,'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> as saying. He said doing away with the barrier completely could cause `` chaos,'' echoing the Communist line that the wall was designed to protect <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from threats of the West. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> is to present his Cabinet on Friday. The official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted him as saying Monday night that the country needs a `` real coalition government.'' `` This will naturally be a broader cooperation within our alliance,'' he said, referring to four small Communist-aligned parties that have had Cabinet positions in the past but never important ones. There was no indication he intended to offer Cabinet ministries to opposition leaders. The election of <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> came as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators gathered around the nation, spurred by last week's opening of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s borders with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> They shouted anti-Communist slogans and demanded an end to the party's monopoly on power. In the city of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, about 300,000 people paraded through the streets in what has become a Monday night ritual, chanting `` We are the people!'' Protesters shouted ` Lazy bunch!'' outside the local headquarters of the secret police. <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallig </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> spokesman for New Forum, told <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hesse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> today, `` I can imagine cooperating with a reformed Communist party.'' He praised <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> as a `` competent politician'' but said, `` There are still too many people in top positions with whom dialogue is not possible.'' <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> permanently opened <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s borders Friday in an attempt to stop hundreds of thousands of East Germans from fleeing West and to buy time for his promised reforms. The gamble appears to have paid off. The official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported that more than 5 million visas had been issued since Thursday, but that only about 10,000 people applied to emigrate. Monday's frequently uproarious parliamentary session was the first translation of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s euphoria into concrete political action. During the meeting, some parliamentarians blamed the previous party and state leadership for the economic and social morass that has engulfed this nation of 16.5 million. Party leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was ousted Oct. 18 at the height of the exodus, and there have been calls for the entire party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to step down. The new speaker of Parliament is <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> <PERSON> Maleuda </PERSON>. The Communists did not field a challenger to his candidacy. <PERSON> Maleuda </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasants </ORGANIZATION>, one of four non-Communist parties that had been allowed to exist in exchange for accepting Communist supremacy.

 A district court Tuesday sentenced a Moroccan immigrant to six months in prison for `` disparaging and deeply offending'' remarks about Jews on his radio station, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rami </PERSON> called the ruling against him `` judicial murder'' and said he would appeal the conviction. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s 15,000-member Jewish community has viewed it as a landmark case. It is only the second time that a court has overridden the right of free speech to enforce an anti-racism law barring the defamation of a people, race or ethnic group. <PERSON> Rami </PERSON> was convicted of 18 counts of broadcasting anti-Semitic remarks, including quotes from Nazi writings such as <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s `` Mein Kampf. He has spoken on the air of a Jewish conspiracy to achieve worldwide power. The court ruled the statements were `` clearly disparaging and in many cases deeply offending to Jews, and <PERSON> Rami </PERSON> throughout makes sweeping statements and refers to Jews in general.'' The court acquitted him on charges relating to other remarks on his weekly program, and cautioned that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its supporters must expect political criticism. He also was cleared of all charges in connection with his book, `` What is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The verdict was announced a week ago, but the written judgment and sentence were released Tuesday. `` This is a judicial murder, a scandal, and I intend to appeal,'' <PERSON> Rami </PERSON> told reporters. He said he had been judged in a political trial, and he accused the prosecutor of `` Zionist sympathies.'' `` I want to crush the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. ... If I am allowed on the air again I will say the same things again,'' he said. `` Zionism, Judaism and the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are fakes.'' During the eight-week trial, the prosecution called in distinguished clergymen, including retired Stockholm Lutheran bishop <PERSON> Krister </PERSON> <PERSON> Stendahl </PERSON> and Swedish Chief Rabbi <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Narrowe </PERSON>, to argue that <PERSON> Rami </PERSON>'s programs were anti-Semitic. <PERSON> Rami </PERSON>'s defense was based on the assertion that his programs were not directed against the Jewish people, but against <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> as an ideology and political doctrine. The <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was to decide Wednesday whether to suspend the station's broadcasting permit, <PERSON> Rami </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, like some 2,500 independent companies or individuals, rents air time from the <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and is on the air for one hour a week. `` I'm disappointed in the Swedish legal system,'' he said. `` Criticizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and Jews is called persecution, while criticizing Islam is plain criticism,'' he said, referring to British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rusdie </PERSON> and his novel, `` The Satanic Verses.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said today that Czechoslovak citizens will no longer need exit permits to travel outside the country, a major reform in one of the last hard-line East bloc nations. The announcement comes less than a week after <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> lifted most travel restrictions on its citizens and opened its borders to the West, triggering a flood of visitors to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In an address to the Czechoslovak <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said his government regards `` tourism as the citizens' important right to get to know the world, gain experience and establish personal contacts.'' <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has been among the most resistant countries in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc to the Soviet-style political reforms sweeping <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and now <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. It has crushed public dissent and jailed protesters calling for democratic reforms. Police used truncheons and arrested scores during pro-reform demonstrations in October. During the summer, the government eased some travel restrictions but did not lift the requirement for an exit visa when traveling to the West. Authorities have often refused to allow leading dissidents to travel abroad. In <LOCATION> Washingotn </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hailed the development. `` The people of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> have the same aspirations for freedom that others have, and I would expect we'd see further changes there, just as we have seen in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. -RRB- So it's a very good and encouraging step,'' the president said. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said the government was changing the law to make travel easier. He did not say when the new rule would take effect, but it was expected to begin in January. `` The processing of travel documents is being speeded up,'' <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said. `` For travel to non-socialist countries and to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, exit visas will not be necessary.'' <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is a communist country but is not aligned with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, so travel to it had been restricted. Currently, Czechoslovak citizens wishing to travel West must apply for exit visas with the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Before a trip is authorized, would-be travelers must also obtain stamps from their employers and from military authorities. There is a 3O-day waiting period. In July, the government lifted the rule requiring that invitations for Czechoslovak citizens to visit the West come from family members. It began recognizing invitations from anyone living in the West, including emigres, even those who had left their country illegally. The government had also lifted restrictions on Czechoslovaks wishing to emigrate to join family members who had left the country illegally. Czechoslovaks still will need visas from the countries they wish to visit. Earlier this year, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> began granting visas to Austrian and West German citizens at selected border crossings and speeded up the issuance of visas for Western correspondents. In most cases, they now can receive visas in a day rather than having to wait up to two weeks. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said that the number of visits by Czechoslovak citizens to Western countries increased last year by 30 percent over the previous year. `` Our aim is that <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> become a country for which travel and tourism represent not only a significant sum in the state budget, but also the satisfaction of its citizens,'' <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said in the nationally televised speech.

 A <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall museum featuring a bullet-scarred van, a makeshift ladder and other poignant reminders of ingenuity born of desperation has taken on new meaning with the wall's opening `` We're a real museum now,'' said <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumm </PERSON>, assistant director of the museum in a converted cafe alongside the wall's famed Checkpoint Charlie crossing point `` But the museum must stay and we should open in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, too.

On Thursday, the museum became part of history in a matter of hours after <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> lifted traven its hemmed-in citizens for the first time since the wall was erected on Aug. 13, 1961. Crossing the wall turned from a death-defying atl restrictions otempt to escape into a simple matter of showing an identity card to a border guard. For thousands of East Germans who have flocked to the museum, its exhibits have been a `` surprise and a shock,'' <PERSON> Schumm </PERSON> said. `` Some knew from West German television that escapees had been shot. But in the GDR -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- they'd been told that the reports were lies from the West and only criminals tried to escape.'' He stood beside a little bubble-shaped Isetta car into wchange of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills fell to 7.93 percent as the discount lost 2 basis points to 7.68 percent. Yields on six-month bills fell to 7.83 percent as the discount fell 12 basis points at 7.45 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.73 percent as the discount lost 4 basis points to 7.24 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity.

 Next week's scheduled launch of space shuttle Discovery on a classified military mission will be delayed at least two days because of potential shorts in the wiring assemblies of the two rocket boosters. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said technicians today were removing four integrated electronics assemblies _ two from each of the boosters _ and taking them to the manufacturer's facilities for inspection. `` There is the potential some wiring there could short,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, a space center spokeswoman. A <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> statement later said the launch, which had been scheduled for Nov. 20, would take place `` no earlier than Nov. 22.'' The electronics units are the brains of the boosters, routing power commands and data between the booster rockets and the orbiter. The potential problem showed up in the prelaunch testing.

 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> went on strike for higher wages today, throwing up picket lines on the East and West coasts. The 2,200 unionized seamen, deckhands, stewards and cooks _ who conduct sea rescues, go on Customs and fishery patrols and work aboard government research vessels _ said they would return only in emergencies. None were immediately reported. At the Canadian Forces Base Equimalt on <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> tug was prevented from going on duty when crewmen belonging to the union, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>, refused to cross picket lines, said a base spokesman. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougans </PERSON> said the agency would `` do the best we can, but you can expect some disruptions.'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON>, a director for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> and Oceans, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships may be pressed into service for fishery patrols within <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s 200-mile limit. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a union spokesman, said the `` entire search and rescue operation will not be functioning.'' However, the union and <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's transportation department, agreed to respond to emergencies. The union has been without a contract for two years. One of the major items in dispute is the wage disparity between crewmen on the East and West coasts.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today hailed a move by <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to ease travel restrictions on its citizens and said it is just the latest sign that `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will someday be whole and free.'' `` I'm very pleased at the move in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters at the outset of an Oval Office meeting with Tunisian President <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>. `` The people of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> have the same aspirations for freedom that others have, and I would expect we'd see further changes there, just as we have seen in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. -RRB- So it's a very good and encouraging step,'' the president said. `` This is further manifestation that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> someday will be whole and free. -LRB- Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> talks about ` a common home'; we talk about a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> whole and free. It's a most exciting time.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was responding to the announcement in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> by Czech Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> that Czechoslovak citizens will no longer need exit permits to travel outside the country, a major reform in one of the last hard-line East bloc nations. He did not say when the new rule would take effect, but it was expected to begin in January. Asked if he planned to stop in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to brief the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies after the Dec. 2-3 shipboard summit off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the president said, `` We are thinking right now how we might stay in touch with our allies. That is very, very important.'' Asked if he was concerned that the changes in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were happening too fast, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` No, I do n't think it's moving too fast and I do n't know of anybody in my administration who feels that it's moving too fast.'' Earlier, two well-placed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, facing pressure from Democrats to respond more strongly to the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, is considering a meeting with allied leaders in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> after next month's summit. The aim of a meeting in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> capital would be to show Western unity on the future of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and to discuss new political and military strategy in light of the quickening change that is enveloping Eastern and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favors the $ 738 million aid package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> nearing approval in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We're generally supportive. We'd like to get billions if we had them.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a smaller package. Asked if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would like to see free elections in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We would like to see the people's rights and wills determined by themselves, and we think there is a very constructive course of freedom under way in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the other parts of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> praised the lifting of travel restrictions in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and added, `` We're not surprised by anything anymore.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is under pressure from Democratic leaders in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to respond more energetically to developments in the communist world. Renewing his criticism, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said today it was `` regrettable'' that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, through his spokesman, has rejected the idea of going to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to express <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> satisfaction with the `` symbolic destruction'' of the wall or to normalize trade relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` While the president has rejected all of these, he has reversed himself on issues before and I hold out out hope he will do so again,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> on Monday had urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to travel to the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, now breached by unrestricted travel by East Germans, convene a meeting of the Western allies and suspend trade restrictions against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. House Democratic Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, meanwhile, said: `` At the very time freedom and democracy are receiving standing ovations in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, our president is sitting politely in the audience with little to say and even less to contribute.'' The administration did not respond publicly. But privately, the two officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was weighing a meeting with leaders of the 15 other <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> countries after the Dec. 2-3 talks in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. At the top of the agenda would be the future of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in a speech Monday inevitably will be reunited once <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> shakes off communism. `` <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> because of the communist system,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> `` Do away with the communist system and it's <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' Despite <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s confident statement, a number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials acknowledged in interviews that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had to move cautiously for two reasons: Nervousness in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> about restoring <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to full strength and in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intentions. A militarily powerful <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been at the center of two devastating wars in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this century. The officials told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might propose to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in their talks a reunited but neutralized <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategy, they said, is to undertake preparations within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the European Community for the potential integration of a single <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> into a democratic <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` On this, the Europeans will have to take the lead,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said.

 Students boycotted classes at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> for a second day today to protest state budget cuts.

It's partial,'' Provost <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. The protest was prompted by a $ 25 million cut in aid to public higher education to help eliminate the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> budget deficit. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a junior from <ORGANIZATION> Sunderland </ORGANIZATION> who helped organize the protest, said students today targeted science classes, which many professors agreed to cancel. `` It's been building up all fall,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmertzler </PERSON>, a junior from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. `` They cut out a thousand classes and they expect us to pay more when we ca n't even get into a class.'' The <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> campus' share of the cutback is $ 6.4 million and resulted in a $ 350 increase next semester in the university's mandatory fees to $ 1,465 The fees come in addition to tuition, which was raised 8 percent this fall to $ 1,512. University spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashwell </PERSON> said the faculty union estimated that 60 percent of classes were canceled Monday.

 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> today thanked the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> for its `` unfailing and reliable'' support of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity union and called for swift and heavy investment in his country's fledgling market economy. `` You helped us survive the most difficult days, the moments of despair and hopelessness,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> convention after an emotional welcome from hundreds of labor leaders at a downtown hotel ballroom. `` Now the time has come to thank you; to thank you for your solidarity with Solidarity _ with the cause so many people considered lost and which now, thanks to the stubbornness of Poles and the perseverance of our friends, has put us on the road to victory,'' said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, speaking through a translator. `` Our country needs your experience, your knowledge, your modern technologies,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in his appeal for American investment. `` Do not let the world and us wait any longer.'' The speech, preceded by a video detailing Solidarity's struggle against the Polish government, was repeatedly interrupted by standing ovations from delegates. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> received a hero's welcome, entering the huge convention hall to cheers and applause. Scores of delegates reached out to shake his hand as Coordinated Clearance and Settlement Act, which also passed the subcommittee.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> moved today toward agreement on a compromise $ 738 million plan to spur the rebirth of democracy and free enterprise in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The bipartisan compromise was announced less than 48 hours before <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity union movement, was to address a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Formal approval of the plan, expected today, would be an important step toward resolving a long dispute over the size of the program. `` It almost sounds trite to say that what is happening in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is mind-boggling, but thank God for it,'' Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, said as the debate resumed this morning. `` We must do all we can afford, as quickly as we can, to help make these changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> irreversible,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved his amendment to earmark 10 percent of the private enterprise funds contained in the bill for Solidarity and a Polish free-enterprise association. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said the change was necessary to permit some of the money to move quickly, cutting through bureaucratic delays as applications are considered. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats originally had sought a three-year authorization level for the two East European nations of $ 989 millions, while Republicans called for a $ 585 million ceiling. All the proposals, including the $ 840 million authorized earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, overshadow the total $ 455 million proposed over the last several months by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Asked today if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favors the $ 738 million aid package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> nearing approval in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We're generally supportive. We'd like to get billions if we had them. Differences between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions of the aid package are expected to be resolved quickly. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> builds on key elements advocated by the president, including an Enterprise Fund to help both nations move away from communist centralized planning and toward free-market systems. The funds, intended to help both countries establish free-market systems, would allocate $ 260 million for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and $ 65 million for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. In recognition of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s serious economic problems, the bill allocates $ 657 million for that country while <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would receive $ 81 million. Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> noted Democrats had dropped a $ 200 million credit stabilization plan for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, a plan he said Republicans believed would be unworkable and merely add to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s large foreign debt. The compromise trimmed the rival <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> plan to `` a more realistic size,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> remain members of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, according to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who said the compromise has a number of safeguards, including barring any funds from being used for military aid to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats opened fire on the president's approach to other crucial events in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s decision to open the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> wall 28 years after it was erected across the divided city. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said today it is `` regrettable'' that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has rejected the idea of going to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to express <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> satisfaction with the `` symbolic destruction'' of the wall or to normalize trade relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` While the president has rejected all of these, he has reversed himself on issues before and I hold out out hope he will do so again,'' the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrat told reporters. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he also believes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should convene an emergency conference of the Western allies to chart the future of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the light of events in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Obviously the post-World-War II era is coming to an end, marked by the upheaval in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the new economic era order in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. It is important, he said, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now assert its full leadership in `` shaping that new order.'' Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday he could n't `` foresee any set of circumstances at this moment that would induce'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to go to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> unanimously adopted a resolution welcoming the opening of the wall, condemning it as a `` symbol of oppression'' and demanding.

 The editor and advertising director of a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> university's student newspaper have been suspended for running an advertisement promoting nationwide abortion rights activities. `` Stand up, be counted while you still have the chance,'' the ad in the <ORGANIZATION> Marquette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said, promoting pro-choice rallies held Sunday. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, 21, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Marquette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student publication, and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristofek </PERSON>, 21, advertising director, said they were suspended Monday for the rest of the semester. They also said a non-student official of the publication was dismissed because of the ad. `` The pro-choice rally ad that was run was clearly in violation of the university standards and university policy,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Marquette </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, Journalism and Performing Arts. `` It should not have run.'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Marquette </ORGANIZATION> vice president for academic affairs, issued a statement saying the newspaper's advertising policy was being studied `` to ensure the publication of that type of ad will not occur again.'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the ad was placed as part of a national advertising account, but newspaper officials were aware of the content. `` We discussed the ad. We were the ones who decided whether it should run or not,'' he said. `` We decided to run it and we were wrong.'' He said the students responsible for the decision did not entirely understand the university policy covering such ads. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, a senior from the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> area, and <PERSON> Kristofek </PERSON>, a senior from <LOCATION> Winfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, both said they planned to resume their jobs with the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> when the suspensions end in January. `` I have to be upset,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. `` But what am I going to do? What I need to do is use this time to evaluate what we've done and get ready for next semester.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, editors of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student newspaper decided not to publish Friday's edition when officials of that Roman Catholic university ruled they could not run an ad urging participation in the weekend pro-choice activities.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> mess sergeant rolled up the sleeve of his jungle fatigues, squirted a few drops of milk near the American flag tattooed on his brawny arm and handed the bottle to the bawling East German infant. `` Getting real good at this,'' laughed Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Levonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, first cook with the 6th infantry battalion, which for the past week has been operating a soup kitchen for refugees pouring through the new holes in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. `` <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> chicken soup is on the menu today,'' he said. `` Yesterday we fed about 5,000. Today looks even bigger. People were on line in the dark and cold when I got here at 5 a.m. to turn on the portable stoves.'' The next infant in line was attached to his mother by the headphones of a portable cassette recorder, the first tangible evidence of the family's flight to freedom. `` He's jamming,'' approved <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, doling out a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to the newest hard rock recruit and a package of disposable diapers to the beaming mother. Less than three decades ago _ Oct. 27, 1961 _ when the Cold War was at its hottest, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patton </LOCATION> tanks confronted low-slung Soviet tanks in a tense 16-hour standoff at Checkpoint Charlie. Now the might of the American military in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was on `` diaper detail,'' responding with British and French allies to requests by the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> city government to provide emergency food and bedding for the refugees. They are bedded down on army cots in schools, sports halls, garages and factories. Some are even sleeping in their tiny East Germans cars. `` Many already have health problems,'' said <PERSON> Kristian </PERSON> <PERSON> Binde </PERSON>, a paramedic with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. He was helping process the new arrivals at the army soup kitchen on the third floor of a derelict elevator factory where the elevators no longer work. `` They have headaches and trouble with breathing from the smog, and now that the weather has turned so chilly, chest colds are common, especially among the children,'' he said. `` In cases of really serious illness, like a heart attack, the open border now works both ways. We can send them across to the <ORGANIZATION> Humboldt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.'' Some have problems with alcohol. `` They celebrate their new freedom too much and wind up in an ambulance,'' <PERSON> Binde </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, the recently resigned East German leader, was given the assignment of building the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall after midnight on a summer Sunday in 1961 because the best and the brightest under Communist control were defecting to the West. In the previous half dozen years, more than 17,000 engineers and technicians and 6,000 doctors and nurses had fled. Apparently, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s professional class is on the move again. At a table in the soup kitchen, filling out papers that hopefully might find them work, were nurse <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiering </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON>, an electrical engineer. With their 11-year-old son they had left <PERSON> Robel </PERSON>, a small town 70 miles to the north, and had no idea where they would settle. `` Perhaps <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Spiering </PERSON>, who has been plotting the family exodus for months. `` We are lucky. We stay with an uncle here in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The boy is very happy _ he does n't have to go back to school yet.'' <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorg </PERSON> <PERSON> Patzig </PERSON>, a refugee coordinator for the city of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, said a lot of doctors arrived last week. `` This is a problem, because a lot of doctors here in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> are unemployed. We have more doctors than we need. Also public health education standards are not very high on the other side, so a lot of them could be bad doctors,'' he said. The government is providing free flights to take the refugees to jobs in other West German cities, <PERSON> Patzig </PERSON> said, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> provides buses to take them to the airport. But even the skilled technicians and engineers have not kept pace with the West's computer chip technology. `` We get a number of printers and linotype operators who do n't realize all our newspapers here are done by the offset process,'' he said `` People in the building trades _ carpenters, plumbers, roofers _ will have no trouble getting work.'' Bus driver <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammermann </PERSON> is among the volunteers collecting clothing and blankets for the refugees. He remembers `` the confrontation between the American and the Soviets on <LOCATION> Friedrichstrasse </LOCATION>. We lived close by. I hid with my grandparents in the cellar. They thought World War III was about to begin.'' For Thanksgiving, <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> hopes to serve `` the best of the West'' to the new converts to democracy filling his soup kitchen. `` Real turkey soup, not the dehydrated stuff,'' he said. `` I'll carve up a couple of dozen birds, get me some onions, celery, peppers, potatoes, and we'll show them what freedom is all about.

 A firefighter used mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and oxygen to revive a pair of 2-week-old kittens overcome in a fire that damaged a house. `` We did it once before on a puppy, but it was too late,'' said Fire Department rescue specialist A.J. Green. `` I do love animals.'' No people were injured in the blaze, but firefighters found four kittens in the house and took them outside, said Battalion Chief D.R. <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON>. A neighbor began chest massage on a kitten that was not breathing and <PERSON> Green </PERSON> began mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a second unresponsive kitten. The other two kittens died. After both surviving kittens started to breathe on their own, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> gave them oxygen. Following about 20 minutes of rescue efforts, a neighbor took the now-active kittens home for the night.

 Former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told troubled teen-agers Tuesday that everything happens for a purpose _ even bad things. `` I know you have n't had it easy,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told more than 120 young people at Covenant House. `` There must have been times when you wondered if anyone cared.'' `` People do care,'' he assured them. `` I care about you and that's why I'm here.'' Covenant House shelters about 25,000 runaway, homeless or neglected children each year at houses in three nations and seven states. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visited the agency's building in the <LOCATION> Chelsea </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, where he handed out writing pens and spoke briefly. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the youths that when he was young his family was poor and his father was an alcoholic. `` There were nights when I was angry and frustrated and wondered, ` Why?''' But he said he was sustained by his mother, who insisted `` everything happens for a reason. ... Down the road something good will happen, and you'll realize it was for the best.'' He gave an example: During the Depression he went to the <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> department store in his <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> town and applied for work. When he was turned down, he recalled, `` I felt about as low as could be.''

He was working on a film in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> at the time. `` And now, I'm not sure when I'll be able to get out there. If the play is lucky, we'll be here'till spring. Then I'll be six months in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> on a film. `` I do n't think I'll be back out until maybe a year from Christmas.''

<HEAD>Egyptians-Iraqis to Discuss Deaths of Egyptians in Iraq.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Senior Egyptian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> officials will discuss the welfare of about 1 million Egyptian workers in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> following reports that more than 100 Egyptians died in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> last month. `` The foreign ministry is following the issue of Egyptian workers in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and this will be reviewed during the meeting of the higher joint Egyptian-Iraqi committee on Saturday,'' said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON>. The government has been handling the affair cautiously, and he did not refer to reports in the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> al-Akhbar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper that 102 bodies of Egyptians had been flown to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> in October, compared with one body in October 1988. The newspaper also reported that `` thousands'' of Egyptians were buried in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> because they did not leave enough money for their bodies to be sent home, and that Egyptians were badly treated by Iraqis. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Akhbar </ORGANIZATION> also reported that starting Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> would start 10 extra flights from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> daily for the next three months to fly home Egyptian workers. It quoted Iraqi officials in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> as saying return of Egyptian workers in large numbers was not because of `` maltreatment'' but because soldiers discharged after Iran-Iraq war ended were taking jobs once held by Egyptians. Some Egyptian government officials and the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> al-Wafd </ORGANIZATION> attribute most of the Egyptian deaths to friction between Iraqis and Egyptians and rivalries over jobs. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Akhbar </ORGANIZATION> said Prime Minister <PERSON> Atef </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedki </PERSON> demanded a full report from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouf </PERSON>. On Monday, a senior security official at <ORGANIZATION> Cairo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> confirmed that about 100 Egyptian bodies were flown from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in October, an average of `` three or four'' a day. The official also said autopsies have been ordered to determine the cause of the death. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Akhbar </ORGANIZATION> said that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> certificates initially attributed death to `` bullet wounds'' and later switched to other formulas like `` killed in an accident'' or `` died in butane gas cylinder explosion.'' The Egyptian government has been cautious in handling the issue because of close ties between the two countries. Millions of Egyptians work abroad, about 1 million in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. One Egyptian security official said he did not believe the bodies arriving in recent weeks were related to reports of an August explosion and fire at an Iraqi missile plant that killed 700 people, including many Egyptians. The high death toll was reported by Iraqi dissident sources and the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper The Independent.

<TEXT>
 Lawyers for the state asked the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today to rule that a quadriplegic with no hope of improvement has the right to shut off the machine that has kept him alive for four years. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Droze </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McAfee </PERSON>'s death if he disconnected his ventilator would not be suicide but the result `` of the natural progression of his condition.'' <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION>, whose motorcycle injuries four years ago left him paralyzed from the neck down and dependent on a respirator, already won consent in September from a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge to disconnect the breathing apparatus. After ruling in the case, Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> instructed Attorney General <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> to appeal to the state's highest court for guidance in future cases. <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> decided to delay shutting off his ventilator, offering others more time to try to talk him out of it. But his attorney, <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, urged the court to uphold the ruling, saying that would amount to an affirmation of `` a competent adult's right to refuse medical treatment.'' The trial judge held that <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION>'s constitutional right to privacy permitted him to disconnect the respirator and that the state had no interests outweighing <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION>'s right to refuse medical treatment. With a friend's help, <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> devised a method by which he could turn the respirator off himself. But he also asked to be given a sedative so that he would not suffer once the respirator was removed. On that point, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> ruled that any physician or lawman who administered a sedative to <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> or who helped him in turning off the respirator would not be subject to any civil or criminal liability. <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> said Monday the issue is legally murky and should be resolved by the state's highest court. `` The question, I believe, is whether what we have is explicit and clear enough concerning the right of a competent person to refuse medical treatment,'' <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> said. `` We believe that if you take the law as a whole and try to distill it, you come up with this right. But we acknowledge there is nothing one could point to and say, ` There is this right.''' <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> and other parties in the lawsuit have urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to use the case to write guidelines allowing people similarly situated in the future to gain the removal of life-sustaining equipment through non-judicial means. The state already has such guidelines for people who have signed a `` living will'' directing their physicians not to engage in heroic means to preserve them in a non-conscious state. Although most `` right-to-die'' cases involve comatose patients or those who can not make their wishes known, a case similar to <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION>'s came up in July. A <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> man paralyzed in a surfing accident died after a court decided he had the right to have his life-support system shut off.

 Squads of men armed with iron tongs and a poisonous liquid are prowling this populous city's streets and alleys with one mission in mind: kill as many dogs as possible. Authorities say they have no choice. `` We know it is cruelty to kill the dogs,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Rezaul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON>, chief veterinarian of the <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> Municipal Crporation. `` We must find out an alternative.'' <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> said the explosion in the numbers of stray dogs has created a potential health threat. About 30 dogs are killed daily, which puts only a small dent in a population estimated in the tens of thousands. He said eight dog-killing squads began operating in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> on Oct. 1 and killed at least 646 stray dogs in one month. `` The campaign will continue'' until all stray dogs are killed, he said. The dogs are caught by large iron tongs and a poisonous solution of magnesium sulfate is injected into the heart, killing the animals within two minutes, said a corporation veterinarian who spoke on condition of anonymity. There is no dependable estimate of the street dog population of the capital, the country's largest city with 6 million people. Officials believe the figure is between 70,000 and 80,000. `` September-October is the breeding season for dogs when their population sometimes reaches 80,000,'' said <PERSON> Karim </PERSON>. The corporation pays 10 takas, about 30 cents, to the dog catchers for every canine captured and killed. Authorities say the main complaints against the animals are that they are likely to bite people and spread rabies. There are no statistics on dog bites, but newspapers often report dogs attacking and biting people at night when streets are deserted. An official of the <ORGANIZATION> Veterinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has offered about $ 2.5 million for a project to vaccinate stray dogs against diseases. The extermination has not evoked any public reaction. Few Bangladeshis keep pets, and there is no branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruelty </ORGANIZATION> to Animals in the country. In 1978, some owners of pet dogs formed a kennel club, but it closed in 1980. `` The dog-killing campaign is deplorable,'' said <PERSON> Sadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chowdhury </PERSON>, a TV newscaster who was a member of the kennel club.

 <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, promoting a cautious brand of reform, will convert part of its renowned munitions industry to civilian production, a senior <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> official said Tuesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businessmen are invited to join the new ventures and also to use <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> as a beachhead to potential Soviet and other East European markets, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumann </PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. He spoke as <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, trailing its neighbors in political reform, announced the lifting of restrictions on foreign travel by its citizens. `` We are highly interested in the quickest conversion of armament production capacities and shift toward the civil sector production,'' <PERSON> Sumann </PERSON> said. His statements reflected recent cautious efforts by <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to join the trend toward `` perestroika,'' or restructuring, now bringing dramatic changes in its <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact neighbors, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In reforming the economy, `` we would like to intensify trade and cooperation with the West,'' he asserted. Cooperation `` with the former arms producers could ... be of great interest to foreign partners, because of the existing modern capacities and qualified personnel in the Czechoslovak armament industry,'' <PERSON> Sumann </PERSON> said. Czechoslovak industry, led by the <ORGANIZATION> Skoda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plzen </ORGANIZATION>, producers of tanks and artillery, has been considered a major arsenal of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other pact nations. Despite a long industrial tradition, the country's economy is stagnating from `` overregulation, overtaxation and overspending,'' <PERSON> Sumann </PERSON> said, and one of the most important cost-cutting measures will be `` overall reduction of armament production.'' He gave no figures on the planned cut. <PERSON> Sumann </PERSON> also said his country needs `` more democracy in public life,'' but emphasized a gradual approach to reform by the hard-line communist leadership. The economic reform in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> will be gradual, he said. `` We prefer a pragmatic step-by-step approach, and are determined to avoid chaos in the transition.'' He made no mention of privatizing the country's many government industries.

 The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today took up a bill that could give <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> the most restrictive abortion law in the country. If the measure is passed and signed as expected by Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> could become the first state to take advantage of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in July allowing new curbs on abortion. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure 143-58 last month. The Senate Rules Committee on Monday endorsed the bill 11-5 without discussion. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, a pro-choice Republican from suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, noted that anti-abortion forces held the votes to pass the bill and said as the debate got under way, `` We're about to cross an historic threshold.'' <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> has traditionally been strongly anti-abortion. Before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> session, more than 100 anti-abortion activists held a prayer vigil in the Capitol rotunda. Outside, several high school students from suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> ripped open cardboad boxes and wrote slogans saying, `` Come help to do the right thing _ Keep it legal ... Vote pro-choice.'' `` We think this country was founded on choice and we need to have choice in this country,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, a high school senior. A few steps away was an anti-aborttion sign with a graphic picture of an aborted fetus, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag and the words, `` Abortion, babies suffer brutal pain.'' <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> said it had delivered 50,000 names on petitions and thousands of letters from pro-choice advocates to the office of Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Singel </PERSON>, who presides over the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The bill would require women to notify their husbands if they plan to get an abortion; prohibit abortions because of the fetus' sex; ban abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy except in cases where the mother faces death or irreversible harm, and establish a 24-hour waiting period Also, the proposal would regulate the medical use of tissue from aborted fetuses, and doctors would be required to inform a woman of the likely age of the fetus before performing an abortion and explain the risks and alternatives. An attempt by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> to take advantage of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision upholding a restrictive <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion law fell flat last month when the Legislature flatly rejected a package of bills. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, senators favoring a pro-choice position have usually accounted for fewer than 20 votes in the 50-member chamber. Sen. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilt </PERSON>, a pro-choice Republican, said he would offer amendments calling for a referendum on the bill, eliminating the requirement that husbands be notified, and revising the waiting period so that women living 50 or more miles from a clinic would have to make only one trip. Because of a maze of procedural rules, pro-choice senators were expected to face a tough time getting the amendments even considered. At least 26 members must first approve a motion to consider amendments before any can be offered. Around the Capitol, there was no sign of the swarms of protesters that gathered before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote. Senators said they received more calls than usual, and mail on abortion was heavy.

 Leftist guerrillas waging war against the government today declared parts of the country `` liberated territory'' and a resident said rebels in a northern neighborhood advanced to new positions. New casualty estimates put the number of dead at nearly 470. The government rejected the rebels' claims. `` The situation is almost totally under control of the army,'' said <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Salavarria </PERSON>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A rebel communique said guerrillas had liberated parts of eight of the country's 14 provinces. It said people's governments would be established in them. At least 466 people have been killed in the fighting that has paralyzed the capital since Saturday night, when the leftist guerrillas mounted their largest offensive of the 10-year-old civil war. Despite the government denials, it was clear that rebels held parts of northern and eastern neighborhoods in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, controlling some from positions in tall buildings. The armed forces declared a 24-hour curfew today in seven neighborhoods, saying it was because of the danger of snipers. Thousands of residents were trapped after combat intensified Monday night between rebels and the government, whose jets and helicopter gunships rocketed rebel positions in poor neighborhoods. Looting was reported in supermarkets in some poor neighborhoods. Rebel leaders in the occupied zones called on the armed forces to observe a brief cease-fire to allow residents to get food, water and medical supplies. An armed forces spokesman said he was not authorized to respond to the proposal. As combat intensified, hundreds of people fled the densely populated <LOCATION> Zacamil </LOCATION> neighborhood, a working class area. Residents said they feared the army would attack. A photographer was unable to enter the zone because of the heavy fighting. One Zacamil resident said by telephone that the rebels were advancing and taking up new positions closer to military installations. Civilian casualties were high as government troops and rebels exchanged gunfire in densely populated districts. Along a wide arc on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s northern fringe, rebels installed themselves in homes and apartments and put snipers in church towers and tall buildings. People in rebel-held areas said food and water were in short supply. Fighting intensified Monday night in northeastern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> when rebels attacked the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benito </LOCATION> national police batallion near the military headquarters. `` We came down from the mountains and we're going to stay here,'' a guerrilla who identified himself only as <PERSON> Porfirio </PERSON> said earlier Monday. `` We're winning so far and we have their morale down.'' He gestured with his AK-47 assault rifle toward soldiers in the distance. `` The combat is hard, the boys -LRB- guerrillas -RRB- are in all the high buildings and control the movement of the soldiers,'' said a rescue worker with the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. Col. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a spokesman for the joint chiefs of staff, said today that 309 guerrillas and 106 soldiers had died in the fighting nationwide. He gave the number of civilian deaths as 17, but morgues on Monday said there were at least 51. Hospitals said 421 civilians had been injured in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said 160 guerrillas, 231 soldiers and 86 civilians had been wounded. Medical workers at the main public hospital said the majority of people brought in today had been wounded by rocket fire in northern, eastern and southern parts of the city. Few of the city's 1 million people were on the streets Monday and nearly all downtown stores were closed. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said 1,500 of the rebels' estimated 7,000 regulars were fighting in the capital. The government has 45,000 soldiers. The embassy listed the six other provinces where combat was reported as <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Usulutan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vicente </LOCATION>. The rebels launched the offensive with attacks on 35 to 40 military outposts in the capital and provinces. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, 85 miles to the east, a hospital employee said Monday by telephone, `` We have heard the fighting since Saturday. The guerrillas have occupied outlying neighborhoods and the people are discouraged, without electricity, and only some people dare to go out.'' The rebels said the offensive was intended to pressure the rightist government into negotiating in good faith. They suspended peace talks last week to protest the Oct. 31 bombing of a leftist union hall that killed 10 people, blaming the government. President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> on Sunday announced a state of siege, suspending free speech, freedom of movement and the right to assemble. He also imposed a dust-to-dawn curfew. Television stations broadcast their usual programs, but were not allowed to transmit news. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who took office in June, heads the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. His party has been linked to death squads that operated with virtual impunity early in the war and are blamed for most of the 70,000 deaths in the conflict. Most victims were civilians. Col. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, the armed forces chief of staff, said Monday night in a television address that government troops had encountered `` problems'' in neighborhoods around the capital. He insisted, however, that `` there is no zone under their -LRB- rebel -RRB- control.'' Military planes fired rockets Monday afternoon into the eastern neighborhoods of <LOCATION> Venecia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Conacaste </PERSON>, trying to drive out guerrillas. Some rockets struck homes, killing several civilians and wounding others. <LOCATION> Ponce </LOCATION>, however, insisted `` The air force has not bombed anywhere in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.'' He said: `` The men in uniform are working 24 hours a day and soon we will gain control.'' The rebels' Radio Venceremos claimed every army attempt to reclaim rebel positions `` has turned into a profound bloodbath among their troops and elite corps. They have lost whole companies, producing a big demoralization in enemy ranks.'' The insurgents said their presence in urban zones `` has begun to produce popular uprisings.''

<TEXT>
 A British tycoon who set a hot-air balloon distance record two years ago despite crashing into the sea is about to try to break the record with a 6,200-mile flight across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> plans to lift off from southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, possibly as early as this weekend, with ballooning expert <PERSON> Per </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindstrand </PERSON>, who was the pilot in the 1987 record-setting flight over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. If all goes well, they will touch down four days later in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` The weatherman is God on this venture,'' <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> said. `` He's got a difficult equation to work out. Ideal weather would be no wind on takeoff, 200 mph winds in the jet stream, and no wind for the landing. Getting ready for a perilous flight is not all <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> is doing in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Before the interview, he met with <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials to seek more flights on his <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' new <LOCATION> London-Tokyo </LOCATION> route. Later he was visiting <ORGANIZATION> Fujisankei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the Japanese media company that recently bought a quarter of <PERSON> Branson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> for $ 150 million The 39-year-old <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> dropped out of school at 15 to concentrate on business and is one of the richest men in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. His adventures, which also include crossing the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> by speedboat, are as much free advertising for his company as personal challenges. None of his money will be needed for the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> flight, he said, refusing to estimate the cost if sponsors had n't been found for everything. `` All my adventures of this kind I've done on the basis that it would n't cost us any money,'' he said. The balloon, said to be the largest ever built, is named <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Otsuka </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacific </PERSON> <PERSON> Flyer </PERSON>, honoring <ORGANIZATION> Otsuka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION>, which makes a popular health drink and is footing among other local costs the upkeep of 60 people at the launch site. A <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> balloon crossing has been done only once, in 1981 by three Americans and a Japanese with a helium balloon. <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> said he and Lindstrand hope to take their balloon possibly as high as 40,000 feet. `` A balloon has never attempted this before _ to push our balloon into this very fast jet stream,'' he said, describing the planned ascent into winds up to 200 mph. `` The top of the balloon might be going 150 mph and the bottom might be going only 50 mph. As we're going in, we'll be clinging on for dear life as the top of the balloon heads off at great speed and hope we do n't get left behind.'' Many weather balloons break up in the jet stream, he said, but they do n't have his strong new fabric of metallic polyester film bonded to nylon. Other possible downsides: bad weather, breakdown of compressors that keep the gondola's air livable, malfunction of the propane burners that provide the heat to keep the balloon aloft, sudden decompression _ `` We have eight seconds to put on oxygen masks'' _ or some disaster that might force <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> and Lindstrand to skydive from altitudes where the temperature is as low as minus 58. Their training has included skydiving and physical conditioning to help ward off seasickness if they ditch at sea and have to wait to be rescued, as happened in the 1987 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> trip. At that time, the 21-story-high balloon briefly touched down in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and then flew out of control and splashed into the sea a mile of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Both fliers were pulled from the water, but they were credited with a distance record of 2,280 miles from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to the point of touchdown. `` I'm confident we wo n't lose our lives,'' <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> said. `` I'm absolutely convinced it can be done Whether we will succeed in doing it the first time, we wo n't know for two weeks. But as with anything else we do in life, if we fail the first time, we'll be back again next year to make sure we finish the job off.''

<TEXT>
 Relaxed travel and emigration restrictions stemming from reforms in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc are allowing more East Eh the West. The country-by-country situation:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> CZECHOSLOVAKIA </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, one of the last hard-line East bloc nations, announced Tuesday it would no longer require exit permits for travel outside the country. The governmuropeans to reacent previously had eased some restrictions but had kept the requirement for an exit visa when traveling to the West.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 EAST <LOCATION> GERMANY </LOCATION> _ More than 3 million East German visitors have crossed into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since the Communist country opened its borders Nov. 9. The government provides a travel visa to nearly anyone who applies. The changes were prompted by the illegal exodus of tens of thousands of people to the West and by massive demonstrations. East Germans t <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, as are ethnic Germans from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, which helps account for the huge emigration influx into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this year. The newly opened <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall could conceivably become a new passage for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc visitors allowed to travel to other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations like <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but who have difficulty getting permission to go West.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> SOVIET </LOCATION> <LOCATION> UNION </LOCATION> _ Requirements for travel documents and permission to emigrate have eased tremendously in the last two years. On Monday, the Soviet legislature gave preliminary approval to a bill lifting most travel restrictions. It would allow emigration for virtually anyone who has entry permission from another country and no outstanding alimony obligations, criminal charges or recent knowledge of state secrets. An estimated 200,000 will emigrate in 1989 and more than 2 million will make visits abroad. Most emigrants go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> POLAND </LOCATION> _ Any Polish citizen is eligible for a passport for all countries and can travel without problem. The main problem for Poles is not getting a passport, but getting a visa from the countries they want to visit. It often takes weeks to get a visa at the West German or <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies because so many people want to go to those countries. In 1988, 6.5 million Poles traveled abroad, including 1.5 million to the West.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> HUNGARY </LOCATION> _ Beginning Jan. 1, 1989, Hungarians were allowed to apply for five-year passports giving them the right to travel West as often as they can afford. By June 30, Hungarians had made 3.8 million trips abroad, 18 percent up from the first half of 1987.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> BULGARIA </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> in September passed a law similar to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s with passports issued for five years. Bulgarians who are refused a travel document have a right to appeal the decision. As in many East bloc countries, the major drawback to traveling West is a shortage of convertible currency.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> ROMANIA </LOCATION> _ In this most hard-line <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact state, <LOCATION> Romanians </LOCATION> are allowed to travel to the West only once every two years, and to other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries once a year. Romanians under retirement age are virtually prevented from traveling West at all except in urgent family matters, although pensioners can travel more freely.

 Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> urged the government to ban L-tryptophan, a dietary supplement suspected of causing a potentially fatal blood illness in 17 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Health officials were investigating whether one death was caused by the non-prescription remedy touted as `` nature's sleeping pill.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on Monday banned L-tryptophan. Oregon's Health Division recommended the product be withdrawn, and other states are expected to issue warnings. The number of reported cases nationwide of the disorder eosinophilia reached 81 Monday, said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. The congressman was briefed by the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. The Food and Drug Administration over the weekend warned consumers to temporarily stop taking L-tryptophan, which is sold in health food stores to treat sleeplessness and premenstrual syndrome. <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, asked the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to go a step further and halt L-tryptophan sales nationwide until the product's role in the eosinophilia outbreak is known. `` The entire nation could be at risk,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen did not immediately return a call today, but the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that samples of tablets tested by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> so far have turned up `` no obvious contaminants.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said it, too, is analyzing samples. At least 12 different brands of L-tryptophan have been identified as having been used by the individuals who became ill in recent weeks. Makers of L-tryptophan have said they do n't believe their product is to blame for the outbreak, although they said small, disreputable companies may have produced contaminated batches. Eosinophilia is an abnormal elevation of a type of white blood cells, known as eosinophils. Symptoms include severe muscle pain, fever, joint pain and weakness. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Health </LOCATION> and Environment Secretary <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said the ban followed an investigation that ruled out other causes for the outbreak. Most New <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> health stores and drug stores have voluntarily removed L-tryptophan from their shelves. The order, which is in effect until further notice, required all retail dealers to pull the product. State epidemiologist Dr. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON> said 30 cases of eosinophilia have been reported in six <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> cities. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, deputy state epidemiologist in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, said a woman from his state took L-tryptophan, developed eosinophilia-like symptoms in January and died in midsummer in another state while seeking treatment. The Oregonian of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> reported today that investigators were looking to see if her death was related to L-tryptophan. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Schafer </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> would probably recommend its use be discontinued pending an investigation. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> was issuing a warning today not to use the product until more studies are done. Potential cases of eosinophilia has been confirmed in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said today. Sixteen people died nationwide in 1986 as a result of hypereosinophilic syndrome, a form of eosinophilia, and 12 died in 1987, said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s official human rights group said Tuesday the government has delayed reform but he hopes for faster action from leaders who took over for <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, the ousted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief. <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, 78, resigned Friday after 35 years of enforcing a rigid, orthodox line in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. He was succeeded by <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, 53, who served 18 years as foreign minister and is considered more amenable to change. <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tellalov </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he actively seeks legal reforms to guarantee human rights. Independent activists, however, are suspicious of the commission's role. Before and after the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was set up about 1 -LCB- years ago, unofficial groups have been established that criticize government policy on the environment, human rights and labor. Some of their leaders accuse <PERSON> Tellalov </PERSON>'s commission of promoting government policy. Reports since Friday have indicated extensive changes are imminent in the top ranks of the party and government, and <PERSON> Tellalov </PERSON> expressed hope that would help the work of his organization. <PERSON> Tellalov </PERSON> was ousted from the ruling Politburo in the 1960s _ for being too outspoken, it is said _ and afterward served as ambassador to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. Most recently, he was Bulgarian delegate to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> committee on disarmament in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. He also said official media had been reluctant to publish or broadcast his appeals. As an example, <PERSON> Tellalov </PERSON> said, no publicity was given a resolution the commission adopted in July urging the government to determine who was responsible for bloody suppression of protests by ethnic Turks two months earlier. `` Some 15 Bulgarian journalists attended the news conference when we presented the resolution, but it was not published anywhere,'' he said. At least seven people were killed in May when force was used against ethnic Turks who protested an earlier campaign of force to make them adopt Bulgarian names. Western diplomats later said up to 30 people may have been killed. <PERSON> Tellalov </PERSON> said Tuesday the commission resolution also called on the Turks, officially referred to as a Moslem minority, to reconsider leaving the country and asked <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> to treat the new arrivals well. About 320,000 of the 1.5 million Bulgarian Turks fled religious and cultural discrimination, but nearly 60,000 have returned because they could not find jobs or housing. During the interview Tuesday, <PERSON> Tellalov </PERSON> said his commission was pressing for constitutional changes to limit the death penalty, which he said was included in 30 sections of the penal code. When asked about the approximately 200 political prisoners reported held in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, he acknowledged it was realitvely easy to be convicted of a political crime. Members of his commission had been allowed to visit eight political prisoners in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tellalov </PERSON> said. He criticized failure to make the constitution conform with international covenants on human rights signed by <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. A commission for that purpose, led by <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, was established in 1988 but has never met, <PERSON> Tellalov </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is deciding whether to pull its employees out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after some said they were targets of gunshots and a death threat, a spokesman for the Japanese automaker and other sources said Tuesday. Three <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> employees believe they were shot at while playing golf in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Sunday, three days after <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> office received an anonymous death threat, Japanese sources in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said on condition of anonymity. A letter received by the office Thursday contained a bullet and ordered Japanese businessmen to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or face death, they said. `` We are taking the letter fairly seriously,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, who would not disclose the letter's contents. `` We are currently working on details of whether to pull our people out to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' The Japanese sources quoted the letter as saying, `` Now that the martial law troops are gone, our time has come. Go back to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. From now, we will kill you Japanese.'' Soldiers with automatic rifles were deployed on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> streets under martial law after the army's crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in early June, but were removed Nov. 1. Only a few armed police stand guard in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, primarily at Tiananmen Square. The Japanese Embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to investigate the letter and the reported gunshots, a Japanese diplomat said. About 170 golfers, mostly Japanese, were on the course just before lunchtime when some of them heard what sounded like bullets whizzing by, said the diplomat, who refused to be further identified. Witnesses, however, reported hearing two bursts of machine-gun fire and believed 20-30 shots were fired, other Japanese sources said. Some of the bullets hit trees on the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> near the golfers, the sources said. The golf course is slightly more than a mile from a shooting range where people can rent hand guns, rifles and machine guns for target practice. Three <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> employees heard the shots, which were believed to be stray shots from the rifle range, the <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said. `` There was no feeling of threat to their lives, but they felt uneasy and left the course immediately,'' he said. In July and August, letters sent to Japanese firms, including <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and signed by the `` Blood-Bright Dare to Die Squad,'' threatened to kill Japanese for their `` economic invasion'' of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has a large trade surplus with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and tourists from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are a major source of foreign capital. After last summer's threats, security was increased at Japanese offices and hotels that are home to many Japanese businessmen Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> said Tuesday before he left for a visit to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> that the shooting was `` merely an accident'' and that authorities are investigating. `` Such an event could occur in any other country and I want to say that in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> there will be no greater number of such incidents than in any other country,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said he doubted the incidents would affect investment from overseas. `` Just recently when I received an economic delegation from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, that Japanese delegation was very optimistic about making investments in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and about carrying out economic and technological cooperation with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. Foreign businessmen have expressed concern over the political and investment climate in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 Voters decided two bitter city commission races Tuesday, with the only elected black on the commission locked in a tough re-election battle. <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Elections officials expected 36 percent of the registered voters to turn out for the runoff elections. Two-term incumbent <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, 64, said he did n't believe his was `` the black seat,'' but he also said the city's blacks _ with about 30 percent of the voters _ deserved representation on the commission. He was challenged by <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>, 34, a Cuban-born former commissioner whose Spanish-language ads suggested `` all the Cubans vote for <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>.'' In the other race, former commissioner <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 44, trying to regain the seat she resigned this summer for an unsuccessful run at <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, faced <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON>, 48.

 <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, an administrator at <ORGANIZATION> Miami-Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, led a six-candidate primary Nov. 7 by 691 votes over <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>. `` Black Seat in Jeopardy'' was the front-page headline in The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, a black-oriented weekly newspaper. <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> was supported by some Hispanic leaders who said it was important symbolically to have at least one black on the commission. <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>, a former police officer who served two terms on the commission before losing the 1987 election, ran a slashing campaign that linked <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> with a drug trafficker and called him the worst commissioner in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> history. In his fiery years on the commission, <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON> often brought his anti-Communism into commission debates. Some key Cuban-American leaders had backed Cuban-born attorney <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurre </PERSON> in his 1987 defeat of <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>. Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, easily re-elected last week to a new four year-term, called <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON> disruptive and supported <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurre </PERSON> and `` Anglo'' J.L. <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> will be up for re-election in two years. The mayor also sits on the commission. Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> charged Ms. <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> with `` a penchant for demagoguery.'' Her commercials called Ms. <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> `` an opportunist who does not respect the law,'' a reference to a 1988 court decision that knocked Ms. <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> off the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> commission ballot because of a residency violation. Ms. <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> populist, concentrated her campaign among Hispanic voters. She led the six-candidate primary by 235 votes. <PERSON> Athalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Range </PERSON>, who is black, was picked as interim commissioner after Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s resignation. She did not seek election to a full term. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s 104,232 registered voters for the nonpartisan races included 44,034 foreign-born Hispanics _ estimates of all Hispanics range to 50 percent _ 32,021 blacks and 28,199 non-Latin whites, or Anglos.

<HEAD>Crew Determined to Snag Their Retrieval Target</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 One of the astronauts who will fly a satellite retrieval mission at Christmastime said Tuesday that if the crew does n't snag the bus-size target it will mean a great loss to science as well as a blow to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prestige. `` If we do n't get LDEF back, there's absolutely no science from that mission,'' said <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Low </PERSON>. `` It's a completely passive satellite and no data has been transmitted to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. So it's a complete loss of that mission if we do n't get it back.'' <ORGANIZATION> LDEF </ORGANIZATION> is an 11-ton, 30-foot-long payload of experiments placed in orbit by another shuttle crew in 1984. It was to have been retrieved a year later, but schedule changes and the 1986 Challenger explosion delayed a rescue mission. Now, with <ORGANIZATION> LDEF </ORGANIZATION> expected to crash back into <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s atmosphere in February, a five-person crew is to fly the space shuttle <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> in pursuit of the huge satellite, with liftoff scheduled for Dec. 18. They will follow another holiday shuttle flight into space. A secret <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> mission to be flown by a five-man Discovery crew is scheduled to lift off Thanksgiving Eve, Nov. 22. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> announced the new date earlier Tuesday. The launch was delayed two days because of potential wiring problems in electronic control units on Discovery's solid fuel booster rockets. `` We hope that even though we'll be gone from our families and loved ones for Christmas, that we'll be able to bring back a great big Christmas present for all the scientists that are working on the LDEF,'' said astronaut <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandenstein </PERSON> who will command <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think it looks pretty bad for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to allow something like that to come in and re-enter,'' <PERSON> Low </PERSON> said. `` It's big enough and it's massive enough that there are pieces that would survive re-entry and you always take a chance of hitting something or doing some damage to something.'' He said that the chances of LDEF chunks hitting anything are very remote because it flies mostly over oceans, `` But I think it's poor form to let something like that come back. <PERSON> Brandenstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Low </PERSON> and their crewmates held a news conference and individual interviews Tuesday to discuss their 10-day mission that will have them orbiting the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on Christmas. The other <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> crew members are pilot <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetherbee </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivins </PERSON>. They will deploy a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> communications satellite before <PERSON> Brandenstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wetherbee </PERSON> begin a complex set of maneuvers to track down LDEF, which <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> is to grab on the fourth day of the flight by reaching out with a 60-foot robot arm, pulling it into the cargo bay. The satellite is crammed with 57 science, technology and materials experiments which more than 200 scientists have been waiting to examine for nearly six years. They mainly want to know how various materials have withstood the long exposure to the space environment, information that will help in designing permanent space stations and other long-term spacecraft such as those planned for a space-based missile defense system. `` The vehicle is invaluable to us,'' said the mission's flight director, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON>. `` Almost every material known has been sitting up there in space being bombarded by atomic oxygen and other space materials for six years.''

<TEXT>
 Czechs won a concession from their hard-line Communist leadership Tuesday, with the government saying they would no longer need exit visas to travel to the West. Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said his government regards `` tourism as the citizens' important right to get to know the world, gain experience and establish personal contacts.'' His announcement came five days after neighboring <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> threw open its borders to allow citizens to travel freely to the West for the first time in nearly three decades. Millions have taken advantage of the new freedom. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which have been at the forefront of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc reforms, also allow their citizens to travel freely to the West. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> did not say when the new regulations would take effect, but government sources insisting on anonymity said it would be Jan. 1. `` The processing of travel documents is being speeded up,'' <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament. `` For travel to non-Socialist countries and to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> exit visas will not be necessary.'' Czechoslovak citizens previously wishing to travel to the West had to obtain a passport and then apply for exit visas with <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> authorities. This process requires stamps of approval from local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> branches, employers and the army and takes up to 30 days. Under the new rules, those wishing to travel to the West still must apply for visas from the Western country they wish to visit. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> does not require visas from Czechoslovak citizens. The Yugoslav Adriatic coast is a favorite summer travel spot for Czechs. Travel to other East bloc countries is visa-free except for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>'s announcement. `` The people of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> have the same aspirations for freedom that others have, and I would expect we'd see further changes there, just as we have seen in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and in -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` So it's a very good and encouraging step.'' <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has been among the most resistant countries in the Soviet bloc to political reforms and has cracked down on dissent, but it has gradually allowed its citizens greater freedom to travel. In the past two years, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> has allowed thousands of Czechoslovaks to vacation in the West. In the summer months, cars with Czech license plates are a common sight on Austrian and West German highways. The number of visits by Czechoslovak citizens to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> increased last year by 30 percent over the previous year, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said. The government will take steps to remove unnecessary red tape to make travel easier, he said. `` Our aim is that <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> become a country for which travel and tourism represent not only a significant sum in the state budget, but also the satisfaction of its citizens,'' he said in the nationally televised speech. Two years ago <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> relaxed hard currency restrictions, permitting its 15.5 million citizens to keep foreign currency earmarked for travel abroad in their bank accounts and withdraw it without a special application. The move eased travel abroad. Czechoslovaks must prove they have the necessary hard currency for travel to the West, either in an account, or a guarantee for expenses from a host abroad. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> did not say anything about these currency stipulations and it was unclear whether they would continue to be in effect after the exit visa regulation is lifted. In July, the government further eased travel restrictions, recognizing required invitations from abroad from anyone living in the West including emigres who left the country illegally. Previously the invitations had to come from family. The government also lifted restrictions on Czechoslovaks wishing to emigrate abroad to join family members who left their country illegally. Despite the travel liberalizations, however, authorities often have prevented prominent dissidents from traveling by confiscating their passports.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> extolled the link between education and liberty as he signed a proclamation Tuesday making this American Education Week. `` We are here today not to flunk our system, but to earn a higher grade,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a ceremony that drew 150 educators and students to the White House. `` As a nation, we proclaim that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is serious about lifting the hope and the dreams of young Americans, serious about education and the future,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> displayed a `` Solidarnosc'' bracelet he was wearing as a gift from Polish labor leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, to whom he gave the Presidential Medal of Freedom Monday night. `` This concern with education is to be found wherever men and women seek to extend human liberty,'' said the president. He said he was `` deeply impressed by the changes that are underway in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the fervent commitment of the Polish people to make that change permanent through education.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also made a pitch for parents to be given `` the power to choose their children's schools,'' and for schools to be able to hire `` knowledgeable'' non-education majors as teachers. American Education Week, Nov. 12-18 this year, has been observed annually since 1921. It is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, 10 national education groups and the American Legion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was joined on stage by representatives of each group and several local students, who presented him with a bronze statue of children's hands holding the groups' `` Flag of Liberty and Learning.'' `` Look at that!

<TEXT>
 The three leaders of a radical Sinhalese group that has waged a violent campaign to overthrow the government were captured and killed this week, the government said Tuesday. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> also said six of the group's seven Politburo members have been killed <PERSON> Upatissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamanayake </PERSON>, second-in-command of the ultra-nationalist <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, was shot to death Monday night when he tried to escape, <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gamanayake </PERSON>, 36, was regarded as heir apparent to the front's founding leader, <PERSON> Rohana </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON>, who was reportedly killed Sunday along with his No 3 man. A former front leader predicted the group, formed 22 years ago, would disintegrate. The foreign minister said <PERSON> Gamanayake </PERSON> was captured on information provided by <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON> and was taking interrogators to a front hideout when he tried to jump out of the vehicle. Soldiers shot and killed him, <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON> was captured Sunday in the central <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION> hill district and brought to <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, where he was killed, <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> announced Monday. He said the front's third-in-command, H.B. <PERSON> Herath </PERSON>, was killed at the same time. The official said both were killed when <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON> was bringing authorities to the front's headquarters in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Herath </PERSON> pulled a pistol and shot at his colleague and that security forces then shot and killed both men. <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> refused to identify the one Politburo member who has not been killed, saying only that he is at large. The People's <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> began a terror campaign in August 1987 to protest the government's signing of an accord intended to end a war by Tamil rebels. The front said the accord granted too many concessions to Tamils, who comprise about 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. It accused the Sinhalese-controlled government of selling out its own people and threatened to kill all who supported the accord. More than 6,000 people have been killed the past years. The government initially blamed the front for most of the killings, but when charred bodies of young Sinhalese men started turning up along roadsides, officials said pro-government vigilante squads were slaying suspected front members. Human rights activists, opposition politicians and front supporters also accused government security forces of killing some suspected front supporters. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON>, a former front leader, predicted the front would disintegrate with the deaths of <LOCATION> Wijeweera </LOCATION> and his chief aides. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> was jailed after leading the front's unsuccessful uprising against the government in 1971. Released with other front members during a general pardon in 1977, he now edits an independent political magazine. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1967 by <PERSON> Wijeweera </PERSON>, an avowed Marxist. It tried to overthrow the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> in 1971, but the uprising was put down and at least 20,000 people killed. The front later dabbled in mainstream politics, then went underground before emerging again as a major force in 1987.

<HEAD>Hooded Former Drug Dealer Says Detroy Coca Crops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A convicted drug dealer, who says he has sent 30 to 40 former colleagues to prison since turning states evidence, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Tuesday the only effective way to combat cocaine trade is to destroy the Central American coca crop. `` Cut off the snake's head and the snake will die,'' said `` Mr. Witness,'' as he was addressed by a number of congressmen. Accompanied by a trio of federal marshals, the witness' identity was protected by a hood over his head and an electronic device that distorted his voice. `` Go after the crop or the chemicals that process the coca,'' he said. `` I do n't think anything else will do any good.'' He said stepped up enforcement efforts `` is forcing -LRB- cartel leaders -RRB- to move, it is forcing them to spend money, but it is not stopping them,'' though he said the `` common man'' in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> no longer supports them. He said there would be wide local support for destroying the coca crops in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and neighboring countries if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provided adequate economic support to reimburse the peasant growers who would lose their main source of income. The witness, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> native, said he got into the drug business as an outgrowth of arrangements he made to get his Colombian-born wife and her family into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally. He told the subcommittee on financial institutions supervision, regulation and insurance that he never personally laundered drug money and had little first hand knowledge that might help the panel draft new legislation to curb the conversion of illictly obtained money into legitimate accounts. Moreover, he disagreed with the assessment of several committee members that the most effective way to attack international drug cartels is to trace the money flow to them. Though the witness was miscast as an authority on the parts of drug law within the subcommittee's jurisdiction, the panel members eagerly peppered him with questions about the drug trade in general. He said he was among `` four-to-six'' major cocaine importers in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area before he was arrested in 1985. He has been in the federal witness protection program since being released from prison in 1987 and has testified in a number of trials. Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., the House Banking subcommittee chairman, introduced the mystery witnesses as a man who had smuggled 56 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> areas and said he has enough information to personally lead to the convictions of several major drug lords being sought for extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> said he plans to closely question <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents and other federal enforcement officials in subsequent hearings about the apparent ease with which drug dealers circumvent existing laws drafted to curb money laundering. `` Adherence to the letter of the law is not enough,'' said <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>. `` Bankers must take one step more, and actively seek to uncover the suspicious and shady transaction, and then report it.'' The mystery witness said he had been told by former associates who handled that end of the business that it was relatively easy to accomplish. `` The money launderers ... that was their speciality,'' he said, adding that the specialists would approach bankers `` wine and dine them and make them an offer.'' So far as taking cash to foreign banks, the witness said he sometimes did that himself and that the procedure was very simple. `` I'd put it in a suitcase, get on a plane and leave,'' he said. Would a death penalty have deterred him from dealing drugs? asked the subcommittee staff director. `` Yes I would say it would have,'' responded the witness after pausing for several seconds to stare through his mask at the ceiling high above. `` I would not have gotten into the business. I would run from them at the beginning.'' He had said earlier that once in, he had no choice. `` I tried on several occasions -LRB- to retire -RRB- and I was told the only way out was a cemetery or a jail,'' he said.

All of the recalled product carries the sell-by date 1-29-90 or Jan. 29 90'' stamped on the package. The product is sold exclusively to grocery stores. No other product made by the firm has been involved. Food contaminated by the bacterium can call listeriosis, a `` rare but potentially fatal disease,'' the agency said. `` In general, healthy people are at little risk from listeriosis; most vulnerable are those with weakened immune systems _ infants, pregnant women, the elderly and the chronically ill.'' Consumers with questions about the recall can phone the agency's toll-free hotline at 1-800-535-4555 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST, Monday through Callers in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> metropolitan area should call 447-3333.

 Holiday turkeys will cost less but hams will be more expensive, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` Consumers will find adequate supplies of turkey and ham for the holiday season,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` Prices likely will be lower for turkeys but higher for hams than last year.'' <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> production in the fourth quarter may be up about 12 percent from a year ago, with frozen inventories up slightly. Ham supplies are expected to decline slightly despite an increase in cold storage stocks. `` Total red meat and poultry production is expected to set a record in 1989 and again in 1990,'' the report said. `` Among the major components, only beef production may decline in 1989, reflecting the reduced cattle inventory.'' Looking to 1990, the report said beef production may increase somewhat because of more cattle going into feedlots before slaughter, resulting in more `` fed'' beef. `` In both years, pork output could remain relatively large,'' the report said. `` Broiler output will continue to grow'' because of improved profits in recent years. `` <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> production also is expected to grow but at a lower rate than broilers because returns are being squeezed.''

 A liquor distributor and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> models are using a shimmering gold mesh dress to get the well-heeled to give money to those who can barely afford their next meal, much less a pair of shoes. Wednesday's fashion show will benefit the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless, a statewide group that does everything from lobby for the homeless to refinish furniture for people moving out of shelters. The coalition says between 5,000 and 8,000 people inhabit <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s streets and shelters. After the benefit, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Roux </PERSON>, the president of the company that distributes <ORGANIZATION> Absolut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vodka </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the golden dress, plans to take the $ 532,000 garment on the road for similar fund-raisers. `` I do n't think we have to look at it from the angle of gold,'' <PERSON> Roux </PERSON> said. `` I think we have to look at it from the angle of the novelty, the uniqueness of the dress, which will certainly bring attention to the cause.'' Model <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> will be draped in the 8-pound, 18-karat gold dress designed by <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> during the show at a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> nightclub. The Models for <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless hope to raise $ 40,000 from the show, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, a spokesman for the event. The group will give 100 percent of the proceeds to homeless causes, <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said, adding that Absolut and the models' organization will cover costs of the evening <PERSON> Roux </PERSON> got the idea of featuring the dress, a clingy short tank, after he spotted <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> wearing a gold mesh scarf. <PERSON> Ferrara </PERSON> designs for such stars as <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> and Barbra Streisand. <PERSON> Roux </PERSON> keeps the dress in a safe. `` You roll it in paper and keep it like you keep any jewelry,'' he said. The show also features a warmup act: a sterling silver dress valued at $ 100,000, also owned by Absolut. Fund-raisers say they recognize that the glitz and glamour of a fashion show seems at odds with the hard reality of homelessness. But <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON>, a model who helped create the idea three years ago, said people in the fashion industry have an obligation to contribute to the cause. `` It looks a little strange from the outside but it really makes sense. Everybody should get involved,'' said <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON>, who has done volunteer work at local homeless shelters. `` We make money off of people who are well-dressed.'' Meryl Langbort, of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Coalition for the Homeless, said her group welcomes the chance to reach people who might not otherwise think about the homeless. `` Certainly the money is important. Certainly we need it to operate. But what's so important about something like this is it gets the message out there,'' she said. Admission is $ 40, which pays for food but not drinks. The mesh for the dress was made by a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> firm that specializes in metal wear for less fashionable garb: outerwear for meatpackers. <ORGANIZATION> Whiting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> makes a stainless steel ring mesh that protects workers from knife wounds. Earlier in the century, the company, which started out as a jewelry firm, created a line of small gold mesh handbags.

<TEXT>
 Premier-designate <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> began parliamentary consultations to form a new government Tuesday, and some Christian lawmakers appeared willing to defy Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and work with the Moslem leader. Rival Shiite Moslem militiamen clashed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums. Three militiamen were reported wounded. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the Christian army leader, told reporters any national unity government would be a `` crime against <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s sovereignty, and anyone taking part in it will be a criminal.'' Nevertheless, four <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> deputies held a meeting to consider an offer from <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> to join his government, which will institute reforms intended to end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. They included <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest political force in the Christian enclave controlled by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops. `` The general was n't able to push a single Syrian soldier an inch backward in his so-called liberation war,'' said deputy <PERSON> Butros </PERSON> <PERSON> Harb </PERSON>, another who participated in the meeting. `` Why does n't the general give peace a chance?'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> in March declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive the 40,000 Syrian troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where they were deployed in 1976 under a mandate to quell the civil war. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said they abrogated the mandate by siding with the Moslems. The violence ended with an Arab League-brokered cease-fire in September, and last month, Lebanese legislators meeting in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, approved a peace accord clearing the way for election of a president and creation of a national reconciliation government. Newly elected president <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> on Monday named <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> prime minister to form the government. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> remains prime minister-designate until he forms a government endorsed by presidential decree. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has said any <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> politicians who join <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' government will be banned from the Christian enclave He pledged to block implementation of the peace accord because it does not include a timetable for the withdrawal of Syrian troops. <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON> has challenged <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to a televised debate over the accord. At his news conference, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected the proposed debate, saying, `` There is no need for any dialogue over the Taif accord. I shall not allow it to pass.'' No civilian casualties were reported from the one-hour flare-up between the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the Syrian-backed Amal militias. But <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said three combatants from both sides were wounded. The two factions have long been vying for control of the 1.2 million Shiites, who make up the largest sect among <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 4 million people. An <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the command of a Syrian army contingent in charge of the security of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem sector intervened with the leaderships of the two groups to stop the violence.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, out of concern over a string of accidents in recent weeks, has ordered that all normal operations cease for 48 hours while safety procedures are reviewed, the service announced today. `` <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and the Chief of Naval Operations <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> have ordered a Navy-wide 48-hour safety stand-down to be conducted within the next 72 hours,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement.

 The moment was solemn, but not so much so that <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, a twinkle in his eye, could not make a joke _ one especially appreciated by the beefiest of the labor leaders in his audience. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, addressing the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, recalled dark days when as a shipyard electrician he organized the strike that would lead, nine years later, to the first non-communist government in the Soviet bloc. `` When in August 1980, I jumped over the wall surrounding the <ORGANIZATION> Gdansk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>, I did not know what our protests would lead to, but I knew perfectly well what it was that we had to do,'' he said. Now, he said, he wished that only such `` clear-cut situations'' confronted him. And with a self-effacing grin, he took note of the pot belly that had come with the years. `` Maybe today,'' he said, `` I would have slightly more difficulty jumping over that wall ...'' Many a hefty union leader laughed with him. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> gave a bearhug to `` Brother Kirkland'' _ <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, president of the federation _ and a morale-boosting salute Tuesday to a labor movement that has seen its own role diminish and has had no recent success to emulate what <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had achieved in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. When he made his way through the hotel ballroom, grasping at hands, beaming with pleasure, the union chiefs cheered for 15 minutes. `` Lech, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON>,'' a Teamster chanted. Garment workers jumped on chairs to snap his picture; steelworkers raised their hands in the V-sign; <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s fellow electricians clapped in unison; a paperworker wearing a `` Solidarnosc'' button held aloft a red sign that, in Polish, denounced <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, president of strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. He V-signed them back and bowed at them, beaming. Pink-cheeked, his famous mustache trimmed and gray, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he did not want to appear to be currying their favor but he thanked the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> over and over for standing beside `` the cause so many people considered lost and which now, thanks to the stubbornness of Poles and the perseverance of our friends, has put us on the road to victory.'' In martial-law <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, in the days when <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was often under arrest, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> quietly delivered millions of dollars to his underground movement and smuggled in printing presses to let Solidarity's voice be heard. `` You have proven to be our most steadfast allies in the trade union struggle for human rights,'' he said. `` A vast movement for democracy and freedom is developing in my country. It is changing the political face of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and of the world. And that movement has been made possible only through the peaceful struggle of working people, of trade unionists like you and me, like us.''

<HEAD>Number Of Farm Workers Up Slightly From Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of workers employed by farmers showed a seasonal decline in October but was up slightly from a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. A quarterly report said the hired work force on farms was estimated at 983,000 during the week of Oct. 8-14, down from 1,197,000 in July. A year ago in October the work force was 976,000. Those did not include 308,000 `` agricultural service'' workers provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. In July, those totaled 351,000 workers, and in October 1988 they were estimated at 274,000. Dry weather throughout most of the nation during the farm labor survey week allowed corn and other row crop harvests to make good progress, the report said. The report said the national figures for hired workers had a sampling error of 3.5 percent. Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was $ 5.42 per hour, up from $ 5.23 in July and $ 5.18 a year ago, the report said. For workers hired by contractors, there was no national wage rate available, However, workers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were reported at $ 6.41 per hour, compared with $ 5.80 in July and $ 6.16 a year earlier in October 1988. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> workers averaged $ 5.15 per hour, compared with $ 5.55 in July and $ 4.98 a year earlier.

 If it's true that the appearance of a house says a lot about its inhabitants, then city officials believe <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Zysk </PERSON>'s house says too much. Zysk, 73, has plastered the front of his two-story home with about 50 hand-painted, wooden signs expressing his opinions on city issues ranging from traffic to taxes. City officials want the signs taken down. `` I'll go to jail, but I'm not taking them down,'' <PERSON> Zysk </PERSON> said, adding that the city is trying to stifle his freedom of speech. Most of the 2-foot-by-3-foot signs complain about the city's leadership and specific projects, like the proposed expansion of the local airport `` Whenever I thought something was unfair, I tried to let the people riding by know it,'' said <PERSON> Zysk </PERSON>, who also is known for expressing his dissatisfaction at <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meetings and in letters to the editor. Most of the signs went up during the last year. `` Clean out <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> _ sweep out dictators Nov. 7,'' reads one of his crudely produced pre-election signs that remain up. Last Wednesday, one day after voters elected a new mayor for the first time in eight years, city officials decided they'd seen enough. He was notified he was in violation of the city's sign ordinance and given until Monday to remove the signs. Because he has n't complied, officials said Tuesday they intend to take action `` You can put a ` For Sale' sign in front of your house, and we certainly would n't take issue with that or a decorative sign or one with a pleasant message,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, a building inspector with the city's department of environmental and transportation services. `` But one of his signs has a revolver on it and says ` Do n't beware of the dog; <ORGANIZATION> Beware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION>,' and they've gotten progressively worse,'' <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> said of a drawing on one sign Violation of the ordinance is a misdemeanor with the penalty set by a district court, city officials said. The case has gone to the city attorney, though no decision about prosecution has been made. <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> said the city has received several complaints about <PERSON> Zysk </PERSON>'s signs, primarily from passing motorists on the well-traveled residential street But a neighbor does n't seem to mind. `` I'm a firm believer in live and let live as long as he does n't hurt anybody,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Boes </PERSON>, who lives next door `` He's a good neighbor and he's good to me and does n't bother me a bit.''

<HEAD>Public Broadcasting Moves To Centralize Programming</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The three national public television organizations announced Tuesday an agreement designed to enhance their coordination and improve program scheduling and quality. The pact, involving the <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION>, will `` free public television from many of the frustrations of the past and give it a jump start for the next decade,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> CPB </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledwig </PERSON>. The agreement in principle, which now must be approved by the organizations' respective boards as well as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, would make <ORGANIZATION> CPB </ORGANIZATION> primarily responsible for developing new programs, while <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> would focus on distribution, funding for existing programs, and support of local stations. Public television in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is now a complex, decentralized system with multiple sources of programming and financing. As a consequence, producers spend much of their time scrambling for money, and development of a national program schedule is, at best, difficult. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in the Public Telecommunications Act of 1988, directed <ORGANIZATION> CPB </ORGANIZATION> and PBS to examine whether they could pool their resources with those of local public television stations to improve national programming. The agreement announced Tuesday is the outgrowth of that mandate. PBS President <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> called the tentative, three-year agreement `` both a centralization and a consensus-building plan. As a result, it will make the programming process more agile and responsive to a quickly changing television environment.'' Currently, about $ 262 million _ less than half of which is tax money _ is spent annually by public television for national programming. The agreement calls for <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> to directly manage $ 100 million of that amount. The <ORGANIZATION> CPB </ORGANIZATION> would handle the rest, concentrating on the development of new programs, financing of the new <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, and minority productions. PBS will expand the powers of its new program executive, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, under the agreement. She will be charged with developing a multiyear schedule and financing plan, in coordination with a new 17-member program policy committee drawing together representatives of producers, minorities and stations in each region of the country. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brugger </PERSON>, president of the stations' association, said the deal `` gives public television the opportunity to move forward in developing the strongest possible national programming with the funds available.''

 The Nielsen ratings for last week looked like a replay of the week before as <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> led the way with six of its half-hour comedies at the top. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show'' was first and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne'' was again in fourth place. Every show in the Top 10 was a regular series. Eight were repeaters from last week. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> took a commanding lead in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings for the week ended Nov. 12 with an average of 15.4. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was second with 12.7 and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was third with 11.8. A rating is the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million homes tuned to a show. The Top 10 were: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Different World,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Golden Girls,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Dear John'' and `` Empty Nest'' tied, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 60 Minutes,'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Unsolved Mysteries'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Wonder Years'' tied. CBS' `` Murder, She Wrote,'' eighth last week, fell to 15th place. The highest-rated special of the week was the first part of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Small Sacrifices,'' in which <PERSON> Farrah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawcett </PERSON> played a woman convicted of killing one of her own children. It tied for 12th place with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Monday Night Football and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Who's the Boss?'' The final chapter of `` Small Sacrifices'' was to be broadcast Tuesday night. Among the shows it pre-empted was `` Chicken Soup,'' which had its final showing last week and tied for 21st place with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>.'' It will be replaced next week by the return of `` Coach.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Manhunt: The Search for the Night Stalker,'' which went head-to-head against <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Small Sacrifices'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` The Return of <PERSON> McCloud </PERSON>,'' was 20th. `` McCloud'' tied for 39th place with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Family Matters.'' <PERSON> Jaclyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s premiere in `` <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>'' in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Saturday Mystery Movie was 43rd. It's the last element in the series. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> also is doing very well in the November sweeps. Month-long sweeps occur three times a year and result in vicious competition between networks. Advertising rates are based on the audience levels recorded during the periods. The ratings for the first 11 days of the Nielsen sweeps period: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 15.2, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 12.2, tied. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' remained ahead in the ratings for the evening news shows. On Thursday, when the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall was opened, the ratings were <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 12.0, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> 10.3, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> 10.1. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> was the only anchorman at the wall that day.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met Tuesday with four Republican members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who support abortion rights, but his spokesman said his own anti-abortion views `` are not subject to change.'' The president met with Reps. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also plans to speak at fund-raising event next Monday for both <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>. `` Abortion is not a test of support ... no matter what one's position is,'' spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` The president supports all Republicans,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` He supports Republican candidates without regard to specific positions that differ from him.'' Afterward, <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> said she and the other participants expressed their views but gained no commitment from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> said the Republicans did not expect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reverse himself on abortion, but hoped `` there could be some gradations in his position'' in the future _ such as allowing federally funded abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest. `` We certainly mentioned the fact we were concerned about thhe more than one million items are displayed at the Museum of the American Indian in upper <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, N.Y. The bulk of the collection is stored in a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, warehouse. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Force </PERSON>, director of the Museum of the American Indian, called the vote `` something we can all rejoice in.'' `` It's important to Indians, it's important to the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>, and it's important to this nation, and how can you do anything better than that?'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Nighthorse </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, D-Colo., the bill's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sponsor, said he hoped groundbreaking in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> could occur by 1992, a date he called meaningful because it would be the 500th anniversary of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>' landfall in the New World <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> agreed that date was realistic. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> also said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would sign the bill Monday or Tuesday at a ceremony on the new museum's site, between the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Space Museum and the Capitol. The legislation transfers the <PERSON> Heye </PERSON> collection to the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>, which already has a significant collection of Indian artifacts. It authorizes $ 10 million in 1990 for the planning, design and construction of the national museum, and for the care and custody of the Heye collection. It also mandates that the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> establish a satellite Indian museum in the old <ORGANIZATION> Custom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and build storage space for the artifacts at its museum support center in <LOCATION> Suitland </LOCATION>, Md. The costs of building the new museum and the two other facilities have been estimated at $ 175 million. Converting the <ORGANIZATION> Custom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is expected to cost $ 24 million, with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state to pay one-third each. In addition, the legislation stipulates that the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>, where possible, return its collection of some 18,000 Indian remains and funerary objects to their original tribes for burial. The legislation authorizes more than $ 1.2 million in 1991 for the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> to inventory and repatriate the remains. Disposition of the remains had been the last obstacle to a successful bill. Compromise came in September, when <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> _ himself an anthropologist _ reversed the museum's long-held policy that the bones were necessary for study. Indians nationwide, seeking to bury their ancestors, heralded his decision as a watershed that will influence other museums.

<HEAD>New Techniques Needed for Food Safety in 1990s</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New packaging techniques coupled with consumer demands for fresh, chemical-free foods are challenging producers to develop better ways of ensuring safety and informing the public, food industry experts say. New safety measures and an up-front approach to consumers' concerns have to go hand in hand with the development of new products, according to officials who spoke on food safety issues of the 1990s at the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Dairy Expo, which began Saturday and ends Wednesday `` Consumers now want fresher foods,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Henning </PERSON>, director of quality assurance for suburban Skokie-based <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` They're not as anxious to have food with preservatives that in the past controlled organisms, so we're going to have to have other methods to ensure safety.'' The perceived health value of fresh and refrigerated products presents a dilemma to the food industry, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugunin </PERSON>, senior director of product technologies of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Whereas you can put something in a can and be sure that no microorganisms are going to grow in there for eternity, you ca n't do that with fresh and refrigerated products,'' <PERSON> Hugunin </PERSON> said And better methods of packaging foods create their own challenges. New packaging methods can prevent mold longer, leaving food looking wholesome even while it grows unnoticeable organisms that cause food poisoning, he said. In response, food manufacturers are increasingly using a system, developed in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space program, of analyzing the production process at each step from the raw material to a finished product, according to <PERSON> Henning </PERSON>. The method allows food producers to prevent problems before they occur, rather than testing food after it's been produced and _ if there is a problem _ tracing it back to find the source, he said. This step-by-step method is `` the best answer anybody's come up with yet'' to ensure food safety, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotchkiss </PERSON>, an associate professor of food chemistry and toxicology at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said during a telephone interview Tuesday. But consumers seem unaware that their demands for new, fresher foods are pushing the industry to deal with new problems involving contamination by microorganisms. Instead, <PERSON> Hotchkiss </PERSON> said, they are more concerned with food additives and pesticides, which are a smaller problem. `` The consumer, by any objective measure, does not have the same priorities as the scientific community on food safety,'' <PERSON> Hotchkiss </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hugunin </PERSON> said the food industry has to do a better job of educating the public about pesticides and additives, such as the chemical Alar, a suspected cancer-causing chemical. An early 1989 report on Alar-treated apples by the private <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> prompted an uproar over its use, although government and apple industry officials said the chemical is only used on a small percentage of apples and is not dangerous in the levels used. The apple industry was caught unprepared, <PERSON> Hugunin </PERSON> said. `` The information which was needed to respond to some of these claims ... was just spread out all over and there was no good way of pulling it all together quickly to respond to some of the statements that were made,'' <PERSON> Hugunin </PERSON> said. As food products continue to develop and safety techniques change, the industry has to educate consumers before concerns grow, he said. The expo is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockville </ORGANIZATION>, Md.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday criticized the leftist rebels of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for `` senseless bloodshed'' in the all-out offensive that has crippled the capital of the Central American nation. He also renewed a charge that the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is continuing to arm the Salvadoran guerrillas, the <ORGANIZATION> Faribundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. In remarks to ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> meeting here, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted to relay `` how upset I am that at a time when we're all trying to build peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> through diplomatic means, the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, aided and abetted by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government, has resorted to senseless bloodshed and gross violations of all the agreements reached to promote peace in Central America.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a pitch for the democracies that are members of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> to pressure <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to stop aiding the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. `` As democrats, we ought to be supporting the concept of stopping these weapons going in there,'' he said. The rebels mounted their largest offensive of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s 10-year civil war Saturday night, with the death count so far at 466 people as residents were trapped by combat and government aircraft struck at rebel positions Despite government denials, rebels clearly held parts of northern and eastern neighborhoods in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and a rebel communique said guerrillas had liberated parts of eight of the country's 14 provinces. In his remarks to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> luncheon, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted to assure the countries of the hemisphere that despite the ballyhoo over reform moves in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and his upcoming summit meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, he does n't want the Latin nations `` to think that beacause we're paying a lot of attention to the change that's taking place there, trying to figure out how we can facilitate the change, that that means a lack of interest in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>.'' `` I am delighted with the new moves toward democracy in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Despite the excitement, we're not going to neglect this hemisphere.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, which is suspending activities for 48 hours over the next three days to review safety, has experienced seven serious accidents in less than three weeks, the most recent being a fire Tuesday that injured at least 29 people. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the `` safety stand-down'' order requires every ship, squadron and shore training facility to interrupt normal operations and review basic safety and operating procedures. The order came about six hours after fire broke out on the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inchon </ORGANIZATION>, an amphibious assault ship undergoing maintenance at the shipyard in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said 20 sailors and nine civilians were injured and were taken to six hospitals. At least one victim was listed in serious condition. Since the run of mishaps started Oct. 29, nine people have been killed or lost at sea and at least 45 people have been injured. Between Jan. 1 and Nov. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> counted 101 `` operation and training related'' fatalities in the service, including 47 in the explosion aboard the USS Iowa on April 19. The most serious of the recent accidents occurred Oct. 29 when a jet pilot making his first landing on an aircraft carrier crashed into the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The pilot and four others on deck the ship were killed. There has been some debate over the accidents. Earlier in the month, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called the mishaps `` an extraordinary grouping of unrelated accidents. Others like <PERSON> Karlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, an industrial psychologist, warned that cutting training budgets can lead to accidents. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is always trying to cut training budgets ... It's a prescription for disaster,'' she said. Other incidents include: _ A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> reserve pilot flying a A-7E jet crashed Nov. 9 into an apartment complex in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, killing two civilians and injuring two others, including himself _ Three sailors and a reported $ 4 million worth of non-nuclear missiles were swept by a wave from the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> on Nov. 1 One sailor was presumed dead. _ Nine sailors were treated for burns or smoke inhalation when fire erupted in the boiler aboard the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION>, some 500 miles west of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> on Nov. 1 _ A F @ A-18 pilot dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided missile cruiser USS Reeves in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, causing minor injuries to five sailors and blowing a five-foot hole in the ship's bow on Oct. 30 _ A sailor aboard the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vinson </ORGANIZATION> fell into the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> about 620 miles north of <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Oct. 30 and was presumed lost

 Federal officials are considering an interim appointment at the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> while they search for a permanent commissioner to replace <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> who has resigned, sources said Tuesday. Unlike the current and previous <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> commissioners who were appointed by the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, the next commissioner will be a presidential appointment and will require <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. The change in procedure means it likely will to take longer to put a permanent commissioner at the helm of the agency whose responsibility is to assure the safety of drugs, cosmetics and most food products. The pace of presidential appointments during the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has been slow. At <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>, several key agencies still have no permanent head, including the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has been plagued recently by disclosures of bribery and corruption in approval of generic drugs, and some lawmakers on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> have said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s leaving may delay needed reforms at the agency. Young will end more than five years as commissioner on Dec. 18 and become a deputy assistant secretary of health in charge of science and environmental matters. Both jobs are in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which is part of HHS. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year changed the law last year pertaining to the appointment of an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> commissioner to require <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation, as is required of other top jobs in the administration. `` It's a very important job and touches so much of the consumer safety questions. It's important that someone like that to have a level of consideration that other appointments do,'' said a congressional aide who worked on the measure but spoke on the condition of anonymity. Sources in the department, who also spoke on the condition their names not be used, said that because of the time it may take to select a permanent commissioner and gain approval, officials are considering an interim appointment. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> is currently the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s second in command as acting deputy commissioner. Names being mentioned as early candidates for the permanent post include <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who is President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s personal physician, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinco </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer and former <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> official.

The president left open the possibility he will stop in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to brief <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies after his shipboard summit in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Dec. 2 and 3. `` We're thinking right now how we might stay in touch with our allies,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his remarks in response to the announcement that <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, one of the last hard-line <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> nations, no longer will require its citizens to obtain exit visas to travel outside their country. No date for the change was given in the Czech announcement. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> talks about a common home,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We talk about a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> whole and free. And it's a most exciting time.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke about Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> during several appearances during the day. `` I am delighted with the new moves towards democracy in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. We're all caught up in this,'' he told foreign ministers from the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>. During a meeting with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he will press <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> next month to halt the shipment of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc arms to the leftist government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. In preparation for the summit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his national security adviser, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, had dinner Monday night with former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, who has expressed fears that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will try to enlist the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` as a partner with him in the division of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' Separately, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters that his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, will not accompany him to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is being pressured by Democrats to respond more strongly to the changes sweeping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, dramatized last week by the opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and the promise of greater democracy in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. To comment on the announcement from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> broke his own rule against answering questions from reporters during photo-taking sessions. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said it was regrettable that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, through his spokesman, had rejected the idea of going to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to express <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> satisfaction with the `` symbolic destruction'' of the wall or to normalize trade relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` While the president has rejected all of these, he has reversed himself on issues before and I hold out out hope he will do so again,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. On Monday, the majority leader had urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to travel to the Berlin Wall, convene a meeting of the Western allies and suspend trade restrictions against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The White House said it was highly unlikely <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would go to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. White House officials said the low-keyed approach taken by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was intended to lend support and encouragement to developments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> while guarding against doing anything that might provoke a crackdown or slow the pace of reforms. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, responding to questions during an Oval Office meeting with Tunisian President <PERSON> Zine </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Abidine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, said he was pleased by the easing of travel restrictions in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, calling it `` a very encouraging first step.'' He said, `` Several months ago we called for a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> whole and free, and as I survey the changes taking place, it seems to be moving towards a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> whole and free.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` The people of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> have the same aspirations for freedom that others have. And I would expect we'd see further changes there, just as we have seen in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and in -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- `` So it's a very good and encouraging step,'' he added. `` And this is further manifestation that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> some day will be whole and free.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> signaled its approval of a $ 738 million aid package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> that is nearing approval in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're generally supportive,'' spokesman <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We'd like to give billions if we had them. Asked if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would like to see free elections in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We would like to see the people's rights and wills determined by themselves, and we think there is a very constructive course of freedom under way in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the other parts of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> praised the lifting of travel restrictions in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and added, `` We're not surprised by anything anymore.''

 West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> concluded a historic visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> Tuesday and told his hosts the issue of German reunification concerns all of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and must be approached with great sensitivity. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> spoke at a news conference after signing a joint declaration with the Solidarity-led government. The declaration opens the way to close economic cooperation and repeats previous West German commitments to respect <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s western border. Also Tuesday, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> paid a somber visit to the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp, where 4 million people were murdered by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> during World War II. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was accompanied by <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, and Rabbi <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Joskowicz </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s only rabbi. Polish television broadcast part of the visit live to the somber music of <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> laid a wreath at the wall of death, where prisoners of different nationalities were shot, and another in <LOCATION> Birkenau </LOCATION> where the crematoriums were located. He did not make a speech. It was the second site <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> visited in connection with World War II. On Sunday, he embraced Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> in a sign of reonciliation at a Mass in the former German village of <LOCATION> Krzyzowa </LOCATION>, where opponents to <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> planned reisistance during the war. The chancellor's five-day visit here was aimed at cementing cooperation between the two countries but was dominated by the rapid changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> found the question of German reunification foremost in the minds of his hosts when he returned to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Saturday after making a brief stop in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> for an emergency Cabinet meeting. `` Both the Germans in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are not alone,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said at Tuesday's news conference. `` We Germans have to act with a great dose of sensitivity as far as the situation in all of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is concerned.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, the first West German leader to visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since 1977, said he and <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> discussed bilateral relations `` in the historical context and in the context of obligations for the future.'' The statement said the two countries aim to `` heal the wounds of the past through understanding and reconciliation.'' In a meeting with members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Monday, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would benefit from a unified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> pledged in a 1970 treaty to respect the <PERSON> Oder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neisse </PERSON> rivers as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s western borders, but a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is not committed to those terms. The joint declaration signed Tuesday says <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will continue to honor the 1970 treaty. Polish government spokeswoman <PERSON> Malgorzata </PERSON> <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was satisfied with the section of the treaty on borders. Both <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said the joint declaration and 11 agreements signed earlier form the basis of a new chapter in German-Polish relations. Of major importance to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are clauses in which <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> says it will strive to ensure that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s $ 39-billion debt is rescheduled `` under a long-term arrangement on terms that take ... account of the country's ability to pay.'' A senior West German official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> favored at least a five-year moratorium on repayment of interest. The declaration calls for intensified economic cooperation between the two countries. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s largest western trading partner. It also calls for an increase in exchanges between young people, the establishment of German cultural institutions in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the expansion of German-language teaching.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday that he will press in next month's meeting with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for an end to the shipment of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the comment at the outset of a meeting with the observer team he named to monitor the February elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it has called in from retirement <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shlaudeman </PERSON>, a diplomat with long years of experience on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to give advice and monitor talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> between the Nicaraguan government and the Contra rebels. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked what the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can do for peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` What the Soviets can do is help facilitate free elections by stopping to send arms into this hemisphere and support for the one country that seems to be swimming against the tide,'' he said. This was a reference to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> view that Soviet-manufactured arms are abetting both the leftist government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` I expect I'll have a chance at the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> meeting'' with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` to elaborate on that in a little bit more detail,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Separately, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> meeting here `` how upset I am that at a time when we're all trying to build peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> through diplomatic means, the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- guerrilla movement -RRB- in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, aided and abetted by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government, has resorted to senseless bloodshed and gross violations of all the agreements reached to promote peace in Central America.'' <PERSON> Shlaudeman </PERSON>, 63, has agreed to work as a consultant to the department on the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> talks but <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said he will not participate directly in the discussions nor have substantive contact with Sandinista officials. Nonetheless, a senior official said <PERSON> Shlaudeman </PERSON> did have a half-hour meeting in recent days with Sandinista diplomats at their request. `` He was in a listening capacity,'' said the official, asking not to be identified. <PERSON> Shlaudeman </PERSON> ended his 35-year diplomatic career last May after a tour as ambassador to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. He assumed his consultant's duties last month. The talks between the Sandinistas and the Contras began at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Thursday and were moved here Monday. Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> called off a 19-month old cease-fire with the rebels Nov. 1 and simultaneously proposed the first direct discussions between the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION> and the resistance since June 1988. The main Sandinista objective is the demobilization of the Contras, consistent with a communique issued by the Central American presidents last August. The rebels, meanwhile, are stressing the need to restore the cease-fire. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said a new proposal was on the table at the talks Tuesday with `` some common points of agreement.'' She had no further details. <PERSON> Shlaudeman </PERSON> was the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator for bilateral discussions between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for an eight-month period starting in June 1984. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration broke off the talks, contending that the Sandinista side was not negotiating in good faith. There have been no substantive discussions between the two countries since January 1985, and Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said that policy is unchanged. <PERSON> Shlaudeman </PERSON>'s principal contact with the Nicaraguan government during the 1984-85 period was Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, who is leading the Sandinista delegation to the talks with the Contras. <PERSON> Shlaudeman </PERSON> also was a special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, making frequent trips to the region at the time when the now-defunct Contadora peace process was under way. The Presidential Monitoring Commission will be chaired by Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., and Rep. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilenson </PERSON>, D-Calif., White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> The lawmakers will make numerous visits to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> over the next 3 -LCB- months to monitor the election preparations and the balloting itself, where opposition candidate <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> is seeking to unseat <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the lawmakers, in small groups, will make 15 trips to the Central American country between now and Feb. 25. Joining <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beilenson </PERSON> on the president's observer panel are Sens. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn.; <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan.; <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt.; <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, D-Nev.

<HEAD>Labor Federation Vows National Health Care Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday vowed an aggressive campaign for passage of a national health care plan and Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> promised that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would adopt one next year. Delegates to the labor federation's convention endorsed a resolution calling for an intensive lobbying campaign as well as efforts to convince employers to join with unions in the effort. Labor in the past has endorsed Kennedy-sponsored proposals to require private employers to provide private health insurance to workers but a leader of the new campaign said the 14-million member federation was entering the lobbying effort with an open mind. `` We are most interested in forging a consensus that we must as a nation find a solution that ensures universal access to quality care at a price we can afford,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> said the campaign, to be formally announced Wednesday, would include meetings `` of hundreds of rank and file'' with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in their home districts. He said rising health care costs have limited worker pay increases because rising premiums have squeezed company profits and also because employer efforts to shift insurance costs to workers have dominated contract talks. To demonstrate its commitment to the campaign, several presidents of the federation's largest unions spoke in favor of the plan. `` Let us leave this convention commited to mobilizing the roughly 90 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens who are unhappy with our current system,'' said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON>. `` This is an issue whose time has come and an issue on which the labor movement must provide leadership.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, said the rising costs were due to the `` insatiable greed'' of health care providers. The resolution calling for the health-care campaign was passed on an afternoon dedicated the family-related issues and speeches from two of labor staunchest allies in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON>, D-Md. Earlier in the day the convention heard an emotional speech from Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who thanked American unions for their support of the Polish trade union he leads. Also endorsed were pending congressional bills to increase federal funds for day care and to require parental leave to care for newborn and ill children. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., told the 800 delegates <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would endorse a national health care plan in 1990 `` The <LOCATION> Ameican </LOCATION> people understand the need,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` Politicians are stating to understand. Progressive businesses are beginning to understand. And by the time you finish the national health care campaign you ared launching at this convention, President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will catch on too, and have no choice but to sign this bill we intend to sent to him in 1990.''

 Outlawed flags lined the streets of <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> and Palestinians throughout the occupied lands planned marches and fireworks Wednesday to mark the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declaration of independence one year ago. Activists in <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zeit </LOCATION> said they would observe the anniversary by reading the Palestinian independence proclamation over a mosque loudspeaker and marching military-style under the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has outlawed. The army closed schools in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, arrested alleged agitators in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> raids and called in reinforcements to help quell anticipated riots. Soldiers sealed off the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, searching for Palestinian gunmen who killed an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier Monday evening and wounded another. The Moslem fundamentalist group <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, or Zeal, claimed responsibility for the attack. Late Tuesday, a Palestinian was shot by soldiers and later died from a chest wound at <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, doctors said. The body was snatched from the hospital, apparently by relatives, they said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio identified the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Odah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyad </PERSON>, 18, from the <LOCATION> Kalandia </LOCATION> refugee camp five miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The army confirmed the death but said it was checking to see if soldiers were involved. Also in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Manweh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakry </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, died of chest wounds suffered in a Sept. 14 clash with troops. The deaths raised to 615 the number of Palestinians killed by soldiers or civilians in the 23-month-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Forty-one Israelis have also died in the violence. At least 16 Palestinians were wounded in stone-throwing clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops throughout the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> Tuesday, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sources said. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the attack on the soldiers could signal plans to increase the use of guns and explosives. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has urged its followers repeatedly not to use firearms, recommending non-violent protest and civil disobedience instead. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> began a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he will meet with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on proposals for peace talks with Palestinians. <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags of black, white, green and red hung from telephone poles and power lines throughout the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. Pictures of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> were pasted on buildings. Children in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> handed out flowers and balloons in the flag colors. Arab motorists honked their horns and flicked on lights as they drove down <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukhtar </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON>, the main throroughfare, witnesses reported. Firework rockets streaked across the sky in the early evening, leaving red and blue trails. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> warned Palestinians against taking part in the festivities, declaring on army radio: `` Be it the unfurling of a flag, or the throwing of a stone or illegal gatherings, all steps will be taken against these things.'' In <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION>, a town of 3,000 people, flags and pictures adorned lamp posts, telephone poles and even the top of a cross on the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, Our Lady of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON>, a 26-year-old activist who would not give his last name, said women's committes planned to dance the `` dabka,'' a traditional Palestinian folk dance, in the streets on the anniversary of the independence declaration Nov. 15, 1988, at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. Students from <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which the army closed early in the uprising, posted an invitation in a coffee shop to a `` Photography exhibit on the Palestinian state.'' `` Despite the pain of so many dead and wounded, this is a moment of joy,'' said <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` It shows that we can change and lead our own history.'' `` How can I celebrate with so many people killed and wounded?'' said a gasoline station attendant, who would not give his name. `` People will try to celebrate, but I think the army will suppress them.'' In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> security sweep, soldiers detained 58 Palestinians suspected of uprising activities, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. On Monday evening, Palestinians fired 28 shots at an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> patrol jeep, killing Cpl. <PERSON> Sarul </PERSON> <PERSON> Trechtenboit </PERSON>, 42, and critically wounding another soldier, an army spokesman reported. Trechtenboit, who leaves four children, was the first soldier killed in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987. Eight soldiers are among the 41 Israeli victims of the violence. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said an anonymous caller claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> policy of seeking a negotiated settlement with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> also has been blamed for the kidnap-murder of two soldiers who disappeared while hitchhiking earlier this year.

 <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> sees a world of possibility in french fries. They can curve sideways or spiral upward, taste like a potato or have the bite of sharp cheddar. In fact, the future of french fries is so bright they'll be coming every sort of way _ except with shades, says <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>, marketing director for the nation's largest potato processor. `` Customers will still buy the normal straight potatoes, but they've gotten a little bored with them,'' <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> said in an interview at the headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Lamb-Weston </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think that's why seasoning comes into play,'' he said. `` People are going to more unique cuts and more flavored potato products.'' <ORGANIZATION> Lamb-Weston </ORGANIZATION>, which supplies 30 percent of the nation's frozen potatoes, offers frozen tempura fries in curly or criss-cross shapes, potato skins, cheddar fries, spicy fries, oval potato slices and tiny baked potatoes. `` That's where the business is up,'' <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> said. Examples include the restaurant chain <ORGANIZATION> Arby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, which is selling a <ORGANIZATION> Lamb-Weston </ORGANIZATION> seasoned curly fry, he said. <PERSON> Hardee </PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Rax </ORGANIZATION> restaurants also offer potato options, and McDonald's is investigating an alternative potato, he said. Fast-food chains also are demanding low-cholesterol frying oils, such as canola oil, to keep health-conscious customers happy, <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> said. Competition from baked potatoes, potato chips and other spud products are threatening the market share of the venerable french fry in restaurants and grocery stores, industry officials say. `` The demand for fries is not declining but holding steady,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> of The Potato Board in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` But chips are going up, an average of 5 percent increase a year.'' The nation consumes about 5.5 billion pounds of frozen potatoes a year, and Ms. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said annual per capita consumption of potatoes is rising, from 115 pounds in 1980 to 123 pounds in 1987. The biggest change is that frozen potatoes are capturing more and more of the market as consumers become strapped for time. That benefits Northwest growers who send the bulk of their crop to processors. Consumers on average ate 74.6 pounds of processed potatoes and 47 pounds of fresh potatoes in 1987, Ms. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. That compared to 1980, when consumers ate 64 pounds of processed spuds and 51 pounds of fresh, she said. `` It's a lot easier to pick up frozen french fries than to make your own,'' she said. `` I do n't think we're raising a generation that can cook.''

 A Soviet official appealed on Tuesday for more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for Soviet participation in the organization that makes rules for world trade. `` When we send you our equipment, and you compare it with the same equipment from some other countries, the duties are two, five or 10 times more,'' said <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Khotsialov </PERSON> of the Soviet government's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is interested in selling machinery to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, pointing out that it sells machine tools and other equipment to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> duties on Soviet goods are high because the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 denies lower rates to countries that limit emigration. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could grant the lower rates, waiving the amendment and applying a familiar trade rule that would give the Soviets all the privileges of the `` most favored nation.'' He has said he first wants to see the Soviets enact a law that would confirm recent liberal Soviet policies on emigration. Any new arrangements would also need approval from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The Supreme Soviet is expected to pass an emigration law soon. <PERSON> Khotsialov </PERSON> said the Soviets need advice from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials and business people on how to work with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and the organization that administers it. The <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> organization, with headquarters in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, is sponsoring negotiations among more than 100 countries to set up new rules on trade, including for the first time trade in services and a reduction in the subsidies on farm trade that cost taxpayers billions of dollars every year. `` We are eager to be in <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Khotsialov </PERSON> said. `` That requires some some conditions on our side too, but in this case we need your support ... If you want us in the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, I think we will be in the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Khotsialov </PERSON> spoke on the eve of two days of talks between a Soviet mission headed by Foreign Economics Minister <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Katushev </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>. He addressed the East-West Forum, a private group that seeks to promote trade.

The bulk of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> consists in Soviet imports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, maize and soybeans. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s spokeswoman, said the two days of meetings will cover trade and investment questions, including the reduction of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tariffs on Soviet goods.

 The House on Tuesday approved a foreign aid bill that offers up to $ 85 million for <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>'s besieged military, but also contains so many competing demands for cash that the full amount may not be available. The compromise bill, which came up just a day before Polish labor leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was to address a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, also contained the first hard cash to back up a promised three-year <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid program for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The vote on the overall measure was 324 to 93. One contentious issue in the $ 14.6 billion bill was defused when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted to give President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the right to withhold $ 15 million for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Population Fund if he finds the agency supports forced abortions or sterilizations in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But a veto threat against the bill remained over a prohibition on the use of foreign aid money to persuade other countries to carry out policies prohibited by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law. For <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, whose government is battling a fierce onslaught by leftist rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the bill would provide up to $ 85 million in military aid $ 12 million for police training and equipment. Because lawmakers larded the bill with dozens of provisions requiring that certain amounts go to various other countries and programs, it is unlikely there will be enough military aid money left to give the rightist government of <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> its full aid complement. For <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the bill included $ 293 million to fund the first year of the three-year program to encourage political and economic reform in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, along with $ 240 million in stand-by credit and trade insurance _ a total of $ 533 million. Major elements of the appropriations measure included a $ 200 million grant to help stabilize <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s battered economy and $ 45 million for a private enterprise development fund. Other money would go for environmental cleanup, agriculture and educational and cultural exchanges. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had threatened a veto on issues growing out of two highly political controversies: abortion and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's conduct during the Iran-Contra affair The bill had provided $ 15 million to support the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Population Fund, reversing a five-year ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to that agency. The aid was included in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by Sen. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON>, D-Md., who argued that it was time to resume help for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s family planning efforts `` What we're talking about here is the lives of women,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., noting that the average number of births per woman in <LOCATION> Sub-Saharan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is 6.5, and that pregnancy causes one in four deaths there among women aged 15 to 49 But opponents noted that the agency operates programs in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which has a one-child-per-family policy that allegedly has led to forced abortions and sterilizations. Anti-abortion forces sought to kill the provision, despite a stipulation in the bill that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> money not be used in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, couched the issue as one of coercive against voluntary family planning, andnoted that any money to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency would free funds to be used in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In a pair of apparently contradictory votes, opponents first failed on a vote of 244-178 to delete the money from the bill, then prevailed 219 to 203 when they sought to place conditions on the family planning aid. The motion which passed would let <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> withhold the funding if he determines that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency supports any program of coerced abortion or sterilization, and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said that would remove a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto threat on the issue. The remaining provision tempting a veto was a ban on the use of foreign aid money to `` leverage'' other countries that receive it into carrying out <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies that are contrary to the law. Documents released at the trial of Iran-Contra figure <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> showed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had expedited aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> as a reward for its harboring of the Contra rebels fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government. Overall, the measure included $ 4.7 billion in military aid and $ 3.2 billion in economic aid. Among major earmarks for countries in the bill were $ 3 billion for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and $ 2.1 billion for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, always the largest aid recipients because of their participation in the <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> David </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process. Other large recipients included <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, with $ 460 million in military and economic aid; <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, $ 500 million in military aid; <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, $ 350 million in military aid; $ 63 million in military and economic aid for <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>; and $ 125 million in military aid to help the countries of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> fight the war on drugs. In addition, the agreement provides $ 160 million for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contribution to the Multilateral Assistance Initiative for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, $ 83 million for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> relief, $ 83 million for <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and $ 30 million in military aid to countries in <LOCATION> Sub-Saharan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Support for Capital Gains Cut Short of Margin Needed to End Talkathon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> supported a capital-gains tax cut on a procedural vote Tuesday but the number fell short of the 60 needed to halt a Democratic filibuster against the reduction. The vote on limiting debate on the cut, which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed, was 51-47. Republicans will get another try to limit debate Wednesday. If that fails, the issue will be put to rest for the year. Leaders of both parties have said no reduction is likely this year. Tuesday's debate was set up to give backers of a capital-gains cut the chance to show their strength. `` This is a situation where everyone gains,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., contending that a tax cut would benefit investors while producing increased revenue for the government to spend on social programs `` You do n't get many deals better than that.'' Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, who has led opposition to a capital-gains cut, said that in the long term, the proposal would worsen the budget deficit by tens of billions of dollars. `` This amendment symbolizes the excesses of the last decade, especially the unprecedented irresponsibiity in federal fiscal policy. `` This is budget fraud that is astonishing in its audacity and irresponsiblity,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` This amendment is designed to do one thing ... only: Give President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a political victory no matter what the long-term cost to the American people.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned last year on a pledge to cut taxes on capital gains, which are profits from the sale of investments. He said a cut would spur investment and job creation. Democrats generally are opposed, arguing that 80 percent of the benefit of a reduction would go to those with incomes of more than $ 100,000 a year. The proposed reduction has been the dominant point of contention between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president this year. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, with significant Democratic support, approved a capital-gains cut in September. Before 1986, only 40 percent of capital gains from property owned more than one year was taxable. Since that time, capital gains have been fully taxable at the same rates applied to other income. <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>'s amendment also included a provision, written by Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Del., to create a new type of Individual Retirement Account that, at least for a few years, would help pay for the capital-gains cut Under the Republican amendment, the longer an asset was held, the less of the profit from its sale would be taxed. Thus, only 95 percent of the profit from the sale of an asset owned more than one year would be taxed. That percentage would increase by five points for each additional year up to seven; only 65 percent of the gain would be taxed when property owned more than seven years is sold. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> plan for expanding IRAs would use a different approach than was used by more than 15 million when deductible IRAs were open to all workers. The old-style <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, which now is restricted to lower-income workers and those not covered by a company pension, permits a tax deduction for the maximum $ 2,000-a-year contribution. The Packwood-Roth amendment would permit workers to set aside up to $ 2,000 a year but receive no tax deduction. Instead, interest on the account would never be taxed. In addition, penalty-free withdrawals could be made from the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> to pay medical or education expenses or for retirement. Workers would be permitted to to convert their current tax-deductible IRAs into the new accounts by paying tax on contributions that had been deducted in the past. <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> cited estimates that these `` rollovers'' would produce enough revenue for the government to pay for the cut in capital-gains taxes. The capital-gains cut passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> contained no changes in IRAs. Until 1992, it would exclude 30 percent of gains from taxation. After that, only the portion of gains attributable to inflation would be excluded.

Affective disorder is a psychiatric term referring to such problems as mood swings and depression. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' doctor has said she suffers from depression. <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the governor, said it was n't known how long Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would remain at Deaconess Asked if Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was being treated for a combination of depression and alcoholism, Ms. <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON> said: `` those are some of the issues relating to her treatment that Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is only discussing with her family and her doctors.'' <PERSON> Janna </PERSON> <PERSON> Crittendon </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Deaconess, said Tuesday that Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' condition was `` satisfactory.'' The affective disorders unit is a 27-bed section run by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> faculty, Ms. <PERSON> Crittendon </PERSON> said. It offers diagnosis and treatment of patients, she said. The average length of stay is 16 days. Symptoms of mood disorder include disturbed sleep and disrupted appetite and can leave the sufferer unable to concentrate on daily activities, Ms. <PERSON> Crittendon </PERSON> said. Such disorders can be associated with substance abuse, Ms. <PERSON> Crittendon </PERSON> said, adding that she was speaking generally and not about Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' case. Deaconess specializes in treating the more complex and chronic diseases, Ms. <PERSON> Crittendon </PERSON> said. It is known in particular for research and treatment of heart ailments, cancer and AIDS and as a venue for organ transplants, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was admitted to <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's on Nov. 6 after drinking a small amount of rubbing alcohol. The governor said Monday his wife had `` a slip,'' or a relapse back into drinking when she swallowed the rubbing alcohol. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was treated for alcoholism last March. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had earlier admitted to a long-term dependency on diet pills, for which she also has received treatment. Also on Tuesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' attorney on her book project, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, said the memoir was about 95 percent completed and needs a couple weeks more work. <ORGANIZATION> Publisher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster still plans to release the book next summer, he said. When Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is feeling able, she will finish the book with her collaborator, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Scovell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He would not discuss whether new material on her latest hospitalization would be included.

<BYLINE>Judge Swears in Multi-Racial Jury ^By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A multi-racial jury was sworn in Tuesday to hear the manslaughter case against a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police officer accused of shooting a black motorcyclist, sparking three days of rioting in January. Dade Circuit Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> dismissed last-minute defense appeals to move the trial from this racially divided city, and scheduled opening arguments for Wednesday. `` This case, your honor, has been surrounded by violence since the beginning,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> argued in seeking a change of venue. Prosecutor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiffrin </PERSON> countered by saying three weeks of intensive questioning had produced an impartial panel that would not be influenced by fears that their verdict could spark renewed rioting. The jury of two blacks, one Hispanic and three non-Hispanic whites will decide the case against <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, who fatally shot <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s passenger, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24, died of injuries suffered when the motorcycle crashed. The jury will be sequestered during the trial, which could last up to six weeks. Fears that an acquittal could set off new rioting were somewhat calmed by the presence of two blacks on the jury, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not so tense, people are just aware, watching,'' <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said. `` The fact that the jury resembles the tri-ethnic balance of this community goes a long way in reducing that level of tensions.'' The judge also brushed aside new defense attempts to unseat black juror <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>. A state appeals court ruled Monday that <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> rightfully seated the black union leader after finding the defense had challenged him solely on the basis of race. Black introduced new testimony from a private detective Tuesday attempting to show <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was unreliable in employment hearings, but the judge again refused to exclude the juror. Following Tuesday's hearing, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> complained that the judge's rulings in the case have `` already excluded 75 percent of our defense. In earlier pre-trial motions, <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> denied defense efforts to introduce <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s drug connections and police record. <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> also ruled that the prosecution can use testimony about <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> city police regulations in an attempt to show <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> acted negligently and unprofessionally when he shot and killed <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>. The defense, however, may bring up 5.5 grams of marijuana found on <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s body, as well as $ 1,500 cash he had in his pocket. They may also tell jurors that <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> had alcohol and high level of THC, marijauana's active ingredient, in his bloodstream. The judge barred such testimony about passenger <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> faces two manslaughter counts for the deaths of <LOCATION> Lloyd </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>. In the subsequent racial violence, one person was killed, 11 were wounded by gunfire and 13 buildings were burned down. If convicted on both counts, he would face a maximum penalty of 60 years imprisonment. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> fired one shot, hitting <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> in the head and killing him, as the motorcyclist sped away from another officer. The defense argues <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> acted in self-defense against a drug-crazed dealer who did not want to be sent back to jail, and was willing to run the officer over to escape.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a three-year $ 738 million aid package to reinforce efforts by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to discard communism and build democracy and free enterprise. The vote was 99-0. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action came on the eve of an address to a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity labor union, who is seeking a massive infusion of Western aid to energize his country's battered economy and shore up its flegling democracy. `` <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, this is for you and a free <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., immediately after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> acted `` This bill gives Solidarity a fighting chance to succeed,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> who was the bill's principal Democratic sponsor. `` Polish democracy deserves our firm support,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` To this point, our words have generally outstripped our deeds. This will help change that. `` It almost sounds trite to say that what is happening in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is mind-boggling, but thank God for it,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s work on the bill neared completion. `` We must do all we can afford, as quickly as we can, to help make these changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> irreversible,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill represents a bipartisan compromise over the scale of the aid plan, an issue that has been contentious from the start. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats originally had sought a three-year authorization level for the two East European nations of $ 989 million, while Republicans campaigned for a $ 585 million ceiling. All the proposals, including the $ 840 million authorized earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, overshadow the total $ 455 million proposed in increments over the last several months by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favors $ 738 million in aid for the two countries, White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` We're generally supportive. We'd like to get billions, if we had them.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, provided the first hard cash to back up the aid made possible by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> authorization bill. Lawmakers passed a foreign aid appropriations measure for the 1990 fiscal year that included $ 293 million for the first year of the three-year aid program, along with another $ 240 million in stand-by credit and trade insurance. Major elements of the appropriations measure included a $ 200 million grant to help stabilize <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s battered economy and $ 45 million for a private enterprise development fund. Other money would go for environmental cleanup, agriculture and educational and cultural exchanges. However, the money bill, the product of a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference, remained the subject of a veto threat over unrelated provisions which the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration opposes. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> authorization bill builds on key elements originally advocated by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, including Enterprise Funds to help both nations move away from communist centralized economies toward free-market systems. The Enterprise Funds, intended to help both countries establish free-market systems, would allocate $ 260 million for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and $ 65 million for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. In recognition of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s serious economic problems, the bill allocates $ 657 million for that country over three years. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would receive $ 81 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> compromise plan drops a $ 200 million credit stabilization plan for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> which Republicans said would only increase <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s large foreign debt. The only senator not voting for the aid plan was <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, who is ill.

<HEAD>European Community Summit Called to Consider Soviet-bloc Changes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> will meet Saturday in the <LOCATION> Elysee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> to analyze the surge of changes in the Soviet bloc and how they can influence <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s future instead of the superpowers. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, in a surprise move Monday, invited the other European Community -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- members to a special summit. There had been calls for such a meeting to be held before the summit of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> set for Dec. 2-3 aboard ships off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>, also known as the European Common Market, had scheduled a summit conference for Dec. 8-9 in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, but the flood of events in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> prompted <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to call the special meeting in advance of the U.S.-Soviet and <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> summits. Former French Foreign Minister <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobert </PERSON> said in a radio interview, `` Do we want the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, once again, to decide the destiny of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>?'' And former President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing, the leader of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s main centrist political coalition, had urged <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s socialist government to call an emergency <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> summit In a radio interview Sunday, Giscard d'Estaing said it would be `` unacceptable that the first analysis of the events in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> be made by the Americans and the Soviets and not by the Europeans.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> called Saturday's meeting as <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> president. He is president of the organization under a six-month rotating system and his term ends with the <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> summit. There were indications that most other <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> leaders welcomed the Elysee Palace summit. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, in a speech Monday night, did not refer to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s invitation but said, `` The Community should see what is happening as a great turning point in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s history, and its response must measure up to that.'' <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, the West German foreign minister, said it is important that `` the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> gets together on such a dramatic development. Besides analyzing the situation, one must also examine what the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> can do to help the people and to ensure that the reform process develops in a stable manner.'' In his invitations <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said the summit was called `` to discuss the recent developments in the situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' It is rare for <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> leaders to meet at the top level outside the framework of their semiannual summits and even more unusual that such a meeting could be organized so quickly. Analysts said the Elysee Palace dinner-summit could serve two major purposes: It gives the Europeans a chance to organize their position before the U.S.-Soviet conference and keeps the agenda of the <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> summit open for <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s two pet projects _ European monetary union and a European social charter. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> had asked <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to make the German question the central theme of the <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> meeting. That probably would have served Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and some West German officials who are not enthusiastic about a monetary union and social charter.

 <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusy </PERSON>, a leading Czechoslovak human rights activist, was convicted Tuesday of `` harming state interests abroad'' and given a suspended jail sentence of eight months, an emigre source reported. The source, speaking privately, said the court in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> acquitted <LOCATION> Hana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ponicka </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Selecky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Manak </PERSON>, who were charged with sedition last summer together with <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON>, another activist. All five had signed a statement urging Slovaks to mark the 21st anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of August 1968, which crushed the brief `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> spring'' of reform, by laying flowers in memory of the victims. About 100 supporters, who could not get into the court building in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> for the two-day trial, shouted `` Long live freedom!'' and `` Long live <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>!'' after the verdicts were announced. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief who led the 1968 reform and was disgraced afterward, attended the trial. The court changed original charges of sedition and subversion against <PERSON> Kusy </PERSON> to `` harming state interests abroad'' under Article 112 of the criminal code, which appeared to be a lesser charge, the source in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> said. The maximum prison term for sedition is five years. <PERSON> Kusy </PERSON>, a party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> secretary in 1968, was expelled from the party after the invasion. <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic activist who has been held since Aug. 14, faces charges of sedition and subversion, but his trial was suspended because his lawyer is ill. He was brought to the courtroom in handcuffs Tuesday and asked to testify as a witness, but refused, said <ORGANIZATION> Palach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, a newsletter based in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that monitors human rights in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. It said <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON> would be tried next Monday and Tuesday. Last week, about 200 people demonstrated in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> for his release.

 The friendly weekend invasion from the East when the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall was opened cost the West German government $ 82 million in `` welcome money,'' the city's bankers said Tuesday. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> bank association said 1.5 million visitors from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> came through the wall and banks gave each 100 marks -LRB- $ 55 -RRB- on the government's behalf, for a total of 150 million marks, or about $ 82 million. Figures were not available from the other parts of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> visited by 1.5 million more East Germans, but the total paid in `` welcome money'' probably was double the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> figure. By government policy, each East German visitor is entitled to 100 marks once a year. East Germans traveling abroad can take along only 15 West German marks, equivalent to a little more than $ 8, and East German marks are not covertible. Earlier Tuesday, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> banks threatened to suspend payments of `` welcome money'' unless <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> covered their operating costs, and the government agreed. The banks stayed open most of the weekend to handle long lines of East Germans. Officials said the government was raising its total `` welcome money'' allocation from 479 million marks to 779 million.

 The black nationalist movement that fought South African rule for 23 years won a solid majority Tuesday in national elections but will have to bargain with rival parties in drafting a new constitution. The leftist <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> won 384,567 votes, or 57 percent of 670,830 ballots cast, according to results announced Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s leaders had predicted their movement would easily win the two-thirds majority that would have enabled it to single-handedly write the constitution. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy, finished second with 191,532 votes, or 29 percent. Thousands of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> supporters filled the streets of <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, the capital, waving flags, singing and honking horns throughout the day. The celebration carried on into the night in <LOCATION> Katutura </LOCATION>, the main black neighborhood on the edge of <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>. In the northern town of <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION>, more than 20 people were hurt in a clash between <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> and alliance supporters, a doctor said. At least two were seriously injured, one with a bullet wound, another with a stab wound, said Dr. <PERSON> Kalumbi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangula </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Oshakati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` We struggled all the years for this day,'' said <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>. South African President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said his government was `` grateful that the election proceeded peacefully, and thus accepts the outcome.'' Namibians voted from Tuesday through Saturday for a 72-member assembly that will draft a constitution and declare independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> after 74 years of South African rule. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> will hold 41 seats in the assembly, and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> 21. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> will have four seats, followed by the conservative, all-white <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION>, with three. The Federal Convention of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Namibia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> each won a single seat. The assembly's decisions must be backed by at least 48 members. `` In spite of the difficulties, in spite of all the odds placed in our way to victory, the liberation movement has won,'' said senior <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hidipo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamutenya </PERSON>. The election result was seen as promising for a peaceful transition to independence for the sparsely populated region of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Some observers feared that if <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> won a two-thirds majority, it might have written a constitution leaning heavily in its favor. Had the organization won less than 50 percent of the vote, it may have challenged the results and accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of trying to prevent a <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> government. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudge </PERSON>, said his organization had no plans to align itself with another party, but `` if <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> comes with a -LRB- constitutional -RRB- proposal we can live with, we will support it.'' The assembly is to meet within a week, and the 1,500 South African troops in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> are to withdraw shortly. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers are scheduled to leave <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> at the end of March. The top <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, said he expected <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to achieve independence before then. <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, who certified the election results, said <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> `` has given the whole world a shining lesson in democracy.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he was confident the various parties would be able to work through their differences and adopt a constitution `` with the same degree of enthusiasm and patriotism that they displayed during the course of the electoral process.'' In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitors, dozens of private groups observed the elections. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON>, a former senator and secretary of state who headed the official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, said `` the process of the elections was victory by and for the Namibian people.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it wished the <LOCATION> Namibian </LOCATION> people well as they start drafting the new constitution. `` We look forward to working with the government that emerges after independence,'' said the statement. In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, a delegation of European parliamentarians sent to observe the elections said there had been no fraud. `` There was no fraud possible,'' said <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Saby </PERSON>, head of the 13-member delegation. He said the vote took place `` in an extraordinary climate of good citizenship.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> captured <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in World War I and ruled it under a League of Nations mandate. That mandate was rescinded by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1966, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> refused <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> orders to withdraw from the territory. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> took up arms against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1966. In December 1988, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to grant independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> as part of a regional treaty that also called for the phased withdrawal of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor.

<HEAD>Palestinian Leader Talks Peace to Jewish, Arab Students</HEAD>

 As right-wing Israelis shouted and banged their fists on lecture hall doors Tuesday, a pro-PLO Palestinian leader and hundreds of Jewish and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> students discussed the bloody conflict between their people. Several fistfights erupted outside the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> lecture hall shortly after <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a leading Palestinian activist, was led in, encircled by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> students. Security guards and plainclothes police scuffled with dozens of right-wing activists wearing the knitted skullcaps of observant Jews, and at least one Israeli was dragged out, kicking and pushing. But inside, the peace dialogue went on as planned by a left-wing Arab-Jewish student group and the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It was designed to mark the first anniversary of the declaration of Palestinian independence issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile. `` We're fighting for our own freedom and not for the enslavement of others, for our own country and not for the destruction of another country,'' declared <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, who comes from one of the most powerful Palestinian families. `` I want to send a message to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders: there's no other way to peace but through the leaders of another people, and this leadership is the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said, interrupted by loud applause. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it officially sees as a terrorist group bent on destroying the Jewish state. It is willing to negotiate elections with non-PLO Palestinians from the occupied territories and then hold talks on limited autonomy with the elected delegates. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, who has been jailed without trial for a total of 18 months since July 1987, insisted that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> if it wants to negotiate peace. `` I want to talk peace with -LRB- Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> said. `` I think he's a man of war, I do n't want to talk to him and I do n't like him. But he is representing the Israeli people. Your enemies are the Palestinians and they have representatives.'' A Jewish student argued that Arabs from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> could represent the Palestinian side. `` It's well known you receive your orders from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the student. `` The Jewish people have a psychological problem with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, so why do n't you stop calling them the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and start peace talks?'' <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> countered by saying it has been equally difficult for him to pronounce the word `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Outside, right-wingers banged on the doors, shouting: `` PLO out! You are a leader of killers, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, go to hell!'' An Israeli student jumped from his seat, shouting at <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>: `` You're <PERSON> Nazis </PERSON>, you're killing Jews every day!'' He was dragged out of the hall by force. An Arab student then demanded to know what the next stage of the 23-month-old Palestinian uprising should be. `` The struggle we want to lead is civil disobedience,'' <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> responded. `` We are pushed to it by the occupation. We can reach a solution before that, if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> starts to treat us as people, not as residents or refugees.'' At least 615 Palestinians have died of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> gunfire, and 41 Israelis have been slain in the rebellion. At the end of the three-hour meeting, security guards whisked <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> away through a back door _ only to find the windshield of his car smashed.

Pacho is about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cuernavaca </LOCATION> is named for a city in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> is known as `` The Mexican'' because of his admiration for that country.

 <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was transferred Tuesday to a center at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deaconess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> that treats mood disorders, a week after she was hospitalized because she drank rubbing alcohol. A recovering alcoholic with a history of depression, the 52-year-old wife of Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was transferred from <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital to the Deaconess affective disorders unit for evaluation, the governor's office said. Affective disorder is a psychiatric term referring to such problems as mood swings and depression. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' doctor has said she suffers from depression. <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the governor, said it was n't known how long Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would remain at Deaconess Asked if Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was being treated for a combination of depression and alcoholism, Ms. <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON> said: `` those are some of the issues relating to her treatment that Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is only discussing with her family and her doctors.'' <PERSON> Janna </PERSON> <PERSON> Crittendon </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Deaconess, said Tuesday that Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' condition was `` satisfactory.'' The affective disorders unit is a 27-bed section run by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> faculty, Ms. <PERSON> Crittendon </PERSON> said. It offers diagnosis and treatment of patients, she said. The average length of stay is 16 days. Symptoms of mood disorder include disturbed sleep and disrupted appetite and can leave the sufferer unable to concentrate on daily activities, Ms. <PERSON> Crittendon </PERSON> said. Such disorders can be associated with substance abuse, Ms. <PERSON> Crittendon </PERSON> said, adding that she was speaking generally and not about Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' case. Deaconess specializes in treating the more complex and chronic diseases, Ms. <PERSON> Crittendon </PERSON> said. It is known in particular for research and treatment of heart ailments, cancer and AIDS and as a venue for organ transplants, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was admitted to <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's on Nov. 6 after drinking a small amount of rubbing alcohol. The governor said Monday his wife had `` a slip,'' or a relapse back into drinking when she swallowed the rubbing alcohol. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was treated for alcoholism last March. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had earlier admitted to a long-term dependency on diet pills, for which she also has received treatment. Also on Tuesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' attorney on her book project, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, said the memoir was about 95 percent completed and needs a couple weeks more work. <ORGANIZATION> Publisher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster still plans to release the book next summer, he said. When Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is feeling able, she will finish the book with her collaborator, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Scovell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He would not discuss whether new material on her latest hospitalization would be included.

 A Salvadoran rebel leader said Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>'s armed forces must be purged of a `` truly criminal'' element before the rebels will resume peace talks with the government. Commander <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> of the political-diplomatic commission of the guerrillas' <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- also said there would not be an immediate end to the offensive launched by the left-wing rebels Saturday night. `` This is a military campaign ... of very great scope,'' he said. `` The general command has ordered its forces to maintain positions and advance.'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> spoke at a news conference at the foreign correspondents' club He said civilians have been joining the rebels, but declined to give any figures. `` This is a process of insurrection. I could n't say how far it will go,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> has been seeking international mediation between the rebels and President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s rightist government, but there have been no results. A proposal Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by Nicaraguan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> could lead to such mediation, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said. He did not elaborate. He said before the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> stops the offensive and agrees to resume peace talks there must be a `` self-purge of the armed forces'' that would lead to more democratic conditions. `` The ones who govern <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> are the armed forces; it's a sector within the armed forces that is making the war a great business,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said. `` There can be no democratic process in the country without a purge of the armed forces.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` always has bet on a military triumph over the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> and that has n't changed with -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' but the rebel leadership is open to talks with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 The jogger who was gang-raped, beaten and left for dead during a teen-age `` wilding'' spree in Central Park was released Tuesday from a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> hospital after nearly seven months of rehabilitation. The jogger, a 29-year-old investment banker originally from the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> area, will continue outpatient treatment at <LOCATION> Gaylord </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wallingford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, a spokesman there said. She still is unable to recall the attack and its aftermath, `` but she has made good recovery and rehabilitation,'' said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Main </PERSON>. On April 19, the jogger was on her nightly run in the park when she was dragged 200 feet into the underbrush, raped, beaten with a pipe and a rock and left unconscious. When police found her 3 -LCB- hours later, she was in a coma and had lost almost 80 percent of her blood. She suffered brain contusions, two head fractures, broken facial bones and bruises from head to toe. Paramedics did not expect her to live. She remained in critical condition at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hospital until May 1, when she appeared to raise her eyebrows as her name was called and raised her hand. She was walking a bit when she was moved June 7 to <LOCATION> Gaylord </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. By midsummer, she was reading novels, relearning basic math and calling colleagues at <LOCATION> Salomon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bros. </LOCATION>, where she worked before the attack. Main said the jogger and her family thanked the public and press for their support over the past months. `` This support has made a difference in her ability to recover,'' he read from the statement. He said they also thanked news media for respecting her privacy and anonymity and stressed that the woman's continued recovery `` is highly dependent'' on her privacy and anonymity being maintained. Main would not say what time the patient left the hospital or where she went, or comment beyond the prepared statement. The brutality of the attack focused attention on the phenomenon of `` wilding,'' in which young criminals roam from victim to victim to harass, attack and rob. The city's legions of joggers were unwilling to surrender the park, which stretches 2 -LCB- miles through the center of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. In June, prompted by the attack, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Runners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> launched a safety program. Six teen-agers have been indicted in the attack: <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Salaam </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antron </PERSON> <PERSON> McCray </PERSON>, all 15, and Kharey Wise, 17. All currently are involved in a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on whether statements they gave police should be allowed as evidence at their upcoming trials. Defense lawyers maintain the statements, in which nearly all the youth implicate themselves or their codefendants, were coerced and therefore illegal. Police said those indicted were part of a gang of more than 30 youths on the `` wilding'' spree.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, which is suspending most most training activities for 48 hours over the next three days to review safety, has experienced 10 serious accidents in less than three weeks, the most recent being a fire Tuesday that injured at least 31 people. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the `` safety stand-down'' order requires every ship, squadron and shore training facility to interrupt normal operations and review basic safety and operating procedures. The order came about six hours after fire broke out on the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inchon </ORGANIZATION>, an amphibious assault ship undergoing maintenance at the shipyard in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>. Also Tuesday, an F-14 crashed into the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> 60 miles northwest of Key West, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The two-man crew bailed out and was not seriously injured. At the same time, a technician at the Naval Surface Weapons Testing Center in White Oak, Md. was slightly injured when two grams of an experimental explosive detonated in a laboratory. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said 23 sailors and eight civilians were injured and were taken to six hospitals from the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> fire. At least one victim was listed in serious condition. Since the run of mishaps started Oct. 29, 10 people have been killed or lost at sea and at least 53 people have been injured. Between Jan. 1 and Nov. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> counted 101 `` operation and training related'' fatalities in the service, including 47 in the explosion aboard the USS Iowa on April 19. The most serious of the recent accidents occurred Oct. 29 when a jet pilot making his first landing on an aircraft carrier crashed into the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The pilot and four others on deck the ship were killed. There has been some debate over the accidents. Earlier in the month, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called the mishaps `` an extraordinary grouping of unrelated accidents. Others like <PERSON> Karlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, an industrial psychologist, warned that cutting training budgets can lead to accidents. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is always trying to cut training budgets ... It's a prescription for disaster,'' she said. Other incidents include: _ A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> reserve pilot flying a A-7E jet crashed Nov. 9 into an apartment complex in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, killing two civilians and injuring two others, including himself _ Three sailors and a reported $ 4 million worth of non-nuclear missiles were swept by a wave from the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> on Nov. 1 One sailor was presumed dead. _ Nine sailors were treated for burns or smoke inhalation when fire erupted in the boiler aboard the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION>, some 500 miles west of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> on Nov. 1 _ A F-A-18 pilot dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided missile cruiser USS Reeves in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, causing minor injuries to five sailors and blowing a five-foot hole in the ship's bow on Oct. 30 _ A sailor aboard the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vinson </ORGANIZATION> fell into the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> about 620 miles north of <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Oct. 30 and was presumed lost _ Over the Nov. 11-12 weekend, one man was killed and five were injured when the USS Kinkaid, a destroyer, collided off the coast of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> with a 430-foot freighter

 Drought-induced crop failure in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s two rebellious northern provinces will be worse this season than in the 1984-85 famine that killed 1 million people, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund An internal document from <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> obtained Tuesday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> says up to 2 million Ethiopians could be affected by the drought as famine conditions develop in 1990. In 1984-85, relief figures indicate 1 million people starved to death in the northern provinces of <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>; in 1987-88, a massive international relief operation prevented a similar tragedy during another crop failure. `` The first signs of famine already have been reported, not only in ... <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, where influxes of displaced people are on the increase, but also in other areas, in particular <LOCATION> Akele </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guzay </LOCATION> district, where farmers are selling their livestock at only one-third of the normal price,'' the report says. `` Livestock disposal at very low prices is one of the early warning indicators that a drought situation is becoming alarming,'' it said. <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> officials said they will soon announce a $ 9.05 million fund-raising campaign to provide food and services to northern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> to prevent widespread starvation. `` This drought _ according to the assessments of the main harvest planting made by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies, including <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, and by the government of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> _ will be worse than in 1984-85 in terms of crop failure,'' the report says. `` In <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, the crop failure is estimated to be 90 to 100 percent, while in Tigre it reaches 40 percent,'' it says. `` Furthermore, these two regions are afflicted by civil wars respectively 28 and 15 years old, which restrict movements of goods and people and limit the access of assistance.'' Rebels in those provinces are fighting for autonomy or secession from the Marxist central government, controlled by President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON>. Up to 333,000 metric tons of grain will be needed to feed 1.85 million people, the <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> report says.

 Amnesty International charged on Wednesday that <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s military rulers have arrested thousands of people, carried out unfair trials and are holding political prisoners. The London-based human rights group called for the commutation of 100 death sentences that have been handed down by the martial law government and for the release of all political prisoners. The Amnesty report, received in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, listed 107 `` prisoners of conscience'' and other political prisoners believed still in detention. Amnesty defines prisoners of conscience as people detained solely for peacefully expressing their beliefs. The list of prisoners included the nation's top opposition leader, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, as well as a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk and a novelist. Most on the list were students and members of <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>'s National League for Democracy Amnesty quoted unnamed sources as saying more than 3,000 people had been arrested since July 1989. The organization said it could not confirm this number because it had not been able to visit <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, but it documented the arrests of a number of political opponents to the regime. `` Amnesty believes that arrests during this period -LRB- after late July -RRB- numbered in the thousands,'' the report said. Last month, the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> government announced it had arrested 1,087 people for political offenses since September 1988, when a group of military leaders brutally crushed a nationwide pro-democracy uprising. The leaders set up a 17-man military council and declared martial law. But the formation of more than 200 political parties has been allowed and the military is promising general elections May 27 of next year. The house arrest last July of <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> and Tin Oo, leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, along with other senior members of the pro-democracy party led many Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> to conclude that free elections were unlikely. The government also has said it had handed down 100 death sentences, many by special military tribunals. Amnesty described some of the trials as unfair by international standards. Similar charges have been made in recent months by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which also claims some political detainess have died under torture. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> has denied this. In a speech Nov. 10 Gen. <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, who heads the military government, said citizens had nothing to be afraid of `` unless, of course, you break the law.'' `` There are accusations that we are following the methods of the Japanese <PERSON> Kempetai </PERSON>.

If they say we use Gestapo methods then they are wrong too,'' Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> told a graduating class at <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The Japanese secret police <PERSON> Kempetai </PERSON> and the Nazi's <ORGANIZATION> Gestapo </ORGANIZATION> employed torture and committed other atrocities during World War II.

<HEAD>Saturday Launch For NASA's Last Unmanned Rocket, Early Universe Probe</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s planned launch of its last unmanned rocket Saturday will send the first of several satellites to study how the universe has evolved since its birth in the `` big bang'' 15 billion years ago, officials said Tuesday. The new launch date for the $ 150 million, 4,850-pound Cosmic Background Explorer was announced after space agency engineers fixed a faulty guidance computer on the rocket that will carry the spacecraft into orbit. `` This is going to begin an explosion of knowledge about the universe,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, manager of the $ 400 million Cosmic Background Explorer program, said during a news conference at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The satellite, the Hubble Space Telescope and three other observatories to be placed in Earth orbit during the 1990s `` are going to provide us with an unprecedented, unbelievable view of the universe,'' program scientist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Caroff </PERSON> said. `` We will see things we have n't even imagined,'' he predicted. `` Hold on to your hats because this is going to shake up the world of science.'' The satellite is scheduled for launch from <ORGANIZATION> Vandenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> on the central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast during a 30-minute period starting at 6:24 a.m. PST Saturday. The 16-by-28-foot, solar-powered satellite is to be carried into a 559-mile-high, near-polar orbit by a 116-foot-tall Delta rocket, the last unmanned, expendable rocket to be launched by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will continue to launch manned shuttles and possibly unmanned cargo shuttles with reusable boosters. But the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> or private companies will charge <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to launch any payloads that require unmanned, expendable rockets. The satellite's launch had been scheduled for Friday, then was delayed until Sunday because of a malfunctioning guidance computer. But the computer was replaced so quickly last weekend that the launch was moved up to Saturday, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> rocket official. The satellite was to have originally been put in orbit by a shuttle, but was diverted to an unmanned rocket after the 1986 Challenger disaster. Once in orbit and after a 30-day shakedown, the satellite will spend up to two years measuring cosmic background radiation, which makes up about 2 percent of the static on a television set. It includes microwaves, heat and other electromagnetic radiation given off by the `` big bang,'' the gargantuan explosion scientists believe created the universe an estimated 15 billion years ago. `` The radiation we're measuring is actually the remnant of the great explosion itself,'' project scientist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> said. `` We're looking at it as it was a very long time ago. We're seeing the primary cosmic fossil.'' With the three most sensitive sensors of their types, the satellite will measure `` the collective glow of all the stars and galaxies and whatever else has been there since the beginning,'' <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> said. That will help scientists learn more about what happened in the time between three minutes after the big bang, when the first atomic nuclei or centers formed, and 500,000 years later, when the first atoms formed. It also will search for light from the creation of the first stars and galaxies about 200 million years after the primeval fireball. <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will share information from the mission with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which has flown one similar research mission and plans two others. A shuttle is scheduled to carry the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit in March. An optical telescope of unprecedented power, it also may see formation of the earliest galaxies, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON>, deputy project scientist on the Cosmic Background Explorer program. That will be followed by the shuttle launches of the <ORGANIZATION> Gamma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in June and the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility in 1997, <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> said. A private, expendable rocket will launch the Space Infrared Telescope Facility in 1999, he added.

 <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has refused to allow former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> to enter the country to visit a Taiwanese dissident jailed for advocating independence for this island, another dissident said Tuesday. <PERSON> Hsieh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsung-min </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, now a human rights lawyer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, planned to arrive in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Monday.

 A convict described by friends as a `` Dr. <PERSON> Jekyll </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>'' was charged Tuesday with the slayings of two police officers whose failure to follow regulations proved fatal, authorities said. <PERSON> Stoney </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, 25, was arrested late Monday at a girlfriend's home after a 10-hour citywide manhunt, police said He was arraigned Tuesday evening on four counts of second degree murder and returned to jail. Two of the murder counts charged him with the deaths of the two detectives and the other two with felony murder, or murder during the furtherance of a crime _ which was escape. He also was charged with first-degree escape and second-degree criminal possession of a weapon. The maximum penalty for murder in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is 25 years to life. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> had been taken from jail to the <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> district attorney's office Monday to take a lie detector test and discuss a plea bargain. Later, a series of mistakes allowed <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> to steal a loaded gun and surprise the two officers while they were returning him to the city's jail complex on <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, authorities said Tuesday. `` If you make a mistake in this business, it can have terrible results. ... These two detectives got careless for a minute or two and it cost them their lives,'' Police Commissioner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said at a news conference Tuesday. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> was able to fire at least five shots from the stolen gun while he was being driven down Grand Central Parkway. Neither officer was able to reach revolvers in their ankle holsters and both were dead at the scene. They were identified as Detectives <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 34, an eight-year veran, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerzon </PERSON>, 46, a 20-year veteran, of <PERSON> Merrick </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Guerzon </LOCATION> is to be buried Thursday, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> on Friday. The suspect's story is that the two officers were shot during a robbery, and the gunman freed him after killing the detectives, said Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. During his brief arraignment in state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> stood silently as defense attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Selio </PERSON> said he reserved the right to make a bail application at a later date. The errors began, authorities said, when <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> was left alone in a detectives' squad room, where he stole the gun from either an unlocked locker or one with a defective lock. Prisoners kept in the room are usually handcuffed to a pipe out of reach of the lockers. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> was supposed to be searched before his return to <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>; either he was n't or someone failed to locate the .38 - caliber service revolver during their check, <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> might also have been cuffed with his hands in front, rather than behind his back, he said. On the way back to <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> was seated alone in the back seat, with the two detectives in front _ another violation of procedure, said <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Guerzon </PERSON>, who had been driving, was shot twice in the head. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was shot twice in the back and once in the head. Despite his criminal background, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s neighbors said he was a well-behaved man whose mother made sure he received the best of everything. `` He does n't come off as arrogant, always was friendly and polite,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who has known the mother and son for 15 years. `` He's like a Dr. <PERSON> Jekyll </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> personality.'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> has a record dating to 1980, when he was convicted of assault at age 16. After several drug and additional assault charges, he was sentenced to 364 days in jail four years ago for biting off a girlfriend's ear. At the time of the police shootings, he was serving a two-to-four-year sentence on a drug conviction. He also was charged in July with strangling another girlfriend after a night of partying and drug-taking and still faced trial. In October, he and his mother were arrested for allegedly conspiring to murder a witness against him in the July murder. He allegedly had his mother offer $ 2,000 to a hit man who turned out to be an undercover detective.

<HEAD>House Gives Speaker Access To Secret Files</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday changed its rules, which it has been violating for years, to give its speaker full access to secret files and hearings in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, R-Ill., used the occasion to tout several proposals he has offered but which have been stymied by the Democratic leadership: requirement of a secrecy oath and security clearances for members and staff on the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and a reduction in the size of the panel from 19 to 13 members But <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>'s effort to bring the issues up for a vote was defeated on a largely party-line vote of 245 to 176. The old rules specified that no classified information could be given to anyone not a member of the intelligence panel unless the committee first voted to authorize the move and kept detailed records of the information and to whom it was given. But even though they are not members of the committee, speakers of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> have over the years received informal briefings on government secrets. The rules change adopted Tuesday gives <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., and his successors blanket access to the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s business <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> formerly was a member of the committee and maintains an active interest in intelligence matters. The issue of speakers' access to secrets arose last year when former Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told reporters the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had sought to foment civil unrest in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to undermine the political stability of the leftist Sandinista government.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said Tuesday it was willing to give <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> massive financial aid in the style of the postwar <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marshall Plan, but demanded political and economic reforms the Communists have so far rejected. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new premier said the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> must remain, to keep AIDS, crime and other Western problems out of his country. He promised a coalition government but did not say whether the opposition could join it. After a week of dramatic developments in East European countries, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>: `` They have a common direction, which fosters the building of a European home, for it makes the countries closer, more open and creates new opportunities for human contact and an equal exchange.'' The Liberal Democrats, an East German party that is allied with the Communists but shows signs of independence, said pro-democracy groups should be invited in `` round-table'' talks about <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s future. Discussions this spring between Polish authorities and Solidarity, which were given that name, led to a non-Communist government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Momper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said the sudden opening of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s borders was creating traffic jams, currency problems and other economic difficulties the two governments must resolve. Economics Minister <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> announced a six-point aid plan including investments, joint ventures and modernizing <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s dilapidated communications and transport systems. <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> did not name a figure for the aid and said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> must achieve `` thorough change'' in its centrally directed economy. Reforms promised so far by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, who took over last month from hard-liner <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, have resulted in more questions than answers, <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. He compared his proposal to the Marshall Plan devised by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, which provided more than $ 12 billion in American aid in 1948-51 to help <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> recover from the war. East German authorities have rejected the idea of adopting a complete free-market system and new Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, a leading reformer, says he wants `` step by step'' economic changes. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> appears to want a streamlining of the bureaucracy, but has given no indication he will urge sweeping changes such as those in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. He was quoted Tuesday in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> as saying the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall can remain open to travel, but will not come down. `` In our country there is little criminal activity ... cases of AIDS and drugs are virtually unknown,'' he was quoted as saying. `` Our people are asking themselves why they should n't just leave that as it is.'' ADN, the official news agency, said the government might open a part of the wall near the Brandenburg Gate as yet another passage between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The high-columned monument is near the wall in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and is among the city's best-known symbols. <LOCATION> Before </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> opened its borders Thursday, the gate had been a major rallying point for demonstrators seeking freedom to travel to the West. Hundreds of West Berliners gathered there Tuesday in hopes a hole would be opened. A leader of New Forum, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s main opposition group, said it could work with a revamped <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> but naming <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> premier was not enough. `` There are still too many people in top positions with whom dialogue is not possible,'' <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallig </PERSON>, spokesman for the group in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, said in a West German radio interview. More change could occur at a special party congress in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Dec. 15-17. The congress, which can change the entire leadership, set policy and alter party statutes, was called late Monday by the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Pro-democracy advocates have held huge demonstrations demanding an end for the 40-year Communist monopoly on power. Although <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> did not indicate whether the opposition would be allowed in his coalition, he pledged to seek more cooperation with the four small parties allied with the Communists. <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON>, one of the most prominent Politburo members and a leading reformer, resigned as party chief for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said, and was replaced by <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> had indicated earlier he might surrender the post because of a heavy workload. He still is the party propaganda chief and political analysts believe he may get an important job in <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>'s cabinet. <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> <PERSON> Maleuda </PERSON>, the new, non-Communist speaker of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said he would seek to alter the first article of the constitution, which defines the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s leading role in society. The party has used the provision to defend its power monopoly. The East German <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said its reception centers could handle up to 10,000 East Germans returning home. The West German <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said it expected several thousand of the 200,000 who had settled in the West this year to return to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Mass emigration has cost <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> vital skilled workers and has strained the ability of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to provide jobs and housing.

 A survey of 4,500 small business owners found that three-quarters of them believe leveraged buyouts are bad for business, the survey's sponsors reported Tuesday. The survey, conducted by <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the Big Eight accounting firm, got responses from 4,500 small and medium-sized business owners through out the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The survey found that 77 percent of those participating believed that buying a company with money borrowed against the company's assets are bad for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business environment, with 22 percent of them saying it was `` extremely negative.

The survey, now in its fourth year, also reported that more than 80 percent of the business owners have had difficulty attracting qualified managerial and technical personnel and 67 percent said they were unable to find qualified semi-skilled workers.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee on Tuesday endorsed new versions of two vetoed spending bills that comply with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s demand that they maintain a ban on most federally funded abortions, including cases of rape or incest. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said it was time for abortion-rights activists to `` face the fact'' that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would prevail this year in the dispute. But House Democrats who support abortion rights said they may continue their fight. A leading abortion opponent said his group still objects to one of the revised <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bills, however, because it would allow local money to be spent on abortions for poor women in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. A group of four pro-choice <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> women, meanwhile, met with the president to express their concern over his position on the federal abortion issue. And on still another abortion fight, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> backed away from risking a third <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto on a foreign aid bill that includes $ 15 million for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Population Fund. The bill would reverse a five-year ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to that agency, which promotes Third World family planning and birth control. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has threatened to veto the bill because of a provision fought by abortion opponents. They charged that because the agency operates in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which has a one-child-per-family policy, the money would indirectly support forced abortions there _ despite a stipulation in the bill that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> money not be used in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted against a move by anti-abortion forces to take out the population fund money, but then voted 219-203 to accept an amendment that allows <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to block the money if he concludes it would be used for coerced abortions. The House Appropriations Committee voted unanimously and without debate to send to the floor a revised version of the $ 157 billion bill for fiscal 1990 appropriations for labor, education and health programs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed the bill last month because of a provision that would permit greater use of federal money for abortions for poor women, allowing them for victims of rape or incest. The panel also approved a revised bill appropriating $ 558 million for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed that measure last month, objecting to provisions that would have allowed the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> government to use its own money to finance abortions for poor women. The new version of the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> bill would prohibit the use of federal money for abortions in most cases. But <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, lobbyist for the anti-abortion <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said it would still permit the district to spend other government money for abortions _ and thus invites another veto in its new version. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the larger spending bill last month after voting for the first time in a decade to broaden the restrict the prohibitions on abortion financing. But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> failed by 51 votes to override <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto. `` Without the votes to overturn that veto, we have to face the fact that there's going to be a denial of funds,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday, adding that pro-choice forces could try again next year. `` The president has to take responsibilty for that decision,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore., a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> abortion-rights forces and a member of the appropriations committee, said it would have been futile for his side to try to amend the bill in the committee He said abortion opponents may easily thwart floor amendments using parliamentary means as well. But he said abortion-rights forces in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, who have a larger majority in that chamber, could force the debate to continue by voting again to permit financing in cases of rape or incest _ an outcome that could for a second time send the bill to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> to work out differences. `` That's where the end game is going to be fought _ in the conference,'' <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON> said. The abortion dispute is caught up in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' hurry to adjourn for the year, as well as concerns by some Republicans that anti-abortion positions hurt their candidates in last week's elections and could hurt them further in 1990 `` The temperature is going to build, and we'll see how everyone feels when the temperature rises even further,'' <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON> said. `` I just have a feeling in my bones that a lot of people who have been opposed to our pro-choice position are very eager to find a way to now support the victims of rape and incest, and we intend before it's all over to give them a chance,'' he said. Four <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> women who support abortion rights came away from the meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saying they had voiced concerns that the party would be damaged by an identification with anti-abortion forces. They said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> listened to their arguments but gave them no commitment to relent in his opposition to the bills permitting more federally funded abortions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to speak at campaign fund-raisers for two of the women, who are planning <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bids. One of them, Rep. <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, said: `` We could see the wheels of thought going through his mind. ... I think he heard us.''

 House leaders on Tuesday were forced to slow their push for a 33 percent congressional pay raise after the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> balked at approving an attached ethics package. White House counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> told lawmakers the plan failed to impose enough ethics restrictions on the legislative branch, similar to those governing the executive branch, according to congressional sources. House Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders canceled party caucuses planned for Wednesday when, by the end of the day Tuesday, the differences were not resolved. The caucuses were tentatively rescheduled for Thursday and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> scheduled changed to accommodate them. Time was of the essence, because of plans to adjourn <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before Thanksgiving. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said he remained confident He was leading an in-House lobbying effort rarely seen for even the most important legislation. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., plan to appear before the House Republican Conference, while their <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> counterparts, Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., and Minority Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., were going before the No one could remember that happening. The `` rather unprecedented show of bipartisan support'' would coincide with formal introduction of the pay and ethics plan, said Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the panel that drafted the proposal In advance of public release of the plan, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders put the pressure on in private meetings of committees and state delegations. They urged support for the package, provided arguments to use when defending it with constituents _ and urged those opposing the package to do so quietly. The extraordinary effort was afoot because pay is one of the most politically sensitive issues in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. To ease the electoral angst, the pay plan would put off the bulk of the increase until after next year's election. A raise of 7.9 percent would take effect on Jan. 1, 1990, raising congressional pay from $ 89,500 to $ 96,600. A year later, lawmakers would get a 25 percent increase. Federal judges and top executive branch officials, whose pay is tied to that of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, would also get the increases. The initial increase was being billed as a `` cost-of-living adjustment.'' The second installment would be tied to an end to members' bolstering their personal incomes by making speeches to interest groups Good-government groups, including Common Cause, have attacked the acceptance of speech honoraria as a corrupting force in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> said Tuesday that the pay plan was set up so that if the 25 percent raise is later killed, the honoraria system would be restored. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would also consider eliminating honoraria but over a longer timetable than the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and without the 25 percent raise. However, support among senators for that position was difficult to determine. Sen. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss., said he considered different pay scales for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` a mistake. Sen. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., said he thought it would be `` hypocritical. <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> said he favored having the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> adopt something very close to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan, with only small changes in the ethics rules to account for institutional differences. But how many senators shared his viewpoint was hard to determine because members were playing their cards close until the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> acts. Bring up the issue and you get `` a lot of smiles and ducking out back doors,'' he said. The waffling in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> generated nervousness in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where the last thing members want to do is vote for a pay raise and not get it. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was handling it `` in their normal manner, which is the way most multi-millionaires do They pound their breasts and say we do n't dare talk about the possibility of a cost of living adjustment, while they live off their interest and speaking fees.'' On the average, senators have much more personal wealth than <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members. Their current rules also allow them to bolster their incomes by up to 40 percent with speaking fees, compared to 30 percent in the House. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership spent several hours Tuesday working out final details of the package with <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. `` Let there be no doubt about the president's support for the ethics package. It's ours,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We just want them to pass a good, strong package that meets up to the standards we set in our proposal.''

 Talks between Nicaraguan officials and the Contra rebels remained deadlocked Tuesday night as the two sides were unable to bridge their differences over terms for a cease-fire and for demobilization of the insurgents, participants said. As the fourth day of talks ended, Nicaraguan Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> told reporters he was less optimistic Tuesday night than he was last Thursday when the negotiations opened at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Asked why there is a stalemate, <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> said, `` It's difficult because each side has his own point of view. The head of the Sandinista delegation, Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, said he was somewhat more optimistic than he was after the conclusion of the talks Monday night. The discussions will resume Wednesday afternoon. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> is officially described as a `` witness'' at the talks. Also participating are representatives from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Honduran government. A key sticking point is a Sandinista demand that rebels now based inside Nicaraguan territory return to base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> immediately after a joint cease-fire is achieved. At that point, the demobilization of the Contras would begin. The rebel position is that the estimated 5,000 Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> should be allowed to remain at their positions once the cease fire is called. The chief Contra negotiator, Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, said the rebels are wary of demobilization because it is an `` irreversible step'' that must be accompanied by guarantees for the rebels' safety The Sandinista position further states that once all Contra forces have returned to the base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would turn over to an international commission humanitarian funds earmarked for the Contras. The funds would be used `` to contribute to the peace process,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> proposal asserts.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, alarmed over a string of serious accidents, Tuesday ordered an unprecedented stand-down from most routine manuevers to permit `` a hard look at all levels and at every detail'' of safety. The order requires ships, air squadrons and shore installations to interrupt normal operations and review basic safety and operating procedures for a 48-hour period sometime during the next three days. However, it will allow such operations as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ship movements in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and drug interdiction activities to continue. Adm. <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, the chief of naval operations who ordered the action, said it is the first time in his memory the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has done such a thing. `` Prudent leadership demands that we take look at everything that might be a possible ause for this recent spate of accidents, regardless of their severity,'' <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> told reporters at a hastily called Pentagon press conference. The admiral said the review asks all commanders to ask, `` Are we adhering to all the proper procedures, are we doing what we should be, the way we should be doing it? ... Is there something we're overlooking Are people getting careless?'' <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> said he has found no common thread in the recent spate of accidents. Some were the result of mechanical failure and others came from a lapse of attention to detail or procedure, he said. He said he did not believe that commanders were working their sailors too hard, but that he also wanted to ensure that no short-cuts were being taken during the many dangerous activities that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> must undertake every day. `` A stand-down ... does not say, bring ships in from sea, stop flying airplanes completely. It does say the routine training, administrative functions are secondary to the review of these safety procedures. Clearly, operations around the world must continue,'' <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> said. `` Our prime resonsibility is to ensure that we have a safe working environment around the world, so people come back home to their families safely,'' the admiral said. The action came as the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has suffered through a series of mishaps since Oct. 29 in which 10 people have been killed or lost at sea and at least 45 people injured. Between Jan. 1 and Nov. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> counted 101 `` operation and training related'' fatalities, including 47 in the explosion aboard the USS Iowa on April 19. <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> defended the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s safety record, saying that if the deaths from the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> disaster are not counted, this year would have been the `` safest year in this decade'' in respect to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> accidents. Another <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Lt. Cmdr <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, said commanders will be able to decide when to conduct the 48-hour safety evaluation. `` This is a stand-down, not a shutdown,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said. `` There is no degradation of the readiness posture.'' Overall, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has 599,000 full-time personnel and some 566 ships _ and usually a third of those are at sea for training at any one time. On Tuesday, before the announcement was made at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> F-14 jet fighter crashed in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, with the crew escaping serious injury. In a separate incident, a fire aboard an amphibious assault ship in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, injured 31 people. The fire broke out aboard the USS Inchon while it underwent shipyard maintenance in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. And at <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, a technician was injured when twio grams of an experimental explosive mixture detonated at a laboratory at the Naval Surface Weapons Testing Center. The recent accidents have included a training jet crashing into an aircraft carrier off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, sailors who have been washed overboard on two different aircraft carriers and the accidental bombing of a cruiser in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. In their statement Tuesday, <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told fleet commanders and other senior officers they should `` leave no stone unturned to ensure the safety of operations is foremost in the minds of all hands.'' `` The obligation we have to bring every sailor home safely and husband the scarce resource of combat readiness dictates a hard look at all levels and at every detail,'' the statement said. The order also requires all commanders to report their findings. Rep. <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON>, D-Mo., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said it was a `` very wise move'' on the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s part to review procedures <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> said it is often forgotten that `` even training under the best of circumstances, it can be a dangerous profession.'' Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical materials, also said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s decision was wise, but he complained the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has decided to make Capt <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, skipper of the USS Iowa, eligible for another major command. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Democrat said <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> `` could accomplish the same objective if he did not ... advance people in rank who do n't do a good job.'' The former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said: `` It's important that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people understand that what our <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> does can be dangerous. This is tough stuff. We're going to have accidents, but we try very hard not to. I think ... that attitude is reflected in Adm. <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>'s decision.'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, who retired last month, spoke with reporters as he was visiting in the Pentagon at the time of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement.

 The House on Tuesday approved a bill aimed at reforming management of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and eliminating opportunities for influence-peddling and political favoritism. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agreed by a voice vote to send to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> reform package that includes proposals from Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> as well as others arising from a congressional investigation of the the department's multibillion-dollar scandals. The quick action came after the House Banking subcommittee on housing and community development approved the bill last week and stripped away a larger proposal to revamp federal housing programs. Some Democrats had hoped to keep the two tied together as a way of forcing congressional action on the housing program revision. The bill requires that consultants and lobbyists working on <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs register with the department and identify for whom they are working, and report any fees. Civil penalties would be imposed for those who fail to comply. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> recipients would have to report any use of consultants and lobbyists. The measure creates the new positions of chief financial officer for the department and comptroller of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, to oversee financial management. It includes reforms in the FHA-insured mortgage program, including a prohibition on loans for second homes. The bill includes restrictions on the Section 8 moderate rehabilitation program, which provided subsidies for renovating low-income housing that were at the heart of evidence of influence-peddling and political favoritism in the scandals. The bill limits the number of housing units which may be subsidized per project to 100. It also authorizes $ 25 million for the department to monitor and evaluate its programs _ less than the 0.5 percent of program spending, or about $ 100 million, that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> asked for. The bill also includes provisions aimed at ensuring that housing assistance grants are distributed without political favoritism. It requires allocation on the basis of formulas and need, and requires that the department consider any low-income housing tax credits that may also be available to developers receiving grants. It requires full disclosure of financin decisions, and places restrictions on accounts from which the secretary has discretion to spend. In the case of the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Block </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grants </ORGANIZATION>, it increases form 60 percent to 75 percent the amount of assistance that must be used for projects benefiting the poor. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> had proposed an even tighter requirement. The bill also restricts the administration's ability to fire the department's inspector general.

 The House Education and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted unanimously Tuesday to approve a bill guaranteeing a wide range of rights to disabled Americans, the first House panel to approve the measure since the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed it in September. Three other House committees must approve the bill _ Judiciary, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. The version approved Tuesday was virtually the same as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure, which passed 76-8. Some clarifications were added to the bill, which prevents discrimination against the disabled in employment, public accommodations, public transportation and access to telephone service. The clarifications were the result of bipartisan negotiations, just as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill was the result of negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which had sought to soften timetables and enforcement provisions. The House version clarifies that although rehabilitated drug users are considered disabled and protected under the act, a person who currently uses drugs and is otherwise disabled is not protected. Although the vote Tuesday was unanimous, Republicans unsuccessfully fought to introduce several amendments reflecting concerns of the small business community. When considering the ability of a business that is part of a larger entity to pay for changes required under the law, courts may consider the financial resources of the overall entity, according to one of the clarifications. Also, the House version says that the maximum fine of $ 50,000 for violations of the public accommodations provision applies to all violations that make up a `` pattern and practice'' suit brought by the attorney general, and not an individual violation. Second violations carry a maximum fine of $ 100,000 under the same standard. Lawmakers had been hoping to have a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version passed and a final bill ready for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s signature by Christmas. Such an outcome appears unlikely given the present pace of hearings.

 The race for the Nicaraguan presidency is a dead heat, according to a poll by a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> TV station, with support nearly even for <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and U.S.-backed candidate <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>' pollster suggested that a position by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church, which has suffered years of harassment from the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, could tip the election. In the poll, which was taken at the end of October, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> received 40 percent and <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> 39 percent. Eight other candidates got a total of 5 percent, and 16 percent of the sample of 1,129 voters said it was undecided. The poll had a margin of plus or minus 3 percent. The poll is the first independently sponsored poll among voters registered for the Feb. 25 election that challenges the rule of the Marxist-leaning Sandinistas who have held power since toppling dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in July 1979. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, elected in 1984, seeks another five-year term. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION>, is a coalition of 12 of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s 21 registered parties. <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendixen </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Bendixen </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Schroth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polls </ORGANIZATION>, which did the survey, noted that only 25 percent of those polled consider the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a friend whereas the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> received respective friendship rankings of 66 percent and 70 percent. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-backed Contra fighters seeking to topple the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> also got across-the-board low ratings. He said the numbers tended to hold up even among those who oppose the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Left-wing rebels on Tuesday claimed control of portions of eight of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s 14 provinces and declared they would intensify efforts to seize the entire country. President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said his government is not and was never threatened by the fierce, 3-day-old guerrilla offensive that has turned the capital into a battlefield. Government aircraft rocketed and strafed rebel positions on the northern and eastern perimeters of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and thousands of residents fled the battle zones. At least 503 people have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded across <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> since the guerrillas launched their offensive Saturday night, according to military, hospital and morgue reports. The rebels' <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- issued a communique calling on its forces to `` take control of the whole country,'' but also said it was willing to pursue a `` democratic solution.'' It said local governments would be established in areas held by the rebels. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, a rightist who took office June 1, said government forces have `` neutralized'' insurgents on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s southeastern, southern and western periphery, but that combat continues against rebels on the northern outskirts `` The army is advancing, but advancing slowly,'' he told a news conference. He accused the guerrillas of holding civilians hostage and of using them as screens against army counteroffensives. `` The government was never in danger,'' he said. `` The people stated clearly and out loud that they were not going to support the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. ... There is no danger whatever of the government being toppled.'' The degree of civilian support for the rebels, who have entrenched themselves in several northern and eastern working-class suburbs, is difficult to gauge. Reporters have witnessed what appears to be respectful, even amicable, treatment of the insurgents _ including the giving of food, water and intelligence. But it is unclear if the civilians feel coerced by the presence of hundreds of heavily armed combatants in their neighborhoods. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> denied air force planes and helicopters had bombarded civilian zones where the guerrillas are entrenched. But Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Larios </PERSON>, minister of defense, virtually contradicted the president when, at the same news conference, he acknowledged that helicopters have fired rockets at guerrilla positions. Associated Press reporters and photographers in northern and eastern sections of the city were able to visit rebel-held zones and saw air attacks. Nearly 100 civilians have been killed and more than 680 wounded in this capital since the fighting began, many of them reportedly casualties of air attacks. Thousands of others have fled the battle zones. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told an afternoon news conference in the capital, `` It is not a situation that is any means stable as yet.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> was `` pulling out all the stops'' in the offensive but failing to achieve either its political or military objectives. Rebels with light anti-tank weapons attacked a national police unit near his residence during the night but they were repelled by troops, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. A guerrilla leader who uses the pseudonym <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON> said, `` It's a new kind of war that could lead to the end of the war.'' He spoke with <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in a rebel-controlled district in the capital's northern neighborhood of <LOCATION> Zacamil </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> leaders ordered the offensive after announcing they would not participate in peace talks sceduled for Nov. 20-21 in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. They said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s rightist government was not negotiating seriously and blamed it for the Oct. 31 bombing of a union headquarters that killed 10 people and wounded 29. Two Americans were among the wounded. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> is under a rebel-declared traffic ban, a state of siege and 6 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew. The army ordered a 24-hour curfew on embattled districts in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. U.S.-supplied Skymaster propeller planes were seen firing rockets at residential areas in <LOCATION> Zacamil </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Soyapango </LOCATION>, an eastern suburb of the capital. Helicopter gunships strafed rebel-held positions. Some neighborhoods were sealed off by government troops but in other districts there were only rebel units. In <LOCATION> Zacamil </LOCATION>, where five-story apartment buildings rise above squatters' shacks, the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> contingent was led by <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabindranath </PERSON> <PERSON> Armijo </PERSON>, who uses the war name Commander <PERSON> Chico </PERSON>. Some fighters were as young as 13, carrying AK-47 assault rifles. <PERSON> Armijo </PERSON> was accompanied by a one-armed communications officer with a field radio. Although the rebels' military domination of <LOCATION> Zacamil </LOCATION> was solid, their political control was not. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of residents remained in the neighborhood, aiding the guerrillas, but hundreds of others fled the community. <PERSON> Armijo </PERSON> said rebel commanders were trying to persuade the people to support them but those who did n't were free to leave. Col. <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, an armed forces spokesman, described the residents of northern suburbs as hostages of `` terrorist elements.'' He said as of Tuesday morning 309 guerrillas had been killed, 160 wounded and 60 captured. He gave military casualties as 106 killed and 231 wounded. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said the military had counted 17 civilians killed and 86 wounded throughout the couuntry. But hospitals and morgues reported 88 civilians killed and 662 wounded only in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> since the offensive began. In a broadcast on the rebels' clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> declared parts of eight provinces `` liberated zones.'' It said local governments would be established in areas of <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Usulutan </LOCATION>, Cuscatlan, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vicente </LOCATION> and Cabanas provinces. The guerrillas have controlled areas in those provinces for years. <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> leaders have said in the past they could not expect a battlefield victory over the U.S.-backed government. They have an estimated 7,000 guerrillas and 11,000 irregulars fighting the government's 56,000-member security forces. The Salvadoran conflict has taken 70,000 lives the last decade.

 The lone elected black on <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s city commission won overwhelming support from black voters to defeat his Cuban-born challenger in Tuesday's runoff elections. With 86 of 86 precincts reporting and absentee ballots counted, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, 64, a two-term incumbent, had 18,245 votes, or 52.7 percent, to 16,402 votes, or 47.3 percent, for <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>. Totals from ethnic-dominated precincts in this racially tense city showed <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> carrying nearly 99 percent of the black vote and 75 percent of the `` Anglo'' vote, while <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON> carried the largest bloc, Hispanics, with 78 percent. <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> had said he did n't believe his was `` the black seat,'' but he also said the city's blacks _ with about 30 percent of the voters _ deserved representation on the commission. <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>, 34, a former commissioner, ran Spanish-language ads that suggested `` all the Cubans vote for <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>.'' In the other race, former commissioner <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 44, failed to regain the seat she resigned this summer against <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON>, 48. Ms. <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON>, riding heavy Hispanic support, had 17,561 votes, or 53.1 percent, to 15,461 votes, or 46.8 percent, for Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, an administrator at <ORGANIZATION> Miami-Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, led a six-candidate primary Nov. 7 by 691 votes over <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>. `` Black Seat in Jeopardy'' was the front-page headline in The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, a black-oriented weekly newspaper. <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> was supported by some Hispanic leaders who said it was important symbolically to have at least one black on the commission. <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>, a former police officer who served two terms on the commission before losing the 1987 election, ran a slashing campaign that linked <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> with a drug trafficker and called him the worst commissioner in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> history. In his fiery years on the commission, <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON> often brought his anti-Communism into commission debates. Some key Cuban-American leaders had backed Cuban-born attorney <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurre </PERSON> in his 1987 defeat of <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>. Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, easily re-elected last week to a new four year-term, called <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON> disruptive and supported <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurre </PERSON> and `` Anglo'' J.L. <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> will be up for re-election in two years. The mayor also sits on the commission. Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> charged Ms. <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> with `` a penchant for demagoguery.'' Her commercials called Ms. <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> `` an opportunist who does not respect the law,'' a reference to a 1988 court decision that knocked Ms. <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON> off the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> commission ballot because of a residency violation. Ms. <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> populist, concentrated her campaign among Hispanic voters. She led the six-candidate primary by 235 votes. <PERSON> Athalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Range </PERSON>, who is black, was picked as interim commissioner after Ms. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s resignation. She did not seek election to a full term. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s 104,232 registered voters for the nonpartisan races included 44,034 foreign-born Hispanics _ estimates of all Hispanics range to 50 percent _ 32,021 blacks and 28,199 non-Latin whites, or Anglos.

 A fire broke out aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> carrier Tuesday, injuring 31 people on the same day the service ordered its ships and planes to halt normal operations for 48 hours due to a string of accidents. The fire aboard the helicopter carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inchon </ORGANIZATION>, which was in a shipyard for routine repairs, was the ninth serious accident involving <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships and planes in the past three weeks. In another accident Tuesday, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> F-14 Tomcat fighter went down 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, while on a routine training mission, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The two fliers parachuted to safety. The fire aboard the <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION> was reported at 9:30 a.m. in the shore power cable compartment, where lines supplying power to the ship enter from the pier, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>. The fire was extinguished within 10 minutes with help from the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which was docked nearby, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said. The fire was contained in the compartment, but the helicopter carrier's hangar deck sustained smoke and heat damage, he said Twenty-three sailors who helped fight the fire and eight civilians were taken to six hospitals for smoke inhalation, the spokesman said. Nine were admitted, and the rest were treated and released. One man was in serious condition with smoke-inhalation burns at <ORGANIZATION> Sentara-Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, a hospital spokeswoman. The 602-foot <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION> has a crew of 675 and can carry up to 2,000 Marines and 20 helicopters. The crash of the F-14 occurred around 1 p.m., Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> said at Naval Air Station Key West.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> failing marks as the `` education president'' Tuesday and accused him of blocking the education secretary from doing a good job. Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., acknowledged to reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, `` I feel rather presumptive in grading the president but I've been asked to do so. He then launched into harsh criticisms of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who pledged to become the `` education president'' if elected. `` There is not a single accomplishment, initiative, or educational credit with which the president can be identified, even if the summit is so regarded,'' said <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, referring to the recent two-day meeting of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the nation's governors that resulted in a push for national performance goals. However, <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> was kinder to Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, noting `` he and I are very, very friendly.'' `` I think he's a fine, honorable man. I think he has good motives,'' said <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>. `` I think that if he was not restrained, he probably would do very well. I think under the restraints, he ca n't.'' <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> is being hampered by policies pushed by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which `` I think differ diametrically from his own philosophy.'' `` I think he's trying to do a good job in a very desperate sort of way but will not be able to succeed because he has to accept the policies of the administration,'' said <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, who predicted <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> would not complete his term at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Asked about concrete accomplishments of <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said, `` I do n't know of any.'' Replying to <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said in a statement: `` The remarks made are unfounded and the allegations misleading, at a time when the national urgently needs a constructive dialogue between the administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The president knows that this nation faces a dangerous education deficit and we are determined to directly confront the gravity of the situation. Business as usual will not suffice. `` The president and I have proposed a far-reaching education agenda for this nation. We have invigorated the education debate across this country ... I take great honor and consider it a privilege to serve President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' As for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said, `` I am afraid the president's record is an embarrassing ` 0 for 4.''' He pointed to the administration's efforts to push the concept of allowing parents toselect the school their children will attend, even though parental choice has not been `` adequately debated, legislated or evaluated. `` The administration is promoting choice to replace full funding and implementation of current federal elementary and secondary education programs, as embodied in the School Improvement Act of 1988,'' he said. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> also cited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto of the education appropriations bill, which he said would have enabled 1 million additional disadvantaged children to improve their reading and math skills. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed the legislation because it contained an expansion of abortion funding that he opposed. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrat also criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for excluding from the summit educators, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and representatives from business, teachers and parents.

 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday objected to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans to deploy Marines near the U.S.-Mexican border in anti-drug operations. `` The Mexican government wants to make clear that it does not share in _ nor support _ the measures announced yesterday -LRB- Monday -RRB- by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regarding the use of the armed forces in a location close to the shared border,'' the ministry said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> announced on Monday the formation of a military intelligence center at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bliss </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, that reports said would use 75 U.S. Marines in border drug-patrol operations. El Paso is across the border from the Mexican city of <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Mexican governments have established effective cooperation in the war against drugs, but <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s `` decision made unilaterally'' could have negative repercussions along the border. It did not elaborate on the possible effects. `` The Mexican government recognizes the sovereign right of all nations to institute measures in accord with their national interests in their respective territories,'' the statement said. `` However, the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government believes that among neighbors, especially in friendly countries, mutual consultation is prudent for both sides.'' Meanwhile, the attorney general's office announced four Colombians were arrested and 1,320 pounds of cocaine and $ 2 million were seized by police at a small airstrip near <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>. At a news conference Tuesday, the attorney general's office identified one of the suspects as <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> and said he recently was released from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prison after serving a sentence for drug-related charges. Authorities gave this account of the incident that occurred Sunday: Police detained <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgos </PERSON> when they met the pilot and co-pilot of a Turbo Commander airplane that arrived from Cali, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Pilot <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> <PERSON> Valderrama </PERSON> and co-pilot <PERSON> Edinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Tosse </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> also were arrested at the paved landing strip near <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state's main north-south highway. The cocaine was to be transferred to the two men waiting for the plane for shipment to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgos </PERSON> had arrived at the airfield in a pickup truck, inspected the landing area and hid in underbrush. Some hours later, when the plane flew over, the two men directed its landing and began to unload packets of cocaine. Police, in position because of information about the planned transaction, moved in, making the arrests and seizing the cocaine and money.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a bill Tuesday making <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s abortion laws the toughest in the nation, as the first state to take advantage of greater authority allowed by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The bill, approved on a 33-17 vote and passed three weeks ago by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, goes to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership Wednesday for a formal signature, then to Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, who has said he would sign it. Pro-choice forces introduced nine amendments in an attempt to delay its passage and soften its effects. But all the amendments were defeated within five hours, and the legislation was approved about half an hour later. `` It's a big win, it's a big margin, it's great,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Freind </PERSON>, the Republican who drafted the bill and guided it through the House. Pro-choice senators said the legislation would trample on women's rights while setting the stage for another court challenge to abortion. `` It's a shame, a national disgrace,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fumo </PERSON>, a Democrat. The bill would require women to notify their husbands if they plan to get an abortion; prohibit abortions because of the fetus' sex; ban abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy, except in cases where the mother faces death or irreversible harm, and establish a 24-hour waiting period. The proposal also would regulate the medical use of tissue from aborted fetuses. Doctors would be required to inform a woman of the likely age of the fetus before performing an abortion and explain the risks and alternatives. The bill was approved just two weeks after voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> elected governors who succeeded in winning their races partly because of their pro-choice positions. Both candidates made abortion a campaign issue. Last month, an attempt by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> to restrict abortion fell flat when the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> rejected a package of bills. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate was suspended less than half an hour after it began when legislators voted 26-24 to suspend rules and allow amendments. Republican and Democratic caucuses held private meetings on the bill. Debate resumed two hours later. An amendment to make a technical change and another to allow some exceptions to a proposed ban on abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy were the first to be defeated. Other rejected amendments included proposals for a statewide referendum on the bill, eliminating a requirement that wives notify husbands before ending a pregnanacy and revising the waiting period so that women living at least 50 miles from a clinic would have to make only one trip. Had any of the amendments passed, the legislation would have been returned to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which would have had to agree to any changes. At noon, the Capitol rotunda was filled with more than 100 anti-abortion protesters who held a prayer vigil and sang religious songs. The vigil was organized by members of a home for unwed mothers. The state chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> delivered petitions to the governor's office with 50,000 signatures and hand-written letters opposing further restrictions on abortion. In a July decision upholding a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> gave states more leeway to restrict abortions. If the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> bill is enacted, it would be first to take advantage of that ruling by setting tighter controls on abortion. Opponents of the bill have described it as unconstitutional. Supporters say the bill places reasonable restrictions on abortions while providing an avenue for further challenges to the landmark <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision that established abortion a constitutional right in 1973.

<HEAD>End Of Trail On Horizon For Church ``Tepee''</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>

 At a distance or up close, it looks like a tall Indian tepee. It was designed that way. But it's a church. It has served its congregation for nearly 40 years. But its day seems done. In this state named for the `` red people,'' the unusual but aptly shaped structure, built to reflect its natural environment, may be destined for eradication due to blows by nature itself. `` We realize it's a landmark,'' says Connie Golden, the church secretary. `` We hate to see it go, but we've been frustrated in maintaining it. The leaking, the flooding, the special problems in repairs, all kinds of things. `` The upkeep was simply phenomenal.'' The tepee church, once called the wigwam, stands on the city's northwestern outskirts at 178th and <LOCATION> MacArthur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> on the boundary with suburban <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> and its outlying oil derricks Formerly a Southern Baptist church, it became non-denominational about five years ago, called simply the Church at Edmond. Early this fall, slammed variously by the elements, the congregation moved out. `` New folks like the uniqueness of it and older folks have a lot of sentiment about it, but they see the impracticalities of maintaining it,'' says the pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>. `` People who understand the problem, who have lived with that thing, know why we have to give it up,'' he added in an interview. `` We get mad at it sometimes.'' Built in the late 1940's, the ` tepee'' was designed by the late innovative architect <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Goff </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Architecture </ORGANIZATION> from 1947 to 1955 and planner of several striking buildings. It stands about 80 feet tall, height of a four-story building, its conical shape converging in a peak, the sloping gray-shingled surface surmounted by 12 russet-painted steel poles -LRB- welded drill-stem pipes from the oil fields -RRB-. They were named for the 12 apostles. Lore has it that the one named for the betrayer <PERSON> Judas </PERSON> was hardest to erect. Their convergence at the top is enclosed by 12 triangular windows. Above rises legs of an open bell tower with no bell. The base is wrapped with native rock and sheet metal over a circular basement for nursery and classrooms. The round sanctuary, with pews ringed before the raised podium, was a precursor of later churches-in-the-round. Constructed by members themselves, working Saturdays and weekday evenings over four years from 1947 to 1951, the oddly formed church was meant to express its natural setting _ Indians, oil fields and rural touches. `` Back then the design was pretty controversial,'' recalled <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who was a young boy in the `` tepee's'' early days, climbing with other church children among its interior nooks, rocks and webbed braces. `` But the people then evidently went for it,'' he added. However, for all its fittingly novel features, it just did n't function well The strange peak, with its merging poles and triangular windows at the apex always leaked some, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> says, little or much, depending on the rain's force. <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>'s extra rains last summer multiplied the trouble, dousing basement rooms, the runoff infiltrating the septic system. The building had no insulation, and in the winter could n't be warmed above 50 degrees, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` Utilities were out of sight,'' he added. `` We could n't afford to heat it or cool it. In repairs, you're not dealing with the average building, but always with different sizes and spaces. There's nothing standard about it. `` I'd love to see the building saved, but we just ca n't do anything with it.'' The congregation of about 200 has moved its worship services into an adjacent metal building, with sanctuary and fellowship hall, and a concrete-block education building. Since word of the tepee's evacuation got out, some historical conservationists, including some from other countries, have voiced interest in saving it, but no definite plans for that have emerged. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said that unless some foundation or group acts to preserve the `` tepee,'' he anticipated that it would be torn down within a year, and the space used as a church parking lot. Yet some both in the congregation and outside it remain attached to the `` tepee,'' despite the inroads of nature, sometimes including birds fluttering about inside. `` When you get accustomed to it, the uniqueness of it, people generally love it,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` The wider community also is proud of it and hates to see it go.'' But he added that it's so different it does n't work. `` It expands and contracts so much,'' he said. `` It's inefficient in a lot of other ways There's no big, burning desire to tear it down, but we do n't know what else to do with it.''

<HEAD>Small-Business Survey Shows Economic Growth Surprisingly Strong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The outlook for business conditions improved substantially in the latest quarterly survey of small businesses, suggesting that economic growth could be surprisingly strong for the rest of the year. The survey found unexpected strength in job creation and an improvement in the inflation picture during the third quarter, but only slight improvement in short-term borrowing conditions. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, who interprets results for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, said responses leave the threat of recession something that `` at best, is likely to occur only in the murky 1990 future.'' <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s school of business and management, said the survey revealed more companies now expect improved economic conditions over the next six months than expect a deterioration. The more confident tone of the report showed up clearly in what the Federation calls its Small Business Optimism Index, which rose from 99.8 in the third quarter to 102.1 points in the latest analysis. The index, which uses 1978 as its benchmark -LRB- 100 -RRB-, incorporates responses about existing and anticipated business conditions. As such, it measures responses about current job openings, satisfaction with the condition of inventories, changes in net earnings, plans to hire and make capital outlays, expected business conditions and expected sales. The lowest seasonally adjusted index since its formulation in 1974 was an 81.1 reading in the second quarter of 1980. Its highest level was reached in the first quarter of 1984 at 108.7. The index, which is widely followed because of its sound forecasting record over the years, relies on detailed, written responses from close to 2,000 members of the federation. In the latest survey, 1,797 responses were studied. The federation claims over 500,000 member firms, ranging from extremely small enterprises such as proprietorships to companies with sales in the hundreds of millions _ small only in relationship to the very largest firms. The community it represents, says <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, employs half the private nonfarm work force and produces about 50 percent of the nation's gross private product. Smaller companies, it is felt by some economic forecasters, are especially sensitive to changing economic conditions. Studying the responses, <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> said that only 25 percent of companies in the survey planned to raise prices, a 5-point drop from the first quarter of 1989, `` a remarkable turnaround in inflation pressures in the economy.'' He saw little inflation threat in the strong demand for workers, saying `` there is still little evidence that compensation is responding in any substantive way to labor market tightness.'' While labor costs are rising, he said, the gains are n't alarming `` Indeed, gains remain surprisingly modest,'' he said, while conceding that a higher minimum wage could have a ripple effect on the wage structure. The tightening of labor markets shown by the latest survey was in contrast to what <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> said was a period of substantial weakening since January. He termed the strength unexpected, and said much of it was in the service sector. Little change was found in plans for capital investments. `` All in all, no excitement, just steady spending,'' he said, but he indicated that it might begin easing soon. That easing, he said, would result from companies waiting to see just which course the economy is taking. `` So far, the signals remain mixed, and the economy stays on an even keel.''

 Americans foresee fewer smokers, better schools and more cash in their wallets in the coming decade, but they expect pollution, crime and drug abuse to worsen, a national poll has found. On balance, most respondents to the <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll expressed general optimism for the 1990s. About six in 10 expected life for others to improve, and three-quarters saw their own lives getting better. Education was the brightest spot, with 58 percent expecting it to improve in the next decade. Personal wealth also was a point of optimism, with 56 percent expecting their family's financial situation to improve. But the poll's 1,071 respondents divided about evenly on whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy will improve, worsen or remain about the same. And half expected the federal budget deficit to worsen, while just a fifth saw it improving. The survey found sobering assessments on many other issues. More than six in 10 expected pollution and crime to worsen, and almost as many saw more AIDS, homelessness and world hunger as the year 2000 approaches. The environment stood out as a chief concern. Twelve percent expected pollution to be the nation's greatest problem a decade from now; only drug abuse was named by more, 17 percent. Moreover, 65 percent expected pollution to worsen in the next 10 years, and almost half said the warming of the atmosphere because of pollution, known as the greenhouse effect, could threaten human survival. Pessimism often was greatest among younger respondents, and in many cases optimism increased with age. Fifty-two percent of those aged 18-24 expected the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to become involved in a war in the 1990s; just 41 percent of their elders shared their fear. And among the oldest group, over 64 years old, just 27 percent expected war. Similarly, six in 10 in the youngest group expected drug abuse to worsen and two-thirds of them saw acquired immune deficiency syndrome as a growing problem, while nearer to half of the older respondents agreed. One of the most widely held expectations overall was for a Democrat to win the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which 72 percent called likely. Among the least-expected developments: the demise of communism, considered likely by just 26 percent. Other widely expected eventualities were cigarette smokers shrinking to a tiny minority of the population, which 59 percent called likely; and much greater restrictions on abortion, expected by 56 percent. The poll found a lowering of some expectations in the past decade. In a 1979 survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, 51 percent expected the four-day work week to become common in the 1980s; when the question was repeated in the new poll, just 41 percent held that view for the 1990s. Fewer people expected new energy sources to end dependency on oil _ 49 percent now, compared with 60 percent in 1979. And more expected the role of nuclear power to decline _ 45 percent now, compared with 33 percent 10 years ago. More also were dubious that racial and religious discrimination could largely disappear _ 77 percent said not, compared with 66 percent in 1979. In both polls, nine in 10 doubted that poverty would be almost eliminated. Among other possibilities posed for the 1990s, 37 percent said it was likely the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would control <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>; 38 percent expected a woman to be elected president; 42 percent called it likely <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> astronauts will reach Mars; and 42 percent expected cures for cancer and for AIDS. The poll, conducted by telephone Sept. 14-24, had a margin of error of 3 percentage points. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews Sept. 14-24 with 1,071 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday, a random phenomenon. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of 20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if every adult American were asked the same questions. The error margin is larger for subgroups. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100: 1. What do you think will be the most important problem facing this country 10 years from now? Drugs: 17 percent.

<TEXT>
 She's hip, she's brutally honest, often bawdy and always witty. Poet <PERSON> Maralyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Polak </PERSON> writes about personal pain, but says the real point of her writing is to reveal `` global pain, cosmic pain, and human pain.'' She published her first poem, an ode to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, at the age of 7 in a local newspaper, and has been seriously writing poetry since she was 15. Since 1974, she's written a weekly celebrity interview column for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Polak </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, is from a strictly working-class background. `` My father was a high school dropout who became an electrical engineer,'' she says. `` My parents did n't go to museums or concerts. They were Jewish and revered the idea of learning _ they were smart, but not intellectual.'' When her father took his lunch to work, he carried the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in his box instead of a Thermos. `` I learned about sex and life from tabloid newspapers,'' she says. She attended <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on a scholarship. When she broke into journalism, she faced her first battle with envy. `` Everyone went to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Radcliffe </PERSON>, and I developed a crushing inferiority complex. It was the worst insecurity I ever had, and I could n't do a thing about it,'' she says. That feeling passed when her poetry was noticed by a publisher looking for a poet with working-class roots. `` I was cured of my Ivy envy,'' she says. `` I realized that people who went to great schools were n't necessarily happier or better educated than I was.'' Writing about personal pain, or `` hangnails of the soul,'' as she calls it, is trivial, but writing about human pain is more important. `` It's not enough to write about what's going on around you,'' she says. Some poets, she says, face problems with the mundaneness of life and their own self-absorption. `` Your material is limited unless you're always listening to the voices of other people,'' she says. The academic world of poetry also bothers her. `` Poems have to be accessible and written in the language of the people,'' she says. `` I do n't like academic anything. I want my work to be multi-layered, but direct and eloquent, not pretentious.'' Her poems deal with politics, injustice, sex and relationships, but she does n't consciously write about those issues. `` One of the reasons I write is to give voice to the voiceless, to express the unspeakable. Sometimes you write for yourself, sometimes you write about the larger human condition.'' <PERSON> Polak </PERSON>'s inner struggles also manifest themselves in her writing. `` I struggle with the unequal balance of power between people,'' she says. `` That sums up everything _ men and women, countries, governments.'' Her concerns are also personal. `` I worry about ` why did n't that man call me back?''' She laughs. But when her father was left alone at the age of 82 after her mother died, and a relative contracted AIDS, her concerns changed. `` I worry about what will happen to people with AIDS, to old people,'' she says. `` I worry about what it means to be a good daughter and a good human being, about where does one person's struggle end and another person's begin, about the limits of responsibility. She rages that American society is unaware of important issues. `` We're asleep in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The middle class has conquered. We're numb, we're being entertained, and horrible things are happening everywhere,'' she says Journalism reflects that apathy, with the emphasis the media place on lifestyle stories, she says. `` That's how our lives have become,'' she says. `` Those are non-stories about non-issues. They're about non-people going to non-events and having non-thoughts.'' Poetry, however, should wake people up, she says. `` I want a poem to come up to you, grab you by the throat, put a gun to your head and say, ` Pay attention to me.' If people become safe and smug, we have to shake'em up a little.'' Such works as `` The Death Squad in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>,'' which compares a mythical death squad similar to those in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries existing in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, and `` A Tastefully Clean Poem for the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>,'' a work against censorship that literally `` blanks'' out its obscene words but is still obscene, reflect her more jarring poems. Her poetry and her journalism have to be kept separate, she says. `` The two do fertilize and enrich each other. I'm better as a poet because of my zest for detail, and my writing as a journalist is more vibrant because of my ability to take risks with words.'' The rewards she gains from both also differ. `` The reward of poetry is the poem. The reward of journalism is being part of people's daily lives.''

<HEAD>Mexican Agriculture in Deep Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MAZATEPEC, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 From small rice farms in <LOCATION> Mazatepec </LOCATION> to vast fields in fertile valleys, Mexican agriculture is withering in the winds of economic crisis. `` The crisis is very real and it's a very serious crisis,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barkin </PERSON>, an agricultural economist with the Ecodevelopment Center in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` It is affecting all the basic food producers in this country. It is n't profitable.'' That is acutely evident to <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON> <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON>, who grows rice on 3.7 acres in <LOCATION> Mazatepec </LOCATION>, 45 miles south of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. To get through the last growing season he had to borrow the equivalent of $ 469 and still wound up with a $ 142 loss on his crop. A farm union leader said such losses or lean profits have encouraged some farmers to plant more profitable, but illegal, marijuana and opium poppies. One of the few bright spots, however, has been exports, mostly of tomatoes, other vegetables and fruits to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which amounted to about $ 2.4 billion in 1988. To broaden that market, the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government has asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to lower barriers to a range of agricultural products from avocadoes to watermelons despite possible objections from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers. After powering the country's growth for 20 years, agriculture overall faded into the shadow of industrialization and urbanization in the mid-1960s. The population doubled, to 85 million today, but food production has n't kept up. To avoid shortages, more grains, meat and other foods are imported. City dwellers eat tortillas made from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> yellow corn and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is the world's largest importer of powdered milk. The decline has worsened in the last seven years. Austerity imposed to help service <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s $ 107 billion foreign debt and an even larger domestic debt has dried up investment. `` Everyone has suffered. Agriculture has suffered more,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shwedel </PERSON>, an agricultural economist and regional director in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Dam and irrigation-system construction has stalled. Cracks and pumps are n't repaired. Financing for research to improve crops, livestock and technology has dwindled, along with farm credit. Crop prices have been held within anti-inflation guidelines to calm urban consumers, while interest rates and prices of fertilizer, insecticides and equipment have ballooned. The interest on rice-farmer <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON> <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON>'s $ 469 loan was $ 391 and was a key factor in his loss. Far to the northwest in the rich <LOCATION> Yaqui </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bernabe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who manages several agro-industrial cooperatives, says many soybean farmers did n't plant this year because of low farm prices. `` I read what the president said, that prices were n't going up, and costs are going up, so I did n't want to plant,'' he said. His 70 acres lay idle. The immediate financial problems overlie deeper ones _ the uncertainty of land tenure under <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s agrarian reform system and corruption and bureaucratic snarls in everything from who gets the land to water rights, credit and marketing. `` In the Mexican countryside we are facing the greatest challenge of economic modernization,'' President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> said in his state of the nation address Nov. 1. In 1988, crop production shrank 4.5 percent, the third consecutive year or reduced or flat production, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>. This year is expected to be no better, analysts say. The figure contrasts with an average annual growth rate of 6.1 percent from 1940 to 1960. Food imports, which amounted to 8.5 million tons last year, are expected to reach 9.5 million tons this year and again in 1990; production of basic grains is expected to be around 22 million tons. Analysts put the cost of imports at $ 2.5 billion to $ 3.5 billion in long-term, low interest loans, more than the government will save in its debt reduction agreement with foreign banks. As for the farmer, `` Two serious things are happening,'' said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autonomous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campesino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>. `` They are leaving land unplanted and some are planting illegal drugs. This is profitable.'' Another campesino leader said that in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast state of <LOCATION> Guerrero </LOCATION>, 2.5 acres of corn can bring in $ 400 for five months' work, while one-hundredth of that area planted in marijuana produces $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 Planted in opium poppies it would bring $ 20,000. Seventy percent of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s cultivated land is in ejidos, farmland given to groups of peasants to work and pass on to their children. Selling it is illegal. So is renting, although it is common. Critics of the ejido system blame it for low production, saying that the land has been broken up into mini-plots and that private land ownership offers more incentives and results in more investment as well as reduced corruption. Government officials say <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' policy of selling publicly held companies wont' t extend to the ejido system, a fundamental reform of the 1910-21 Mexican But they have said mini-plots should be avoided. Defenders of the system say that with good land and inputs, ejidos produce as well as private holdings. `` The disappearance of the ejido would lead to a reconcentration of land and an increase in unemployment, migration to the cities and to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said agricultural economist <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Calva </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> got a taste recently of what winter might bring this year and they did n't like it. Moslem guerrillas fighting the government closed the main road to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for 10 days, sending food and fuel prices up almost 50 percent in the capital. Sugar and cooking oil disappeared from the markets. Cars vanished from the streets. On the 10th day, government forces reopened the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway and trucks rolled in with flour and gasoline. But the lesson was not lost on what most likely in store for the cold, snowy months ahead. `` It's going to be a tough time, worse than last year,'' said <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Mountain </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, said if the war goes on poor people could starve. Last winter a bustling black market blossomed around the Soviet military. Troops sold fuel and flour to Afghans and some Afghans made small fortunes trafficking in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> arms, bought from the soldiers eager for foreign currency. Still, many people spent their days cold and hungry in a city blanketed in snow. In February, the Soviet troops went home, and with them went an important source of goods and cash. Now despite a Soviet aid program that in six months has sent 266,543 metric tons of goods overland and thousands more by air, the economy is getting worse as winter closes in. Prices are already higher than they were in February, a bad sign since food costs in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are traditionally lower in autumn when it is harvested. A 15-pound sack of flour has almost doubled to the equivalent of $ 4 and by the end of winter, merchants estimate, it could hit $ 10, which is more than many people earn in a month. Sugar, another staple in the Afghan diet, also has skyrocketed to more than $ 1 a pound. Tea, the third most important item, has tripled in price. Women defy the 10 p.m.-3 a.m. curfew and spend nights outside bakeries to ensure a loaf or two of bread in the morning. `` I am poor,'' said one elderly woman as she fixed her straw mattress outside one store as the curfew approached. `` My husband and I need to eat and there is no other way to get bread.'' Despite the inflated prices, salaries remain low. The average monthly wage hovers between $ 5 and $ 12.50. For many in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, desperation has become a way of life. <PERSON> Omari </PERSON> <PERSON> Mir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> runs a photo shop in a small house with mud walls in the old city. His whole family works in the shop and they make about $ 45 a month. Because they run a private bsiness, the family receives no government assistance. `` I've got seven mouths to feed,'' <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> said, motioning around his room, suddenly darkened by one of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s frequent blackouts. `` How will I get by?'' At <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a student wearing florescent pink lipstick and bright white shoes told of her two brothers who were killed by a rocket as they flew their kites. `` Tell the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> to send two big bombs to blow us up all at once,'' she said. `` We are sick of dying in bits and bits and pieces. Let us die together.'' Since rocket attacks were stepped up in June, <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanin </PERSON>, a prominent editor, has barely allowed his children out of the house. So far about 400 people have been killed. `` When I look into their eyes, it is difficult for me to bear it,'' he said. `` We are losing a generation. This is the sorrow of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' If there is hope here, perhaps it resides in the traditional center of life _ the bazaar. There, men with brown, weathered faces, gray beards, green eyes and turbans on their heads hawk dried yogurt, grapes and succulent melons. Behind a row of buildings lies the grain market. In one corner sits <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nair </PERSON>, a grizzled merchant. `` The governmnt is coming to us on its knees,'' he said. `` They say they need our help. Only the bazaar will feed the people. Communism has failed.'' In the past few months, the government has returned an unprecedented amount of economic power to the market in an effort to bring food to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. It ended a monopoly on the transportation of fuel and sugar, relaxed already feeble currency trading regulations and dropped import restrictions and tariffs. Anything can be bought in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> by those with money to pay for them: portable tape players from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, Italian leather goods, Soviet and Iranian caviar, expensive French perfumes and tea from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Many goods are re-exported through the black market to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which have tighter import controls. In addition, the government has gone so far as to assure traffickers who bring stolen goods to market that they should not fear prosecution. `` Since all this is aimed at peaceful activity, then we support it,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> <PERSON> Misaq </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` It is better than rockets.'' But, then, as he spoke the first heavy snows had settled on the mountains ringing his city.

<TEXT>
 Were it not for one violent day in 1985, <PERSON> Evelina </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> would be like countless other black South African women: an illiterate maid in her 50s, raised in a isolated farming district, mother of 10. Today, she is the only woman on Death Row _ alone, confused and ill. Her prison cell in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> is the farthest she's ever been from home. `` She can not eat, she ca n't sleep,'' said her lawyer, <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. `` It's a very dramatic thing to say, but I used to think to myself that she's just going to die of a broken heart.'' Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> and 13 men were sentenced to death in May for the mob killing in November 1985 of a black policeman, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Paballelo </LOCATION>, the black section of the remote northwestern town of <LOCATION> Upington </LOCATION>. Twenty-six people were tried for the killing, and four men were found to have physically contributed to the death of <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON>, who was chased from his home, stoned, beaten and set afire. In addition to those four, Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> and nine others were convicted of murder under the doctrine of `` common purpose,'' which holds them responsible because they were part of the crowd that sought to kill <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON>'s death occurred at a time of nationwide black unrest. Hours before he was slain several thousand blacks gathered at a soccer field in <LOCATION> Paballelo </LOCATION> to protest rent increases and other grievances. After police dispersed the crowd with tear gas, about 300 people re-grouped around <LOCATION> Sethwala </LOCATION>'s home and threw stones to force him outside. Militant blacks have frequently attacked black policemen, accusing them of collaborating with the government and its apartheid policies. Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> and her common-law husband, who also has been sentenced to death, were identified as having thrown stones at <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON>'s house. According to the state's evidence, she allegedly yelled: `` The dog is in the house. Bring him out and burn him alive.'' Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> testified during the trial that she and her husband went back to their own house after the protest meeting was broken up and were not present at <LOCATION> Sethwala </LOCATION>'s home. Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON>, who had no previous criminal record and worked for the same white family for 30 years, has little understanding of what is happening to her, Ms. <PERSON> Durbach </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> suffers from arthritis, heart disease and has high blood pressure, the lawyer said. She does not know in what city her prison is and thinks she's been imprisoned for at least a year, when in fact it has been six months. She sees her husband for 30 minutes, once a month. They are separated by a window and communicate through microphones. Only three of her 10 children have been able to visit her, Ms. <PERSON> Durbach </PERSON> said. Because she can not read and is too ill to exercise, Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> does little but listen to government-run radio that is piped into her cell, said Ms. <PERSON> Durbach </PERSON>, who visits her every three weeks. She has been treated well by the prison staff and has developed a good relationship with one of the guards, Ms. <PERSON> Durbach </PERSON> added. A judge ruled in September that the 14 people sentenced to death could appeal their sentences, but a bail request for Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON> was turned down. Two psychologists testified at her bail application that she had suffered mental and physical deterioration, including memory loss, since her imprisonment. Ms. <PERSON> Durbach </PERSON> said no date has been set for the appeal, but she hopes it could be early next year. In a similar mob killing, the Appeal Court, the country's highest court, last year upheld under the `` common purpose'' doctrine the death sentence of six blacks known as the `` Sharpeville Six. However, after a storm of domestic and international protest, then-President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> commuted their death sentences to lengthy prison terms. The last woman to be executed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 25, who was of mixed race. She was hanged in June after being convicted of joining her boyfriend in the brutal knife murder of a teen-ager. More than 50 people, mostly black, have been executed so far this year, and more than 100 were hanged in each of the previous three years. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and his successor, F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, have commuted 54 death sentences this year.

<DATELINE>LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Emy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonhoeffer </PERSON> remembers everything about the moment in 1945 when she realized her husband, <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON>, would die for his involvement in the Christian resistance to <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s fascist regime and his extermination of Jews Among 36 people interviewed for a video archive in <LOCATION> Lynchburg </LOCATION>, she said she was sitting with her husband in the ruins of their bombed house in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> when she exhaled a puff of cigarette smoke, turned to <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> and asked for the first time: `` How will it be when you are arrested?'' Her husband's words, as she recounts, were: `` It will be like a lion passed through and devoured myself and all that I have.'' <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonhoeffer </PERSON>, a member of the `` Confessing Church'' that was set up in the crisis by church leaders to resist Nazism, told her she could do nothing to prevent his demise. She related, `` He said, ` Perhaps you can preserve your life and our children, and, if you can, let them know that their father did not do nothing.''' A few months later, <PERSON> Bonhoeffer </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonhoeffer </PERSON>, the renowned theologian and Lutheran minister, were led into the rubble outside a prison and executed on <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s personal orders. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, professor of religious studies at <ORGANIZATION> Lynchburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, spent four years seeking and interviewing Germans or their relatives who were involved in the Christian resistance to <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, a generally unknown voice in the wilderness of inaction against or collaboration with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. The collection he has established, 200 hours of videotape available by mail for researchers and historians, was dedicated recently at the college. <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON>, a Jewish survivor of the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp, termed the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> resisters to <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> `` righteous Gentiles.'' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>'s project was financed by <ORGANIZATION> Seventh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The only other videotape archives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the subject of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where interviews of 1,400 Holocaust survivors and witnesses to the atrocities against Jews are maintained, said <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudof </PERSON>, project manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> collection. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, who received his master's degree and doctorate at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, said there were two questions for which he sought explanations: Where were the Christians during <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s rise to power? Why did they not prevent the horror of the Holocaust? `` It's important for people to know there was early resistance to the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> regime and he's documenting this,'' <PERSON> Rudof </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>. On <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>'s efforts to explain why most Christians turned their backs on the Jews while a few helped them, <PERSON> Rudof </PERSON> said: `` It's such an unresolved question. There is still a great bitterness on behalf of many Jews who ask, ` Why did n't they help us more?' And there are some Jews who praise the help given to them by Christians.'' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said that at one crucial point in 1934 when <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> had not yet consolidated his power, 45 percent of the clergy in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were aligned with the Confessing Church, organized specifically to oppose his racist regime replete with anti-Semitic policies. No other group of professionals followed the example of the Confessing Church and publicly opposed <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, be it lawyers who could have decried the arbitrary denial of rights to Jews or scientists who could have spoken out against the dismissal of Jewish colleagues, <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said if there had been more public opposition, <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s policies could have been modified and the Holocaust, the systematic extermination of 6 million Jews that began in 1941, might have been prevented In addition to the Jews, an estimated 5 million other people died or were killed in the camps, including people branded as liberals or opponents to fascism, scholars and homosexuals. But the movement faded and the number of Christians involved in the resistance dwindled. <PERSON> Rudof </PERSON> said some pastors went so far as to join <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s secret police. Why did so many Christians remain silent? `` Different answers were given by almost everyone,'' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said. `` They said some were afraid. Some ignored the realities behind the propaganda. Some people were preoccupied with personal affairs.'' The most eloquent answer, <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said, came from <PERSON> Renate </PERSON> <PERSON> Bethge </PERSON>, the daughter of an executed <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> resister and neice of <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonhoeffer </PERSON>. `` She said, ` When people know enough to know if they learn more it will require some risk ... then it is surprising how little people want to learn.''' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said he does not want to portray the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> members of the resistance as heroes. `` They failed to prevent the Holocaust, World War II and the destruction of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. At the same time it should be remembered that they tried to prevent those kind of things. They should not be forgotten.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Smylie </PERSON>, a professor of church history at Union Theological Seminary in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, said the remaining <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> resisters are rapidly dying. `` <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> gave 36 persons still alive an opportunity to talk, live on camera, about their experiences in those excruciating years,'' <PERSON> Smylie </PERSON> said. `` Their reflections are now part of the record, which will assist us in reassessing this past and understanding our own responsibilities today.''

No city in the world is host to more foreign diplomats than New York City,
a metropolis not noted for its hospitality. Many are immune from laws local
citizens must obey, some don't speak English. Disputes are inevitable,
sometimes settled at gunpoint. Middle of day or middle of night, the adjudicator
of disputes is a woman of infinite patience, Gillian Sorensen.    ___</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, told that <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, were coming for a visit, said: `` Great. Invite them to dinner. I'll take them to my favorite <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant.'' While the reaction says something of the mayor's natural exuberance, it also says a great deal of this polyglot city that is host to the world's largest diplomatic corps, some 40,000 men, women and children from widely divergent cultures. They staff 159 missions to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and 87 consulates. If it's not easy living with 8 million New Yorkers, it's no piece of cake for the New Yorkers either. Many of these guests live within the sometime shelter of diplomatic immunity. Their various embassies are considered foreign territory, immune from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> police force, even city inspectors, as is the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> itself. And their 1,000 cars have special areas to park, one of their privileges, which does n't stop them from parking illegally almost anywhere they choose Last year, 65,000 parking violations were issued to cars with diplomatic plates, down from 154,000 a decade earlier, an indication of better cooperation. The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> conventions do specify that the diplomats should respect the laws of the host country. So diplomatic vehicles can be towed to the city pound if they threaten the health and safety, but unlike everyday New Yorkers, the erring diplomat can retrieve his car without cost in most circumstances. The city concedes there is not enough diplomatic parking space. Fifty-five missions and consulates do n't have any at all. But it is the one battlefield where the host New Yorkers and their guests cross bayonets. Not long ago, the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> ambassador pulled up to his designated diplomatic parking spot in front of his residence just as a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorker </LOCATION> was backing into it. The ambassador asked him to move and he would n't. It heated up from there. Finally the ambassador pulled a gun and won back his parking place. The person who adjudicates, mediates, calms the angry waters, is <PERSON> Gillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>, head of the city's Commission for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. She is the wife of <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney who served in President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s White House. Their home phone rings at all hours of the night. The diplomatic 911 number seems to be `` Call Gillian.'' `` Not that it happens every night, because it does n't,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> says. `` But it still makes me jump because I know if they're calling at that hour, it's important. They know someone will respond.'' It can be anything from a bomb threat to a diplomatic suicide or a runaway child or a heart attack. `` The daughter of the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> ambassador died the other day of an asthma attack in a matter of minutes,'' she says. `` If it's a towed car, we let it wait until morning.'' For her, it is an obvious labor of love. `` I learned how deeply diplomats care about their work,'' she says. `` I learned how the image of diplomats as high-living, socializing, striped-pants types is far from the truth.'' As commissioner, she is a sometimes housemother to people who are far from home, in an alien environment, vulnerable. They have their share of stolen cars, stolen car radios, even stolen license plates. A car belonging to <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> was hijacked at knife point in October. Ms. <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> points out that the red-white-and-blue diplomatic plates make them highly visible. To counteract this, one diplomat put an `` I love <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' sticker on his bumper. So she made them available to any embassy or consulate that wanted them. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, the Holy See and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> were among the first to order. Hundreds went out. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is not an easy environment. During the telephone strike, there were some 80 calls from diplomats who could n't get their phones installed and were out of communication with their home governments. Ms. <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> and her staff of 14 `` were able on a selective and emergency basis to get their phones hooked up.'' Then there was the time a water main burst and flooded the basement of the <ORGANIZATION> Bulgarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> where they keep important files. The water department responded quickly. `` Another time, the Chinese Consulate in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> called in consternation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> remembers. `` They looked out their windows and to their shock there were flaming cars speeding by.'' It turned out to be a movie crew filming a chase scene. The crew had a permit, but nobody had notified the Chinese. `` World War III is not breaking out,'' she reassured them. Part of her staff's job is to cut through municipal red tape, provide advice on everything from leases to insurance to child care to provisions for the handicapped.

 Over time, there have been a sprinkling of minor crimes, an occasional shoplifting, a few assaults, usually involving teen-age sons of diplomats. But Ms. <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> insists that as a group the diplomatic corps is responsible, law-abiding. There is a curious pattern in the parking violations, which are tracked by computer. `` We have a handful who tend to be chronic,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> says. `` And then I discovered from friends in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that the worst chronic offenders here are by nationality the worst chronic offenders there.'' It often reflects the attitude toward the law they have at home. When a new ambassador comes in and cracks down, making them pay for their own parking tickets, even when they are not required to pay under international law, the parking violations clear up quickly. Diplomatic immunity is a sometimes thing. Heads of mission and their immediate family generally are immune from all local laws. But as one's grade in post descends, one's immunity erodes. While all of the diplomatic corps are immune to most parking violations, any violation, including those of parking that involve the health and safety of the populace, and that includes moving violations, are not covered. So parking in front of a hydrant or speeding are not in the immunity field except for top diplomats. Even if they did n't have to confront local or state law, they would have to face various degrees of censure from their home states and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. For a while, debt was a large problem, so bad that some <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> landlords would n't rent to diplomatic missions. Probably the premier case involved <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, which is not a poor country. When Zairian President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on a courtesy visit, Mayor <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> received him. After some polite conversation, the head of state asked Ms. <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> about <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s debt in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> She told him that his nation owed more than $ 150,000 in rent and other bills. `` The president was furious and berated his ambassador and his foreign minister who were there,'' she recalls. `` When he heard the sum involved he said, ` You come with us when we leave here.' So I took a City Hall colleague with me and we went to the president's hotel Then and there, from suitcases, they literally paid us in cash, bundles of cash.'' Then there are the political demonstrations on the streets. `` We've had occasions when we've had two opposing views, the pro on this side of the street and the con on that side of the street,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> says. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> gives wide latitude to demonstrators, but the police firmly enforce the limits, broad as they are. `` Sometimes it bothers the neighbors and sometimes it bothers the people in the mission or consulate being picketed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> says. `` We let it be a lesson in democracy, a lesson in free speech. I think that is not a bad lesson. They know they are in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. They know what the rules and regulations are, that people can carry any flag they like, and they can say anything, even outrageous things. `` They may not like it and it may not be allowed at home, but those are the rules we go by, so they accept it.'' It's not the only lesson <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> teaches the foreign diplomat. `` It's heartwarming to me to see that the foreigner's attitude and understanding toward this city and toward democratic society does change with time,'' she says. `` They arrive in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> somewhat intimidated and afraid of the city. Our reputation is kind of frightening. When they leave I find a lot of them love <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. They love the options. They love the rhythm. They love the diversity and the mix. They love the freedoms that we take for granted. And they leave with regret.'' Ms. <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> experience stays with them. `` We know that service in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is an essential step on the career ladder of diplomats. And the younger the country, the younger the diplomat, the more true it is. And we'll see them again, either as ambassador or minister or, in some cases, head of government.'' In her dozen years tending to diplomats, Ms. <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> has seen everything from a terrorist assassination to a head of government who wanted to hire a chef at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and take him home with him because he liked his pancakes. The <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visit on Dec. 6, 1988, marked the end of frosty and somewhat formal relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` Not only was the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> changing its historic role and becoming active and engaged and constructive in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>, but also the citizens of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, with construction workers hanging out a huge sign that said, ` Hard Hats Welcome <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>.' It was proof that you should never give up, that things can change, and that diplomacy is not just a high-fallutin term but a vehicle for that change.'' A footnote to the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s quick trip: It took 5,000 extra police to provide security and traffic control, for which the city was reimbursed $ 2.5 million. When the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> had to cut short the visit on Dec. 8 because of the Armenian earthquake, it was a great disappointment to a fourth-grade class where <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was to visit. The 8-year-olds were all dressed up, their welcome sign was up and the refreshments were ready. `` This is where it goes beyond diplomacy to touch real people and change a view of another power, no longer an evil empire, but somebody's country, a people to know and understand and to learn about,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> says. To her, the whole experience has been extraordinary. And sometimes touching. When the Sultan of <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> arrived to celebrate his country's joining the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, he asked what the city needed. He wanted to present a little gift. Of the hundreds of needs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> named a few. When the Sultan called on the mayor, `` he was about as shy as anyone I've ever seen. You could hardly hear him. He almost spoke in a whisper, so there was a slightly awkward exchange with the mayor. Then he reached into his pocket and took out his little gift. It was a check for $ 500,000 made out to ` Meals On Wheels.'''

It's one of the few areas of Jerusalem where Arabs and Jews live next to
each other. For years they worked and played together in peace in the village
of Abu Tor. But the Palestinian uprising, the intefadeh that has taken
the lives of more than 590 Arabs and 40 Israelis, has raised social barriers
that seem insurmountable.    ___</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The village of <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tor </LOCATION>, its stone houses spilling down a ravine across from the old walled city of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, was once a symbol of Arab-Jewish coexistence. Today, after almost two years of the Palestinian uprising, the Arab and Jewish communities are divided by `` borders of the heart'' that are difficult to cross, even for the sake of simple dialogue. On many recent nights, residents on both sides have been kept awake by the sounds of gunfire, banging on doors and loudspeaker announcements as police hunt for Palestinian youths who set fire to Israeli cars or hurled firebombs at patrols. <PERSON> Abd </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Diab </PERSON>, a leading figure in the Arab sector of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tor </PERSON>, one of the few areas of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> where Jews and <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> live next to each other, says one of the successes of the intefadeh, or uprising, has been defining the borders for a proposed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, showing Israelis where they are welcome and where they are not. `` I have Jewish friends at work, but I do n't remember anyone coming here or me going to their homes,'' says <PERSON> Diab </PERSON>, an official of the Arab-run electric company in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` I ask myself why? The answer is that there is a border in the heart. The Jews feel like outsiders here.'' But the violence that has frightened Jews from visiting Arab areas has made dialogue that much more difficult, not only for the 9,000 Arabs and 2,000 Jews in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tor </LOCATION>, but for Palestinians and Israelis as a whole. One of those scared away is <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavori </PERSON>, a gray-haired <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> lawyer who lives with her husband, <PERSON> Oded </PERSON>, an engineer, in a spacious second-floor apartment on the dividing line between the two sectors. `` I used to go down to the village and drink coffee and shop. Now, I do n't do it any more because it's dangerous. The police told me not to,'' she says. A supporter of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION>, she says tough measures used against her Arab neighbors were upsetting but necessary. These included a four-day curfew during which televisions, radios, videocassette recorders and other items were seized by revenue agents in lieu of unpaid taxes. `` It's nice to talk beautifully, but we have to take a stand and take care of our people,'' she says. `` The Arabs are trying to show us they will not let us live in peace.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tavori </PERSON>, who heads a nearby community center, says that after several incidents of stone - and bottle-throwing the center's basketball court and playground were put off limits to The Jewish sector, located at the top of a hill, is modern and prosperous with parks, gardens and playgrounds. The only visible sign of insecurity is the unusual number of German shepherds, <ORGANIZATION> Salukis </ORGANIZATION> and other guard dogs. The Arab area is noticeably less well-off. It lacks street lighting, some roads are unpaved, garbage goes uncollected, and there are no playgrounds or parks. There are also frequent patrols of paramilitary police carrying assault rifles. Walls are covered with anti-Israeli slogans. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Saloum </PERSON>, the father of seven children ranging in age from 6 months to 13 years, showed a reporter eight holes in his front windows that he said were made by rubber bullets.

 `` Where can we hide?'' he asks, noting that the windows do not have shutters to protect his family from stray bullets. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Saloum </PERSON>, a lean, intense man in his 30s, lost his radio, color TV, videocassette player, electric fan and typewriter during the recent curfew. The items were seized in lieu of taxes he had refused to pay as part of a civil disobedience campaign. Soon after he spoke, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> police van with windows screened to protect against stone-throwing arrived on <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON> outside with heavily armed police walking on either side. They rousted a group of teen-agers and ordered them to clear the street of large stones apparently put up as a barricade. A reporter saw one policeman slap an Arab teen-ager in the back of the head, while another officer kicked a second youth. `` I think it is difficult to make the children understand that we can make peace,'' says <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Saloum </PERSON>, a grocer with a passion for amateur theater. `` They see violence and get radical ideas.'' <PERSON> Nisrin </PERSON>, his green-eyed 13-year-old daughter, says Israeli youths in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tor </LOCATION> have become openly contemptuous. She does not go into the Jewish area alone. `` They think they're superior,'' she says, adding: `` We do n't want to improve relations We want a state.'' <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a curly haired 17-year-old, attended three <LOCATION> Palestinian-Israeli </LOCATION> encounter groups arranged by her mother, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON>. She says Palestinian demands seem unrealistic and extreme, particularly those espoused by Moslem fundamentalists who argue that Jews should live as a protected minority in an Islamic state. `` But I think it's important to get to know these people. If everyone got to know the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> as people, it would be harder to use violence against them,'' she says. Mrs. <PERSON> Tavori </PERSON> said firebombs and other violence have destroyed the feelings of tolerance and coexistence that used to prevail in Abu Tor. `` Look and see how beautiful it is. It's been spoiled,'' she says, gesturing from her balcony at the panoramic view that stretches from the landmark golden cap of the Dome of the Rock mosque in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Judean </LOCATION> hills and the Dead Sea beyond. Mrs. <PERSON> Tavori </PERSON> says she has started a diary to sort out her confused and often conflicting reactions to her Arab neighbors during the uprising that began in December 1987 and has taken the lives of more than 590 Arabs and 40 Israelis. She recalls, for example, walking to an Arab bakery recently for sweet knafy cake, a favorite treat before the uprising. Both she and the owner felt uneasy. `` We were such good friends. But we did n't even smile at each other,'' she says, reading from the diary. When she got home, she heard on the radio that an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> woman and her two children burned to death on a bus in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` The cake stuck in my throat, and I was sorry I went.'' But then, walking alone one day she noticed she was being followed by an Arab man. `` He walked more quickly and I thought, ` Am I supposed to be afraid?' Then he came up and gave a flower and said, ` to a beautiful woman, a beautiful flower.' `` When I tell people the story, they do n't believe it. Everyone thinks I dreamed it.''

 What do the world's rapidly receding rain forests and other endangered ecological climes have to do with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>? Or <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, for that matter? Or <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>? Or <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>? All of those cities and many others either have or are planning a plant conservatory, a kind of sophisticated greenhouse where they can nurture specimens of the world's endangered plant life, much as zoos protect some endangered animal species. <PERSON> Evie </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> came all the way to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where by luck she got a lead on 18 acres of land back home in <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on which to build the plant conservatory she has been dreaming of for years. Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON>, and her husband, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, a retired schoolteacher, recently attended a two-day workshop, `` Conservatories of the 21st Century,'' at the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> Botanical Garden. Experts attended from all over the country. For the Whites it was a wellspring of knowledge. Most conservatories are the crown jewel of a botanical garden. Sometimes they are called `` the Rembrandt in the museum.'' In the garden, landscape architects and horticulturists do the best they can with the existing climate. In the conservatory, where heating and cooling systems may be computer controlled, horticulturists can preserve rare plants, plants that grow tens of thousands of miles away, plants from the other side of the equator, plants that people in a town would never see if it were n't for the controlled climates the conservatories provide. The concept dates back at least to Roman times. But in 1989, <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a town of 40,000, yet part of the <LOCATION> Quad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> with a populace of 250,000, has decided it wants a conservatory. So, it seems, have a lot of others. It may be the growth industry of culture as conservatories, and dreams of glass houses for plants, sprout across the country. More than $ 150 million is being spent already. Experts, such as <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerwin </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Botanical </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, a 240-acre complex with a beautiful turn-of-the-century Victorian conservatory, say the boom partially reflects an ecology-conscious nation. `` You turn on any news show and you will see a segment on how the rain forests are disappearing,'' <PERSON> Kerwin </PERSON> says. `` Everyone is now aware of a problem that few knew little about just a few years ago.'' Experts tell us that rain forests are disappearing at the rate of an acre a second and that the earth is losing three plant species an hour, perhaps taking with them great medicinal or economic secrets. But <PERSON> Kerwin </PERSON> does n't think concern for the ecology is the sole reason for the interest in conservatories. `` If that were the case, you could buy up quite a bit of <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> real estate with $ 100 million and preserve the original,'' he says. There seems to be an attendant sense of civic pride about having a conservatory. You've got the art museum, the symphony, a zoo, and now, by gosh, it's about time for that conservatory. Most of the new construction has been in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> and </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, where culture is moving in along with the satellite dish. The <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> Botanical Garden played host to the first-ever conference to study everything from fund-raising to new methods of pest control, as well as to show off its own $ 25 million restoration and new construction, the <PERSON> Steinhardt </PERSON> <PERSON> Conservatory </PERSON>. Representatives of the four newest conservatories _ the ones in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ dominated the sessions dealing with architecture, ventilation, shading, cooling and heating, publicity, the pros and cons of receiving municipal, county or state support, how to present a good educational program, how to introduce predator insects. It revealed a basic conflict between architects and horticulturists. Architects want to make a statement with the structure. Horticulturists want to obscure the structure as much as possible so that visitors feel they are lost in time as they meander through the misty fronds. The Whites of <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> are thinking more modestly than their <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> host, perhaps $ 3 million to $ 4 million. They personally have a bonsai collection of more than 100 trees, someone else has a rose collection, a third has a cactus collection and they all want to will them to a conservatory. `` We've been talking about it for three years, but I've met people here who have been trying to raise money for 18 years,'' Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON> says.

 They do n't have the potential resources <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> has. When costs ran high, <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> found a last-minute benefactor, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> <PERSON> Streeter </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinhardt </PERSON>, who donated $ 3 million. Since his was the largest single donation, the lovely glass houses, connected underground, are called the Steinhardt Conservatory. `` You could say that you do get a lot of bang for your buck when you contribute to a conservatory,'' observed <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the director of one of the new conservatories, the Myriad Gardens' Crystal Bridge in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> The Crystal Bridge is a $ 6.3 million modernistic structure that evokes the sense of being in a space capsule at the same time as being in a primeval world of nature. Some have described the 14,000-square-foot cylindrical bridge as a `` trash can littering the landscape.'' It is, however, an example of the creative architecture evolving in the greenhouse world. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, industrialist <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON> picked up the entire tab, $ 5.5 million, for the <ORGANIZATION> Dorothy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chapman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fuqua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservatory </ORGANIZATION>, a conservatory with rare plants, man-made mist, free-flying birds, a collection of more than 300 carnivorous plants. It promises to be a major conservatory of the future, with a commitment to preserving rare plants. The new <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> showpiece has 16,000 square feet of display space and is named in honor of <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON>'s wife of 43 years. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, there is the new <PERSON> Lucile </PERSON> <PERSON> Halsell </PERSON> <PERSON> Conservatory </PERSON>, carved into the ground with a series of soaring glass roofs and containing an innovative Alpine environment, as well as the traditional palm trees, showy orchids and cacti. This 90,000-square-foot complex, opened in 1988, carried a $ 7 million price tag, $ 5 million of which came from the <ORGANIZATION> Halsell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, endowed by the late <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Halsell </PERSON>. It was then turned over to the city to maintain with the hopes that it would be a major tourist attraction, ranking just below the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walk </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Tschanz </PERSON>, now at <ORGANIZATION> Powell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gardens </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which has a conservatory in its future, was the director at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> when it was built. He says one study showed it ranked among the top five <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> tourist attractions when it first opened. `` Part of that was because it was new,'' he says. `` A lot of conservatories have tremendous tourist appeal when they first open.'' <PERSON> Tschanz </PERSON> says that when <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>' <PERSON> Climatron </PERSON> opened in 1960, it was packed with tourists, but it did not maintain that appeal. The Climatron was perhaps the most spectacular conservatory use of <PERSON> Buckminster </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>'s geodesic dome, a popular design in the mini-boom of the'60s. It now is undergoing a $ 12.8 million renovation, mostly replacing the acrylic glass that had yellowed with age. The <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horticultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, is one, like <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, that is starting from scratch and eventually hopes to put together an $ 8 million botanical gardens and conservatory. The county has donated 50 acres and they are about to launch the first fund drive. `` It looks doable and we're constantly on the march,'' says the president, <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Borre </PERSON>. `` My family teases me about being president because my house plants are dying.'' In <LOCATION> Murrells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, a $ 5 million phase one is planned for <LOCATION> Brookgreen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION>, but Hurricane Hugo has taken the committee right back to the drawing boards. The director, <PERSON> Gurdon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarbox </PERSON>, thinks a traditional greenhouse would have gone with the winds. <PERSON> Brookgreen </PERSON> is unique for combining sculpture with plants. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Botanical Garden in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, lists $ 15.2 million for what may be a renovation of the existing conservatory, but may end up being a complete reconstruction. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpern </PERSON>, horticulturist for the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> Zoo and Botanical Gardens, proposed putting birds into the conservatories. Some, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Fuqua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservatory </ORGANIZATION>, already have them, but it generally is not an idea whose time has come. `` We have to get the public in and the sounds of birds, the whirring of birds in flight, a sighting of a bird, is a great draw,'' <PERSON> Halpern </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Halpern </PERSON> tells of one Canadian conservatory with free-flying birds that had to start screening the visitors. One woman released her pet parakeet so it could live in splendor. Another was stopped before she could release a box of finches. <PERSON> Alden </PERSON> <PERSON> Aust </PERSON> is a retired city planner and chairman of the committee to get a botanical gardens and conservatory in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. He and his wife attended the conference to pick up pointers. Aust lists the usual reasons why he feels <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> should have a conservatory. He holds what may be the strongest explanation until last. `` Well, <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> has one and it's half our size.''

 During the last ice age about 16,000 years ago, when mammoths and mastodons roamed <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the boulders and gravel from retreating glaciers filled an ancient stream channel and created a 13-mile-long expanse of water, waterlilies and waterfowl. From all appearances, little has changed. <PERSON> Conneaut </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> is inaccessible xcept by canoe, and even then channels must be cut periodically through the mucky sediments and viney undergrowth to allow even limited passage. It is in this isolated setting, flanked on all sides by sparsely populated farms and tall stands of trees, that a pair of bald eagles have built a home. They represent two of 10 bald eagles nesting in water-rich <LOCATION> Crawford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Another 10 are believed to have taken up permanent residence along rivers in the central pat of the state, thanks to programs devoted to relocating chicks taken from Canadian nests and reintroducing them to the state. `` This is an effort to return the national emblem to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and make it available for citizens to observe without having to go to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Byerly </PERSON> of the state Game Commission. `` When I see an eagle flying along the river I want to say to my kid, ` There goes our national emblem.' I do n't want to say, ` There goes one released from the Hershey Zoo.' I want to see it wild and flying free.'' Throughout the country, from the deserts of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> to the swamps of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to the deep waters of the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, eagles have made a dramatic comeback from the days of the now-banned pesticide DDT, which decimated the species three decades ago. The population has climbed from an all-time low of about 350 nesting pairs in the mid-1960s to about 2,400 nesting pairs today, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. An additional 3,000 to 7,000 younger birds _ under the breeding age of 5 years _ are believed to roam the skies, including roughly 800 that have been released through relocation programs over the past decade. Although 20 eagles seems a small number in a state as large as <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, there are countless more eagles spotted throughout the state at various times of year, <PERSON> Byerly </PERSON> says. Many are simply passing through on their migratory routes, while others are part of a group of 88 young eagles that have been released over the past seven years but are not old enough to mate and build nests. Able to adapt to subarctic temperatures and hot, arid climates, the bald eagle is most often found where there are water and lots of fish. `` This bird can literally be found in all the lower 48 states at all times of the year, either as a nesting bird, a migrating bird or a wintering bird,'' says <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, an endangered species biologist with the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` It nests in all but perhaps three or four states and it winters in or migrates through the rest.'' So successful has been their recovery that the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is considering taking eagles off the list of endangered species and changing their classification to threatened, <PERSON> James </PERSON> says. `` Legally, a threatened species is one that may become endangered if trends in the population continue,'' he says. `` What we're seeing, though, is just the opposite. Clearly, the eagle is on the increase.'' But conservation groups say the tough, majestic bird is still too fragile, too easily harmed by man's destructive ways, to take any chances. The Exxon Valdez oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, for example, inflicted severe casualties in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s eagle nesting grounds.

 They say we are still a long way off from the estimated 50,000 eagles that once soared above the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> when this country was young and the eagle was named the national symbol. `` There's not a lot of room for error on this. A bird as big and vulnerable to habitat loss and poaching as the bald eagle deserves constant attention, and we would rather err on the side of caution,'' says <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, president of Defenders of Wildlife. `` Although DDT is behind us, there are new chemicals being invented every day,'' he says. `` In addition, we see rapid population growth, urbanization, the loss of wetlands and the loss of old growth forest trees in which the eagles nest, and there's no reason for optimism as far as eagle habitat protection is concerned.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pissot </PERSON>, who specializes in endangered species for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, says he is excited by the idea that eagles may have recovered sufficiently to warrant changing their status. But, like <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, he worries their habitat will be whittled away little by little by a country eager to clear forests, drain wetlands and build roads. `` Without strong federal oversight, we could be picking away at their habitats _ a nest tree there, some roosting areas someplace else _ and we could be in the position we were in 40 years ago,'' he says. `` Even with the bird listed as endangered, there still is the possibility that habitat will be lost. But as the bird is down-listed to ` threatened,' that door opens wider, and if it's taken off the list entirely, that door opens very wide. Regardless of the federal government's decision, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> wildlife officials plan to maintain strict vigils over the state's brood In <LOCATION> Conneaut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marsh </LOCATION>, for instance, birdwatchers are allowed no closer than a half-mile from the eagles' nest, or aerie, while motorists driving through nearby <ORGANIZATION> Erie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> are not permitted to stop or park on a section of roadway near another nest. `` They are so fragile,'' says <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Peebles </PERSON>, who monitors the 10 <LOCATION> Crawford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> eagles for the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Game Commission. `` They do n't like people. They do n't like to be disturbed. If they have eggs and you come near them, they're likely to abandon their eggs.'' A powerful predator, the bald eagle is happiest, ironically, when it does n't have to kill what it eats and can pick at the remains of dead fish and wounded ducks left behind by other predators. `` Eagles are thieves and robbers,'' says <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, an ornithologist with the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` The osprey will catch the fish and the eagles will steal it from them.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Faber </PERSON>, a free-lance naturalist from <LOCATION> Hiram </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, who conducts tours of <LOCATION> Conneaut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marsh </LOCATION>, chuckles, `` It does n't make for a good image of the country.'' Nevertheless, Americans are fascinated with the elusive, solitary bird. A group of 40 Pittsburgh-area residents recently drove two hours and paddled canoes for several miles just to catch a glimpse _ through binoculars _ of the snowy white head of an eagle perched in a 7-foot-deep nest high atop a dead tree in <LOCATION> Conneaut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marsh </LOCATION>. The marsh was alive with snipe, warblers, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> geese, carp doing belly-flops. But it was the pair of eagles, either surveying their watery world from the nest or soaring silently over treetops, that captured everyone's attention. `` I would n't have missed this for the world,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>, 78, of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, who has traveled several continents to watch birds. <PERSON> Gay </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalisz </PERSON>, 43, of <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, added: `` It's not like a walk in the woods. It was wonderful to see this after knowing of the slaughter they've gone through.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> advertised in it, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> sued it and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> tried to buy a piece of it. The Hartford Courant, born in 1764 above a barbershop in what was then a bustling river town, just celebrated its 225th birthday, another milestone for the nation's oldest continuously published newspaper. The Courant celebrated in October by opening a $ 15 million addition to its main office and by cranking up the hand-operated press that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> used to print the Courant in the late 1700s. The Courant was a weekly until 1837, and so can not lay claim to being the nation's oldest daily. That distinction belongs to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, printed daily since 1801. The Courant has never won a Pulitzer Prize and has always lived in the shadows of bigger, more acclaimed newspapers in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But it has endured, outlasting 40 now-defunct <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> papers, and today remains a robust newspaper in a troubled industry. `` The fact that it has held up all these years and is still regarded as a paper of quality is impressive,'' said <PERSON> Everette </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's not The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, but it serves its purpose. It's a major regional newspaper.'' With daily circulation at 225,000 and slowly climbing, the Courant is by far the largest paper in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. It prints seven regional editions with news from more than 70 <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> cities and towns from the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> border to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>. During the Revolutionary War, the <ORGANIZATION> Courant </ORGANIZATION> had _ by its own account _ the largest circulation of any newspaper in the Colonies, and was an influential supporter of the revolution. `` AMERICANS!'' the Courant blared to its readers in May 1775. `` Forever bear in mind the BATTLE of <LOCATION> LEXINGTON </LOCATION>! Where British troops, unmolested and unprovoked, wantonly, and in a most inhuman manner, fired upon and killed a number of our countrymen.'' When the Constitution was proposed in 1787, the Courant printed it in full as a news item. The Courant made clear its support for the Constitution by running articles on the need for a stronger union of the states and printing unanswered letters from the Constitution's advocates. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> was president when he ran two ads in the Courant in 1796. The first offered four farms for rent near his <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION> estate. The president warned he would rent only `` to real farmers of good reputation and none others need apply.'' During the early 1800s, the Courant, like most newspapers of the time, adopted a bitterly partisan tone. The paper's chief target was <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, whom it saw as a godless slave owner, a tool of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and an enemy of the Constitution. The <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> administration took notice, and indicted the Courant for criminal libel in 1806 after the paper ran a story strongly implying that the administration had sent 60 tons of silver to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> as a bribe. The Courant was vindicated six years later when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> dismissed the suit, ruling that English criminal common law _ the basis for the indictment _ did not apply in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Courant enthusiastically backed <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> for president in 1860, and declared `` Victory! Victory! We've Got'Em!'' when <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> won. But the Courant of the mid-19th century was anything but progressive. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, the publisher, railed against immigrants and treated readers to large doses of his own racial and religious bigotry. `` The Caucasian variety is intrinsically a better breed, of better brain, better moral traits, better capacity every way, than the Negro, or the Mongolian, or the Malay, or the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION>,'' he wrote. After the Civil War, the Courant resisted the `` new journalism'' of the day, a rambunctious style that gave readers a heavy dose of stories on crime and personalities and relied on a relatively new reporting technique _ the interview. This, the <ORGANIZATION> Courant </ORGANIZATION> wrote, was `` Ungentlemanly Journalism,'' marked by `` the vile invention of ` interviewing.''' It was during this period of polite and principled journalism that <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>'s most celebrated writer, tried to buy into the Courant. The offer was carefully considered and then turned down. By the 1920s, the Courant's prim approach to the news had earned it the nickname `` The Old Lady of State Street.'' A young managing editor named <PERSON> Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauvreau </PERSON> tried to change that, and for a brief period of four years, the old lady became a flapper, heavy on crime, sex and photographs. But <PERSON> Gauvreau </PERSON>'s taste for the bizarre proved too much for the staid Courant, and he was soon asked to leave. He took his talents to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Evening Graphic, where he boosted circulation to 500,000 with a sensational style that earned the paper the nickname `` Porno-Graphic.'' The Courant, meanwhile, regained its more measured voice, although the Great Depression brought an air of quiet desperation the paper could not ignore. The Courant published stories on `` How to Feed Four on $ 9 a Week.'' The Courant discovered its suburban readers in the postwar years, and circulation more than doubled, from 52,000 in 1946 to 130,000 in 1964. When the paper turned 200 in 1964, it already had 13 news bureaus crowded into the small state and more than 100 correspondents phoning in local news. In 1965, the Courant overtook The <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in daily circulation, and within 11 years the Times, once the city's dominant paper, was dead The Courant's ascendancy made the paper an attractive property, and in 1979 the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-based </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 105 million for the Courant, ending 215 years of local ownership. The first years of <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> management were somewhat rocky. The paper's new emphasis on regional stories, feature writing and investigative projects clashed with a long tradition of exhaustive local coverage. In <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, community activists demonstrated outside the newspaper, charging that the Courant had abandoned the city. Editor <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was hanged in effigy. Reporter <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreig </PERSON> left the paper and wrote `` Spiked,'' a book accusing the Courant's new management of deceiving the papers' readers in pursuit of a Pulitzer Prize. Under current editor and publisher <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, the Courant has returned to an emphasis on local news and has opened a turf war against five suburban dailies by aggressively courting local advertisers in the cities and towns surrounding <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A new television series, ``Life Goes On,'' deals with
the problems facing a youth with Down's syndrome attempting to attend a
high school with normal kids. It's a subject close to the heart of a Miami
couple who two years ago established a foundation to help children with
the disorder. Putting the children into the mainstream, they have learned,
is fraught with difficulty.    ___</HEAD>

 Like millions of other children, 3-year-old <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> <PERSON> Geraldi </PERSON> went off to begin preschool this fall. But she was soon sent home and told not to return. <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> was excluded because she has Down's syndrome. The first attempt at `` mainstreaming'' her with a typical preschool class had proved unsuccessful. <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s adoptive parents, Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Geraldi </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Camille </PERSON>, were upset, but not defeated. They have adopted seven children with Down's, have pending adoptions for six others and have legal guardianship of another, a grand total of 14. They also have two children of their own. The Geraldis began the `` Up With Down Syndrome'' foundation in 1987 and devoted it to training, loving and caring for children with Down's syndrome. They also counsel the natural parents of the children. In addition, they provide day care for parents of other children with the problem and teach adults with Down's how to develop better job skills and become more independent. All of these services are free. Most of the children the <PERSON> Geraldis </PERSON> have adopted, who range in age from 2 months to 3 years, have serious medical problems. `` When you nourish and love them, something happens. Their health improves dramatically,'' Ms. <PERSON> Geraldi </PERSON> says. The problems can range from digestive disorders to serious heart defects. One of their children, 1-year-old Jo-layne, already has undergone two open heart surgeries and seven other major operations. Down's syndrome is a genetic defect resulting from a child having one extra chromosome. This extra chromosome can cause the child to be born with a host of physical and mental problems. Symptoms can include a depressed nose, clubfeet, a raised upper lip, wide spacing between fingers and toes and decreased mental capacity. Parents have been counseled in the past to put their child in an institution because of mental retardation, but Ms. <PERSON> Geraldi </PERSON> says current research shows that a loving home environment allows them to function at a higher level. The foundation's two group homes in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> are designed to provide that support, she says. Ms. <PERSON> Geraldi </PERSON>, a nurse with a special education degree, says she developed a special sympathy for children with Down's syndrome at a very young age. When she was 5 years old, she helped her father, who volunteered at a nursing home for the retarded. While she was working as a nurse at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, she met her husband and found they shared `` a love for children that were not perfect and normal.'' `` He was as sensitive as I was to the children,'' she says. <PERSON> Geraldi </PERSON>, a pediatrician, and his wife attempted to adopt a Down's baby from various agencies, including the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, but never heard from any of them. In the meantime, they had their own two children, <PERSON> Renae </PERSON>, 12, and <PERSON> Jaclyn </PERSON>, 11. But in 1986 they received a call about a very sick baby with Down's in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> who was 5 weeks old and weighed only four pounds. They picked her up in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and, after some legal red tape, they adopted the child, <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON>, now a healthy 3-year-old. The foundation is supported solely by donations and her husband's salary, she says. Because of his salary, they do n't qualify for any kind of state aid, she says. They have spent more than $ 500,000 so far in medical bills and hope to become eligible for Medicaid. Ms. <PERSON> Geraldi </PERSON> says that fears of Down's children that persisted until recent years were unfounded, but many people are still uneasy around children with the disorder. `` I was in the grocery store with some of the kids and when people saw us in an aisle, they would turn and walk away,'' she says. A new television series is helping change that. `` Life Goes On,'' a critically acclaimed weekly series, is the story of an 18-year-old boy attempting to go to a regular high school with normal kids. This experiment is known as mainstreaming and tries to integrate Down's sufferers into normal environments. But Ms. <PERSON> Geraldi </PERSON> says, `` I do n't think the program is very realistic.'' She says the boy on the TV program is exceptionally functional for someone with Down's syndrome and has less of the physical characteristics. However, she says, the show does portray the difficulties of mainstreaming. The children encounter ridicule from classmates and lessons from teachers untrained in special education. <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s teacher did not know how to discipline her when she refused to listen. Also, other parents objected to her presence in the class. `` After all I've seen, I still cried when <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> was sent home,'' Ms. <PERSON> Geraldi </PERSON> says.

 On the matter of awards for actors, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON> admits he likes to watch them, `` but only as a fly on the wall.'' That may change next March when the Academy Awards are handed out at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Music Center. <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON> seems dead certain to be nominated for his absolutely stunning performance in the Dublin-made `` My Left Foot.'' He was acclaimed best actor in September at the <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> and received raves from critics at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Film Festival. Strange title, right? Of course you ca n't learn from the ads -LRB- `` a story about life, laughter, and the occasional miracle'' -RRB- what the film is about. What it's about is <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the Irish cerebral palsy victim who managed to become an acclaimed writer and artist although he was virtually mute and could express himself only with his left foot. <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON>' performance is no more downbeat than <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON>'s in `` Children of a Lesser God,'' which also dealt with a handicap The actor captures all the rage, frustration, yearning and devilish humor of <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> despite the physical limitations. But then, filmgoers have learned to expect the unexpected from <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON> in his brief film career. Consider these roles: the blond gay punk of `` My Beautiful Laundrette,'' the priggish slick-haired suitor in `` Room With a View,'' the lascivious Czech surgeon in `` The Unbearable Lightness of Being.'' He manages to submerge his own persona in each role, and it was a surprise to find him at the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> festival a darkly handsome, soft-spoken Englishman with a headband holding back his long hair. His outfit was highlighted by a pair of pajama-like pants of navy blue with large white polka dots. Interviewing <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON> is a challenge. His replies are punctuated with thoughtful pauses, as he struggles to say exactly what he means. He admitted his early ambivalence about undertaking the portrayal of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` I did n't think that I could do it, but I had a strong impulse to take it on. Beyond that, I did n't really mind if I did n't do it. I was very happy that it had given me the desire to work again, which I had lost some time before. So it seemed like a gift that had come from nowhere,'' he said. After finishing `` The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' he had been afflicted not by actor's block but with `` an unshakable fatigue, which left me without any desire to perform whatsoever.'' It lasted a year, but he had expected it to last longer. Writer-director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>'s script for `` My Left Foot'' intrigued <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON>, and the pair spent three months researching in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. The actor devoted much of the time at the <ORGANIZATION> Sandymount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> observing how children learn to deal with the physical limitations of cerebral palsy. He also was accepted into the <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> family. <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> died in 1981. Meanwhile, producer <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> sought backing for the $ 1.5 million project. Not an easy task, the actor admitted. `` You have to deal with a really immense reluctance and, at worst, a kind of cynical attitude that ` well, this is a kind of cripple picture,' which makes me furious,'' he said. `` But, of course, that's what you come up against: Films tend to be financed by people who do n't understand the process of filmmaking and have no passion for it. It's very difficult to offer your passion as a justification for making a film. It does n't work. <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON>' immersion in the <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> role has astounded reviewers, and the actor explained: `` This may be presumptuous of me, but I felt that I had an understanding of to some extent his anger, his frustrations, his desire to create, his sense of impotence. Many different aspects of his life I felt I had an understanding of, and they did n't relate specifically in my mind to his disability at all. `` It became very important to me that it did n't become a film about a supposedly able-bodied actor taking on the physical manifestations of this supposedly disabled man. That seemed to me a secondary importance.'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON>, 32, had a far different background from the working-class <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. His father was <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s poet laureate <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON>; his mother was actress <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Balcon </PERSON>, daughter of filmmaker Sir <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Balcon </PERSON>. The boy made a brief acting debut at 12 in `` Sunday, Bloody Sunday,'' but in school contemplated becoming a cabinetmaker. Acting prevailed, and he trained at the <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vic </LOCATION>. His adult debut in films came as a seaman in the <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson-Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> `` The Bounty'' remake. He toured with the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, playing leads in `` Romeo and <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON>'' and `` A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' then began his string of remarkable film portrayals. <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON> was asked if he considered <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> a genius. After an extended silence, he replied: `` <PERSON> Christy </PERSON>? Yeah. I'd say that he was a genius in the way that he lived his life. Not necessarily in his work, though I think that some of his writing is quite superb. `` My admiration for him has more to do with the manner in which he lived his life, and his, uh, relentless confrontation with things that people around him found difficult to accept.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Yields on 10-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> notes fell in Monday's auction to the lowest level in 33 months while yields on short-term securities rose. The average yield for the 10-year notes was 7.94 percent, down from 8.03 percent at the last auction on Aug. 9. The auction was part of the government's quarterly refunding postponed last week by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' delay in raising the debt limit. It was the lowest rate since 10-year notes averaged 7.25 percent on Feb. 4, 1987. The notes will carry a coupon interest rate of 7 ~ percent with each $ 10,000 in face value selling for $ 9,955.70 A total of $ 10 billion in notes was sold out of bids totaling $ 22.8 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> will complete its refunding with the auction on Tuesday of $ 10 billion in 30-year bonds. It sold $ 10 billion in three-year notes last Thursday and $ 10 billion in 36-day cash management bills last Friday. In the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s regular weekly auction, interest rates on short-term securities rose to their highest level in two weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 8 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.68 percent, up from 7.67 percent last week. Another $ 8 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.51 percent, up from 7.49 percent last week. The rates were the highest since Oct. 30 when three-month bills sold for 7.78 percent and six-month bills averaged 7.62 percent. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors _ 7.94 percent for three-month bills with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $ 9,805.90 and 7.92 percent for a six-month bill selling for $ 9,620.30.

 The audience was the <ORGANIZATION> Wings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, but those looking for news on <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s recent forays in the airline business got a dose of Japan-bashing instead when the developer spoke to an astonished crowd of industry executives. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is truly taking advantage of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ...

The remarks by <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, best known for his New York-based real estate empire, come in the wake of a Japanese firm's purchase of a controlling interest in the company that controls <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> landmark. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> also owns the former <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> shuttle and made a brief run at the parent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> last month, but he surprised the industry crowd by saying almost nothing about the airline business. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>, a well known <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> imagemaker whose clients include <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, said the real estate tycoon has spoken publicly before about <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> but that some of the themes sounded in Monday's speech appeared to be new. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who did n't consult <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON> about the speech, spoke without a prepared text or notes. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> bought the Northeast shuttle service from Eastern for $ 365 million last June and made a $ 7.5 billion buyout proposal in October for <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of industry leader American. He later dropped the <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> offer, after it had been rebuffed by management and the company's shares retreated sharply from an earlier runup. In one of his few serious comments about the airline industry, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> asserted after his speech that the <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> shareholders have been `` absolutely crucified over the years.'' `` It's a well run airline but from the stockholders' standpoint, they have been treated horribly,'' he said. He declined comment, however, on whether he planned a new move regarding AMR.

 Labor, education and business leaders have joined to launch a foundation linking the classroom with the workplace to stimulate high school students' interest in business. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> offers a two-year program for high school juniors and seniors with a special curriculum designed by educators in consultation with industry experts. Each student is offered a paid, on-the-job summer internship with a business. The foundation is headed by former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>. It is modeled after the successful <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>, pioneered in 1982 by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> brokerage division in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Warning of an employment crisis within two to three years, <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said Monday that `` the only possible way we can avoid that is by having a recession so deep that we would be desperately worried about this country. `` We are going to run short of people. We're going to run short of people with skills and there is no immediate response that could be made that will stop us from running into that problem,'' he said, pointing to the end of the `` baby boom era'' in five years, when there will be an estimated 7 million fewer people in their twenties than there are now. Along with the manpower shortage, <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said `` our children are being less well educated than we were. That's insane. It's the first time in 200 years that's been true and it's true today.'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said the academy `` begins to address that problem.'' He said there are 35 Academy of Finance programs in 17 cities and four Academies of Travel and Tourism in two cities. More than 170 businesses have provided internships for academy students. More than 2,200 students are enrolled in academy programs, including 60 percent minorities. Most of the students are juniors and seniors, but high school freshmen and sophomores are offered preparatory courses to qualify them for the academy by the junior year. Academy courses are in addition to the regular high school curriculum. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> students take such courses as international finance, security operations and financial planning. Travel and tourism classes include destination geography and tourism computer applications. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said school districts and school boards must invite the academy to their area and guarantee that financing for the program will continue once business start-up money of about $ 50,000 ends.

 The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> is staging a rowdy show of labor solidarity and serving notice that its unions plan to adopt a more aggressive stance in the coming years. The 14.1 million-member federation opened its 18th biennial constitutional convention Monday, beginning with a sing-along to promote labor unity and ending by passing a resolution pledging support for union workers involved in several major strikes. The most celebrated event of the week-long convention comes today when Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> appears to thank the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> for its support of the Polish trade union and accept the federation's highest honor, the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Meany </PERSON> Human Rights Award. On Monday, the 800 delegates warmly welcomed the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> back under labor's umbrella and enjoyed a procession by hundreds of workers involved in the strikes, one of which may soon be over. <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> told the gathering that his union and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> have reached a tentative company-wide settlement with <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and hope to resolve local issues within a week. The two unions represent 60,000 workers who have been on strike for 15 weeks against <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, which provides phone service in most of the Northeast. <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> strikers joined their counterparts at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in a march through the convention hall, where delegates spent the day promoting labor solidarity and promising to end the 1980s, a tough decade for labor, on a positive and militant note. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>, addressing the convention a month after the Mine Workers ended 40 years of independence from the federation, sounded a warning that anti-union employers `` who looked upon the 1980s with great fondness are about to have their visions shattered in the 1990s because we will never be separated again.'' Federation President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, who first took office 10 years ago at the same hotel where the delegates are gathering this year, said the success of the labor movement in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and other nations in promoting democracy should serve as a lesson to those in this country who doubt the need for unions. `` Is it not reasonable to hope, at least, that American labor's movement toward democracy in the world will provide a new lesson for Americans regarding the role of trade unions in promoting and preserving freedom in our country? <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> asked. The delegates also received praise from Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who acknowledged the numerous policy differences between labor and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration but added, `` The tireless efforts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s unions have resulted in protection for all workers, regardless of whether they are union members.''

<HEAD>European Electrical Manufacturer To Buy Industrial Boiler Company</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Combustion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a maker of industrial boilers, says it will merge with a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> company that is the world's largest electrical equipment manufacturer in a $ 1.6 billion deal. <ORGANIZATION> ABB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boveri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> will buy Stamford-based Combustion Engineering for $ 40 per share, the companies announced Monday. The chief executives said the merger will join two firms that make complementary products for similar industries. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Combustion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION>'s shares surged $ 13.50 Monday to close at $ 39. It was the most active issue of the day, with nearly 5.6 million shares changing hands. <ORGANIZATION> ABB </ORGANIZATION>, with $ 20 billion in annual sales, supplies electrical equipment used in power generation, transmission and distribution, as well as equipment used in automation, transportation, environmental control and financial services. Combustion Engineering, with $ 3.5 billion in sales, makes boilers used in power plants, designs and constructs other types of plants and builds automated systems for factories. It also owns waste-to-energy plants in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and performs environmental cleanup services. `` The two companies are complementary in products, industry coverage and regional presence,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABB </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnevik </PERSON> and Combustion Engineering Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> said in a joint statement. The acquisition would be <ORGANIZATION> ABB </ORGANIZATION>'s second major deal announced this year. In September, it said it would pay $ 370 million to buy <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s 55 percent share of a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> ABB </ORGANIZATION> in power transmission and distribution. Earlier this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> considered but rejected a proposal to block the creation of the joint venture on grounds of too much overlap between the two companies. The merger announced Monday also will likely face scrutiny on antitrust grounds. But the chief executives said they are confident about the deal because the products and industries are complementary, not competitive. In addition, the noted, <ORGANIZATION> ABB </ORGANIZATION> sells primarily in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> while Combustion Engineering sells in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We're quite confident there's no show-stopper here,'' <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> said. The merger grew out of a discussion the executives had in August about the possibility of cooperative efforts in power generation. They decided a full merger would be the best way to proceed. Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> ABB </ORGANIZATION> will buy all outstanding shares of <ORGANIZATION> Combustion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> stock for $ 40 each, and assume $ 230 million in long-term debt on Combustion Engineering's books. <ORGANIZATION> ABB </ORGANIZATION> said the offer will not require financing. <PERSON> Barnevik </PERSON> said the merger would mean a greater commitment from <ORGANIZATION> ABB </ORGANIZATION> in the power and industrial markets. He also said the company's <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> American sales of $ 3 billion and staff of 15,000 would increase to $ 7 billion and 40,000 <ORGANIZATION> ABB </ORGANIZATION> only does about 1 percent of its business in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and Combustion Engineering even less. But the chief executives said they see the East Bloc nations as ripe for growth, especially in light of the pro-democracy movements in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and the opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall last week. `` The process in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is irreversible,'' said <PERSON> Barnevik </PERSON>, who said the companies' annual sales there could grow to $ 1 billion in a few years from the current $ 200 million. `` Marketplaces are coming together, country boundaries are coming down and we're simply heading for one world market,'' said <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON>, whose company in the last two years has announced two agreements to build plants and supply instrumentation and software in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> is no stranger to buyouts. He was non-executive chairman of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which means he was chairman of the board but not a company employee, during the <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> bidding war of 1988, and a director of <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> when it was sold to <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that same year. Combustion Engineering will retain its managers and <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> headquarters under the merger. <ORGANIZATION> ABB </ORGANIZATION> was formed in January 1988 as a partnership between <ORGANIZATION> ASEA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boveri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index recovered from an early setback and ended at a record high today, while the dollar closed marginally higher against the Japanese yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained a marginal 18.52 points, or 0.05 percent, ending at 35,768.64. It was yet another high. `` The index made nervous ups and downs during trading, because participants failed to determine the market direction,'' said <PERSON> Masaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashizume </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He said investors changed their buying targets from one issue to another, contributing to nervous fluctuations in the index. `` That's partly because many investors have been unsure about external factors including foreign exchange and interest rates,'' he said. Market players bought issues such as steels and electric power plants toward the end of the afternoon session, helping the index recover, <PERSON> Hashizume </PERSON> said. An estimated 900 million shares changed hands today, up from Monday's 750 million. The dollar closed unchanged from its opening at 143.80 yen, up 0.25 yen from Monday's close of 143.55 yen. The currency ranged between 143.60 yen and 143.85 yen. `` The dollar-yen rate stayed almost the same all day,'' a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said on condition of anonymity. After opening higher following a similar upswing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar fluctuated narrowly as investors sold and bought for profit-taking and position adjustments, he said. In earlier trading, the dollar fell as securities firms and foreign banks sold the currency for profit-taking, but it recovered in the afternoon as trading houses bought it, he said. `` At any rate, the currency would not move much prior to the auction of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government bonds and releases of a series of economic indicators this week,'' the trader said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to announce the nation's major economic indicators including the retail price index due out later today and revised trade figures for September, slated for Thursday.

Currency dealers said the dollar was stuck in a narrow range in quiet trading ahead of the release later today of October retail sales figures. `` The dollar is standing still ahead of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic data,'' said one trader in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. October industrial production and capacity utilization figures were also due to be released later in the day, followed by trade figures on Thursday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.25 yen to a closing 143.80 yen.

<TEXT>
 Agricultural businesses damaged by last month's <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake may get aid under the same program providing assistance to drought-affected farmers. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a bill on a voice vote Monday amending the Federal Disaster Assistance Act of 1989 to include speciality growers and processors hit by the earthquake. Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., sponsor of the bill that goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said many agriculture businesses `` slip through the safety net that our nation's disaster programs are supposed to provide. The earthquake that rocked <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> damaged fruit and ornamental trees, caused food processing plants to shut down in mid-harvest and disrupted work at wineries. The legislation provides reimbursement of 65 percent of the cost of replanting trees and seedlings. It also guarantees loans to agricultural businesses, increasing from $ 200 million to $ 300 million the amount that may be loaned through the program.

 The near destruction of 7,007 pounds of cooked roast beef led the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to pass legislation allowing courts that confiscate wholesome meat to donate it to charity. `` I introduced the bill to fill a void in the existing law,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. whose measure was approved on voice vote Monday The bill goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. It stems from a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> case known as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. 7,007 Pounds of Cooked Roast Beef, involving imported meat confiscated because it was fraudulently labeled `` USDA choice.'' Though inspected by a foreign agency trusted by the federal government, it had not been inspected by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> and could not be sold with a fraudulent <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> stamp. When the importer relinquished the meat and the suggestion was made that it be given to the needy, the federal court found that no provision for such action existed in the law. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the judge eventually got the meat to a food bank for the poor through creative interpretation of the law. `` We fed 35,000 people with this meat,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. His bill legalizes donation to charity as a means of disposing of confiscated meat. `` This legislation costs the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer no money and makes a significant contribution to fighting hunger in this country,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The enormous size of the nation's private pension system is frustrating government watchdogs, who warn that the retirement savings of millins of working Americans are vulnerable to fraud and mismanagement. The most alarming reports come from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general's office, which says failure to shore up the laws and bolster enforcement could result in a taxpayer-funded bailout dwarfing the recent savings and loan crisis `` There's an insidious and steady siphoning off, which ultimately affects the employees,'' says <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, acting inspector general for the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am convinced there is substantial fraud and abuse.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> investigation found that at least one-fourth of the private pension plans audited by the government are in violation of the law _ yet the odds of any individual program being checked are less than one in a hundred. The department has just 300 inspectors to police the nation's 870,000 private pension plans But instances of fraud and abuse that already have come to light are touching off alarms in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In some cases, pension administrators have siphoned off millions of dollars by underreporting earnings. In others, employers never made required contributions, with pensioners discovering only upon retirement that the money was missing. Still other companies have simply dumped their pension obligations on a government insurance program that already is $ 1.5 billion in the red. What makes the system most vulnerable, officials say, is its size. Frequently described as `` the largest lump of money in the world,'' the nation's private pension plans hold assets of $ 2 trillion, or roughly $ 8,000 for every man, woman and child in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Those funds cover some 76 million participants. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> audited 1,553 plans in 1989, with violations found in 492, or almost one-third. A similar rate was found in 1988 audits, after three years in which the violation rate was about 25 percent. The government is the final insurer of many private pension assets through the <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION>, which receives most of its funds from pension plan premiums, posted a $ 1.5 billion deficit in 1988, and a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study predicted that the corporation would be insolvent by 2001. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the stability of the insurance system, which the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> recently put on a list of high-risk programs. Most <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> claims have come from the beleaguered steel industry. But executive director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON> recently cautioned the corporation's deficit could double if the agency has to bail out the major airlines undergoing financial difficulties. `` If they go bust, the taxpayer picks up the bill _ just like the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON> of the inspector general's office. The government's ability to legislate pension safety is limited because the plans exist solely at the discretion of employers, who in some cases drop the retirement programs rather than reform them. Plus, only 40 million pensioners in 107,000 private plans are covered by the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the others have no insurance at all. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a public interest group, points out that detection of fraud is slim, with only about 1 percent of the submitted plans subject to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> audits. `` It's astonishing how much of the money is being stolen,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said. `` The pension money is sitting there and nobody's looking. In just one <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> case, investigators concluded that some $ 14 million had been stolen from two union locals by a broker and a financial adviser. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Renda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwimmer </PERSON> made the money by soliciting kickbacks on $ 100 million in investments. But the concern is by no means limited to large institutional programs. Ms. <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> says one typical case was found in a dentist's office. `` The receptionist wanted to retire but found the pension money was n't there,'' she explained. `` The dentist made loans to himself and invested in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> land.'' According to documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the inspector general's office in late 1987 investigated 168 pension and welfare plans and found $ 18.7 million in misused assets and administrative violations. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1974 enacted the Employment Retirement Income Securities Act, known as ERISA, to protect pension and welfare plan assets. The act established standards for how the plans were to be operated in the interests of the participants. Officials say the majority of big business pension funds are stable and well run. Nonetheless, the complexities of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA, coupled with the huge number of pensions leave many plans open to fraud. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, responsible for enforcing ERISA rules, has only 300 inspectors. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> wants to put more of the burden on private accountants, who under ERISA audit large plans yearly. He would require them to report any prohibited transactions directly to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. But the best way to avoid fraud and embezzlement, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> said, is to bring more criminal charges and fewer civil suits. `` I submit it is the jail term that is the deterrent, not the fine,'' he said. `` Today there's no stigma to being a defendant in a civil suit.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> conducted 5,000 investigations of pension and welfare benefit plans over the last three years, with just 95 classified as criminal. There were 26 convictions. The inspector general's Office of Labor Racketeering, in comparison, has obtained 179 criminal convictions since 1986. But that office is barred by a <ORGANIZATION> March </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> opinion from investigating non-union plans. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy secretary, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> <PERSON> DeArment </PERSON>, insists that `` pensioners should n't be alarmed.'' `` We do n't have a savings and loan crisis in the pension industry,'' he said. Still, <PERSON> DeArment </PERSON> said he is carefully looking at the inspector general's reports. Even though he does n't believe the system is about to collapse, `` that does n't mean we should n't address the potential,'' he said. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, an aide to Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the warnings can not be ignored `` We took some heat, especially with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said, noting that internal reports outlined problems in that agency years before they attracted widespread attention. `` <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> sensitized us to IG reports.'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>' government operations subcommittee held a hearing in August with further meetings scheduled, most likely early next year. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, will hold a hearing this week in his Select Committee on Aging. `` When similar warnings were ignored about the savings and loan industry and about <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> program administration, the cost to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer and to our economy became staggering,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said.

 The husband and wife team that led <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> were forced out of the company after more than 30 years, sources say, by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which acquired the company in a $ 1.2 billion leveraged buyout. The company announced Monday that <PERSON> Avram </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> resigned as chairman and chief executive officer, and his wife <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabb </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, daughter of company founder, <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabb </PERSON>, resigned as president and chief operating officer. The Goldbergs led the sale of the company 18 months ago to <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> leveraged buyout specialist, to block a hostile takeover attempt by <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, who bid $ 4.6 billion for the company. `` I was shocked,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, executive vice president of the Griffin Report of <LOCATION> Weymouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, which tracks food companies. `` They continue to open new stores, and everything seemed to be fine,'' he said of the Goldbergs resigning. `` The surprise is the abruptness and immediacy of it.'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaeneman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who has been with <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Shop for 22 years and has been president and chief executive officer of the supermarket division since 1980, was named the new chairman. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON>, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the supermarket division, was appointed the new president. The Goldbergs, whose salaries totaled more than $ 1 million last year, own 1.15 percent of the newly formed private company. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified source as saying that `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> never liked <PERSON> Avram </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>.'' `` He always thought they were running it more like family and not as professional managers. The business never should have been sold to <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>. It was a terrible mistake,'' the source said. `` This is the busy season, and <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> wants leadership that leads,'' another unnamed source told the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. That newspaper also quoted sources saying there had been growing friction between the Goldbergs and <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and that the investor group decided to oust the Goldbergs and put in managers who would `` do things the way <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> wanted to do them.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> had no comment on the allegations. The changes come in the midst of the 75th anniversary observance of the company, the largest supermarket chain in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The supermarket division has 116 stores in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Its <ORGANIZATION> Bradlees </ORGANIZATION> division has 131 discount department stores in eight states. The supermarket division reportedly took in 17.5 percent of the money spent on food in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> last year, compared with 16 percent the previous year. The Bradlees division, however, sold its 35 stores in the deep South. The company lost $ 21 million last year, largely because of the buyout cost, on sales of $ 4.6 billion. Operating profit was $ 160 million compared with $ 117 million in 1987. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabb </PERSON> founded the company in 1914, and family management continued long after the company went public in 1923.

 Retail sales, held back by a sluggish automobile market, fell 1 percent in October for their first decline in eight months, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said overall sales dropped to a seasonally adjusted $ 144.5 billion last month after rising 0.9 percent in August and 0.7 percent in September. The last time retail sales fell was in February, when they dropped 0.4 percent. They were unchanged in June. The October decline was the largest since a 6.7 percent drop in January 1987. In other October reports, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said that industrial production fell 0.7 percent, due in part to the effects of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake and a strike in the aircraft industry. The operating rate for factories, mines and utilities fell 0.8 percentage points to 82.8 percent. Retail sales account for about one-third of the nation's economic activity and are watched as a sign of the extent to which the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of fighting inflation by tightening credit is slowing the economy Auto sales, lacking major incentive programs during the month, plunged 5.1 percent in October. Car sales, which represent about 20 percent of retail total, had been propped up by incentives for much of the year and rose 0.5 percent in September and 2.2 percent in August. The October decline was the largest since auto sales fell 26.5 percent in January 1987. Excluding the automobile category, retail sales edged up 0.2 percent. Sales of durable goods _ items expected to last at least three years _ fell 2.7 percent, their steepest fall since a 2.8 percent decline in October 1987. Durable sales were flat in September after gaining 2 percent in August. The durable goods market has been particularly hit by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s interest-rate policies because sales often are financed by loans Sales of building materials rose 0.9 percent after falling 1.3 percent in September and advancing 1.7 percent in August. Furniture and other home furnishing sales edged up 0.3 percent following a 0.6 percent drop in September and a 1.6 percent gain in August. Sales of nondurable goods edged up 0.1 percent, following a 1.1 percent gain in September and a 0.1 percent decline in August. Nondurable categories showing increases were department stores, up 0.3 percent; grocery stores, 1 percent; apparel, 0.2 percent; and drug stores, 1 percent. Nondurable categories posting declines were gasoline stations, down 0.9 percent, and restaurants and bars, off 0.2 percent. For the three months from August through October, overall retail sales were up 6.3 percent. Sales for the first 10 months of 1989 were up 6 percent over the same period of 1988.

 Stock prices pushed ahead this morning as hopes persisted that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will pursue a more generous credit policy to spur economic growth. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.31 to 2,630.74 by 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Advancing issues outpaced declines on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with 590 up, 393 down and 516 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 20.37 million shares after the first 30 minutes of trading. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 0.39 to 188.61. Market watchers say stocks got a lift from several reports released before trading began today that furnished fresh evidence of an economic slowdown. However, analysts said the statistics did n't paint a completely clear picture because they were influenced by special circumstances. Retail sales dropped 1 percent in October, the first decline since February. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said a slumping automobile market depressed total retail sales. Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> reported industrial production fell 0.7 percent in October. A strike in the aircraft industry and the impact of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake crimped overall output. Traders have been hoping that the central bank will decide the sluggish economy needs the stimulation that lower interest rates would provide. In the early going, <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> led the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s list of actively traded issue and gained -LRB- to 23 -RCB-. On Monday the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average eked out a 0.82 gain to 2,626.43. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, with 806 up, 661 down and 479 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 140.75 million shares, against 131.80 million in the previous session.

 The Japanese are adding to their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> real estate portfolio the 66-year-old Biltmore Hotel, where the Oscar was dreamed up, it was reported today. T.A.T <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which is made up of two Japanese firms, will pay <ORGANIZATION> Biltmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> $ 219 million for the recently renovated, 700-room hotel and a 24-story office tower opened two years ago, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said, citing unidentified sources.

 <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to buy <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nekoosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> shifted back to federal court in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where Great Northern today responded to lawsuits challenging regulations that make a takeover difficult legally and financially. Great Northern, denying that anti-takeover provisions of its by-laws were designed to entrench management at shareholder expense, said it was ironic that <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> itself has a shareholder rights plan and supermajority voting rules similar to the ones it is challenging in court. `` The directors of corporations which take such steps _ the directors of Great Northern no less than the directors of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> _ act lawfully and responsibly when they take steps of this nature that are reasonably calculated to promote the best interests of the company and its shareholders in the context of a proposed takeover,'' the Great Northern response said. Great Northern, which is headquartered in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> but incorporated in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, filed the papers in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Great Northern, a <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, Conn.-based paper products company, on Monday rejected <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 3.13 billion takeover bid, saying it was too low and would be financially disastrous for both companies. Great Northern also filed an antitrust suit against <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, a forest products company based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, harshly criticized Great Northern's directors for voting Sunday to reject the $ 58-a-share bid made Oct. 30 <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, challenged the antitrust allegations, saying the offer represented a 50 percent premium above the market price of the stock before takeover speculation drove up prices. Great Northern's stock closed down 75 cents Monday at $ 61.37 -LCB- a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> shares fell 25 cents to $ 46.37 -LCB-. `` The board has put forth specious arguments in order to reject a legitimate and negotiable proposal without offering any alternative that meets its responsibilities to shareholders or the company's future,'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said in a statement. He said the company would continue to try to meet with the board and management, and `` pursue all necessary courses of action to successfully realize the best interests of all concerned.'' But Great Northern Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON> said the companies were not talking. `` <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> does n't talk to us except through the courts at this stage of the game,'' he said, referring to both the antitrust suit in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and the takeover suit in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where Great Northern is incorporated. Great Northern, which had sales of $ 3.6 billion last year, makes paper products, lumber and plywood at mills and factories in six states. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> had $ 9.5 billion in sales from paper, forest products and building materials. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> proposed buying 54 million outstanding shares of <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> stock in a deal that would cost $ 4.5 billion, including refinancing, fees and expenses. The paper industry is heading for a downturn after three strong years, as overcapacity from expansion puts pressure on paper prices. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said financing the acquisition would require no layoffs or sales of assets, and would allow the company to continue spending on capital projects. But <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON> said the directors believed Great Northern was solid financially and well situated to stand alone and pursue its long-term business agenda, which includes expansion.

 Directors of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have instructed their financial adviser to explore alternatives to an investor group's attempt to dump the board and take control of the airline company <ORGANIZATION> Condor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> presented <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, with the necessary documents Monday to gain access to the company's list of stockholders to begin its solicitation of shareowners After a meeting later in the day, the board issued a statement saying it had authorized its financial adviser, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to `` explore potential transactions with third parties, including actively determining available alternative'' deals such as employee ownership or recapitalization. The board said it had not received an offer from Condor or any third party. But <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, one of Condor's three general partners, said the board has misrepresented his group's position. `` We never said we were going to put forth a proposal until being elected to the board,'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said. `` We feel that we need to be on the board to be in a position to act on behalf of the company.'' <PERSON> Condor </PERSON> was formed as a takeover vehicle by <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, which announced Nov. 3 that it had acquired 9.7 percent of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s immediate objective is to reduce <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board from 16 members to five, three of whom would be <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s principals. The other two are current board members <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, president and chief executive officer, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> But the company said Monday both have indicated they're not interested in serving on a board controlled by <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s shares closed Monday at $ 193.25, up $ 3.75 in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. It was one month ago, on Oct. 13, that a pilot-management effort to buy the company for $ 300 a share collapsed for lack of financing. Analysts say speculators want to see <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> sold or recapitalized quickly to minimize their losses from that setback. `` If I were on the board, I would assume that there are sufficient shares held by accounts sympathetic to <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> that would result in a majority vote against the board,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Buttrick </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced a long-delayed set of data-storage devices on Tuesday and revealed that the expensive delay was caused by internal problems, not a supplier. The delay from the original July announcement date contributed to a 30 percent drop in the computer giant's third-quarter earnings. Disk drives for storing data from mainframe computers account for about a tenth of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s roughly $ 60 billion in annual revenue. Some analysts had speculated that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s trouble came from a flawed part from an outside supplier. But <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said it was a chemistry problem that caused magnetic particles from a 10-inch platter to cling to a read-write head, a microscopic version of the common problem of dirty heads on a tape recorder. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> solved the problem by using a different chemistry for the thin `` raspberry jam'' layer of material that covers the magnetic particles on the platter, according to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Low </PERSON>, president of the General Products Division. The new chemistry completely solved the problem and the new 3390 disk drives are the most reliable in the industry, he said. The new drives can do three times the work in one-third the floor space of models introduced just two years ago, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said the disk drives will be shipped beginning Dec. 1 and that the company expects to increase production enough to meet customer demand by the April-June quarter of next year. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 877 million in the third quarter, down from $ 1.25 billion a year earlier.

 A Republican leader of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel investigating the generic drug scandal says he fears the departure of Food and Drug Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> will delay needed changes at the agency. But others on Capitol Hill welcome the change at the government's principal consumer protection agency, with one consumer group calling Young `` by far the worst <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> commissioner'' in the past 18 years. Young, who has been <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> commissioner since July 1984, will leave the agency next month to take another top position within the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. The new job, deputy assistant secretary for health handling science and environmental matters, is an expansion of a vacant post in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee, said <PERSON> Young </PERSON> `` was part of the solution, not part of the problem'' at <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> He said he feared <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s departure would be a setback in efforts to make needed reforms at the agency. The department has not announced a replacement for Young. But unlike <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and his predecessors who were appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> secretary, the next <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> commissioner will have to be confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which could lengthen the time it will take for a replacement to take over. Sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they believed <PERSON> Young </PERSON> was being forced out in the fallout over the scandal that uncovered fraud, corruption and mismanagement within the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s generic drug division and the generic industry Department officials, however, discounted the speculation as unfounded rumor and said <PERSON> Young </PERSON> was eager to take the new job, even though the move is a lateral one. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the panel, said he did n't blame Young for the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s generic drug problems, which led to bribery convictions of several <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> employees and drug company officials along with disclosures that some companies cheated on product safety tests `` His intentions were good and he did his best when problems were brought to light. But he was handicapped by the budgets and attitudes of an administration that let the agency go to seed,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said. But Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on human resources, said: `` Under extreme pressure from the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan-Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> oversaw the erosion of <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> as an independent watchdog agency. As a result, the American public has lost the confidence in <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to protect consumers from unsafe foods and drugs.'' Dr. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, called Young `` by far the worst <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> commissioner in the 18 years since <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> and I started the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said <PERSON> Young </PERSON> `` has been more concerned with protecting the industries <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is supposed to regulate than in protecting the public from these industries.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is one of the most visible government agencies, responsible for assuring the safety of drugs, cosmetics and most food products. Department officials denied that the generic drug scandal had anything to do with the changes. In fact, the department's announcement that <PERSON> Young </PERSON> will move into the new position Dec. 18 praised his handling of the generic drug problems `` All of the rumors are just that _ typical <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> nonsense,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Mack Reports $87.5 Million Loss for Third Quarter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Mack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> today reported a third-quarter loss of $ 87.5 million, as sales in the heavy-duty truck market continued to soften. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meck </PERSON>, executive vice president of finance and chief financial officer, said <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> expects losses to continue through the fourth quarter and possibly into 1990. The third-quarter loss, at $ 2.94 per share, came on sales of $ 367.4 million. In the same period a year ago, <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> earned $ 2.7 million, or 9 cents a share, on $ 501 million in revenue. For the first nine months of 1989, <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> reported a loss of $ 105.9 million, or $ 3.57 a share, compared with a net profit of $ 18 million, or 61 cents a share, in the same 1988 period. Revenue totaled $ 1.4 billion, down from $ 1.6 billion a year earlier. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> officials said recent losses were due to a downturn in the heavy-duty truck market, problems with introducing new products, and the high costs of liquidating used vehicles and warranties. The number of Mack-produced heavy-duty vehicles sold in the third quarter was 34 percent lower than in the same period a year ago, the company said. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s new chairman and chief executive officer, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reins </PERSON>, said the company was facing one of the most difficult periods in the company's 89-year history. `` <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> has taken a number of actions during recent months to eliminate expenses, cut back on capital expenditures and reduce inventory levels,'' Reins said. `` However, it is clear that further actions are needed to improve <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s competitiveness. A new <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> will emerge from this effort, a leaner company, a tougher competitor.'' In August alone, the company announced more than 600 layoffs at plants in <LOCATION> Waynesboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hagerstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Santanasto </PERSON>. He said he did not know the exact number of layoffs, but said the company's workforce would be reduced by 21 percent in the last six months of 1989. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s former chairman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON>, resigned in October as the company announced it expected to lose about $ 50 million in the third quarter. <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON> lost the position of president to Reins in June when the company announced expected second-quarter losses, and the chief executive position to Reins in September. The push to remove <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON> was apparently led by <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION>'s truck operations, which owns about 45 percent of <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s stock and has four directors on <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s 10-member board.

<TEXT>
 Share prices finished mixed Tuesday in modest dealing on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, but a key index edged higher after buyers zeroed in on selected sectors of the market. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index settled 1.5 points, or 0.07 percent, higher at 2,214.7, nearly midway between its intraday low of 2,206.6 and its best level of the day of 2,223.3. Dealers said the market initially recovered from its opening losses on futures-related buying which boosted the 100-share index to its session high within the first two hours of trading. The index, along with the overall market, was locked in relatively narrow trading ranges throughout the remainder of the session. Wall Street's choppy opening did little to provide <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with any substantive direction in its late transactions, dealers said. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index ended 0.6 points lower at 1,770.8. Volume was a moderate 334.4 million shares traded, higher than Monday's turnover of 288.5 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index was 1,215.75, down 0.28.

 The dollar fell Tuesday against most major currencies in moderate European trading after the release of disappointing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic data. Gold prices also fell. Dealers said the dollar was knocked down by steeper-than-expected falls in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail sales and industrial production for October. Retail sales fell 1 percent last month, compared with a predicted 0.8 percent decline, and production output dropped by 0.7 percent compared with a projected 0.2 percent fall. Dealers said the market's reaction was restrained before Thursday's scheduled release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade figures for September. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose 0.25 Japanese yen to a closing 143.80 yen. Lat to encourage such spending by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and business. `` If you engage in any activity in our country, others will emulate your example,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` The world is awaiting your signal, it is watching you. Do not let the world and us wait any longer.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> offered the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> repeated thanks and praise for assistance dating back to just after the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard strike he led in 1981 to Solidarity's forced underground days, when the federation provided an estimated $ 5 million worth of communications equipment and other supplies. `` You have proven to be our most steadfast allies in the trade union struggle for human freedom,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in the text of his speech, saying others who have endorsed Solidarity's cause have not backed up their rhetoric with help. `` Sometimes we feel as if we are swimming chained hand and foot, trying to summon all our energy just to make it safely to shore,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` And on the shore there is a cheering crowd of people who offer us their admiration instead of simply throwing a life belt. We want to make it to the shore, to join the community of democratic countries with efficient economies.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> recalled the emigration of Poles to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in search of freedom and said he had `` traveled across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> just to tell you that hope has found its way to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> too. For the first time in several dozen years, Poles can feel the breeze of freedom in their own country _ the breeze many people once had to seek on this side of the ocean.'' He warned that if the new Solidarity-led government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> fails to revive the economy, more than <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new democracy and people would suffer, and that success depended on help from abroad. `` If we fail to convince people that although things are changing slowly they are nevertheless changing for the better, then this breeze of freedom I spoke of will soon disappear, leaving behind only a sense of bitterness accompanying unaccomplished dreams,'' he said. `` It will result in a defeat for us, but not only for us.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday, `` I'm full of admiration for your country, not because it's a big power and not because it's rich, even though one could envy that I admire <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as a country of freedom,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> moved <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to tears recalling how he `` made the sign of the cross on the foreheads of his sleeping children'' before Polish police took him away in 1981 for 11 months during the martial law crackdown on Solidarity. Now, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> have been disproved, not by presidents or princes, but by the likes of an electrician from <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> and his fellow workers in a brave union called Solidarity. `` The Iron Curtain is fast becoming a rusted, abandoned relic. ...

 Sales of the nation's Big Three automakers' North American-built cars and light trucks continued a downward spiral in early November, falling 22.4 percent from last year, the companies reported Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said they sold an average of 24,094 vehicles a day from Nov. 1-10 this year, compared with 31,038 a day during the same time last year. Car sales were off 26.2 percent and truck sales were down 16.2 percent for the Big Three. The sales continued a trend begun in the first 10-day reporting period of October, as the 1990 model year opened. Analysts had forecast slumping car and truck sales during the fourth quarter of this year because carbuyers headed to the showrooms weeks before to avoid 1990-model price increases and to take advantage of incentive programs on 1989 models. Those programs have been whittled for 1990 vehicles. In October, car and light truck sales by the Big Three were down 14.1 percent from the year before. That slump pushed October's retail sales down 1 percent, the first decline in eight months The early-November sales pace of 24,094 vehicles a day was 17 percent below the 29,016 vehicle-a-day sales pace during the same period a month ago. So far this year, car and truck sales by the Big Three were running 4.3 percent behind last year's pace. Car sales were down 6.2 percent and truck sales were off 1.1 percent. In early November, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> posted the largest decline in car sales, dropping 29.1 percent from the year-ago period. Light truck sales reported by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> were 20.9 percent below last year's pace. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were off 7.3 percent while truck sales were up a slim 0.3 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s early-November car sales were down 23.5 percent and truck sales were off 14.3 percent compared with last year. Year-to-date car sales at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> were down 1.6 percent and truck sales were running 3.2 percent behind the year-to-date pace last year. Sales of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s cars were down 22.5 percent for the period, and light truck sales were down 9.9 percent. Car sales this year were running 11.6 percent behind last year's pace and truck sales were down 0.6 percent.

 Victims of the worst thrift failure in history told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee today they were duped into investing their life savings in what they were told were federally insured securities, only to learn later they were worthless junk bonds. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickman </PERSON>, 78, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> she and her 80-year-old husband were devastated when they were told earlier this year their $ 25,000 in bonds sold through <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and issued by its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, was lost. `` When a senior citizen loses their life savings, it is not only the money they lose, but something more important,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Wickman </PERSON> said in a barely audible voice. `` They have failed _ themselves, their children, their families and also in tomorrow, believing there is nothing left for them to believe in.'' The Wickmans are among 22,000 people, mostly <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-area </LOCATION> retirees, who state and federal officials say were targeted by <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> to switch nearly $ 200 million of federally insured deposits into junk bonds after federal examiners first recommended closing the S & amp; L in May 1987. Those bonds became virtually worthless when <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> declared bankruptcy last April, one day before the government finally seized its <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> subsidiary which had lost an estimated $ 2 billion in savers' federally insured deposits. The government last month filed a $ 1.1 billion suit against <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s owner, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> charging fraud and racketeering. Meanwhile, both the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> are investigating whether five senators who received $ 1.3 million in political contributions from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> intervened with federal regulators in keeping <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> open for two years after government examiners recommended closing it down. The five senators _ <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich.; and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION> _ all have But Mrs. <PERSON> Wickman </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, held <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> responsible for what she described as a fraud that could make her parents destitute in the near future. Over the past three years, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> has contributed a total of $ 974,000 in either campaign funds to <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> or to voter registration and other political causes headed by members of <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s family. Among the items being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is whether any of that money was illegally diverted from <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> depositors' accounts. `` They found it so painfully hard to believe that Senator <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, a man whom they had supported and voted for during many years, had received part of his hard-earned dollars carefully saved each weeks for 30 years,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said of her parents. `` The ` gentlemen' _ Mr. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, Mr. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and others from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> _ have not even had the decency to show a simple courtesy and answer one of the many letters we have written to them in the past year,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee, which has been holding hearings into <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> for a month, heard from three other investors whose savings were lost as it turned its investigation to the roles of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and private accounting firms in the alleged fraud. `` What truly hurts in this situation is that 90 percent of the debentures were peddled to the public ... long after the alarm bells had gone off at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, the nation's top thrift regulator who, as the bank board's chairman since 1987, has been the target of the panel's probe says he has no intention of resigning amid indications he may be lossing support from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration `` I've had no indication either way from the president,'' <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, told reporters Monday in response to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remark that he has not ruled out replacing <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in an interview with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> reporters last Friday, said he intended to respond `` fairly soon'' to a request last month by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, to replace Wall. `` I'm not closing the door on it; I just do n't know at this juncture,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But when the question is put: ` If part of the savings and loan problem proves to be management or regulation people that are n't aggressive enough, would you make changes?,' the answer is yes.'' Wall, a former banking aide to Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, said Monday that he interprets those remarks as an indication the president wants to hear both sides before making any judgment. `` The president ... knows that one is innocent until proven guilty,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said, reiterating complaints that <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has repeatedly postponed his appearance before the panel. `` Certainly one has to have an opportunity to respond to the questions that are raised.''

<HEAD>Colorado Developing Favorable Image In Japan, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Japanese company's decision to build a sake plant near here is a sign that <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> is becoming well known in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a state economic development official says. `` I think there's a growing awareness of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> in the minds of the Japanese citizens,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blansett </PERSON>, who is a business development representative for the state's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. `` <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> is gaining a favorable image. They're beginning to equate it with the mountains, the clean water and environment in general,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Tatsuuma-Honke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which brews a sake called <LOCATION> Hakushika </LOCATION>, is purchasing an eight-acre parcel for the brewery in the <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> It plans to break ground on a $ 7 million, 50,000-square-foot plant in April. When in operation, the plant will employ about 50 people, including 30 from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. The company began looking at <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> sites about a year ago, and signed the deal in September, said officials at <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is selling the land to <LOCATION> Tatsuuma </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tatsuuma </PERSON> will compete with four other Japanese sake brewers for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, the officials say. Most of the companies are building plants in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Tatsuuma officials chose <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> because they thought a plant here would preserve a niche, Coors officials said. `` From the beginning, they really wanted to differentiate themselves from their competitors,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>' vice president for corporate real estate. `` The quality of water was the most important thing to them.'' Tatsuuma officials wanted `` the quality first, and a good relationship with the community,'' added <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Garbini </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>' director of corporate property development Economic development officials believe <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> eventually may emerge as a bigger lure for Japanese tourism and investment than the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Dow Jones Plans to Offer Financial News by Phone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dow Jones & amp; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it is introducing an interactive 900-number telephone service that will enable callers to get stock quotes, business and financial news, sports reports and weather conditions <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, plans to charge 85 cents for the first minute and 75 cents for each additional minute for calls to its service, called JournalPhone. The service begins operation Wednesday and will be promoted each weekday with advertising in the Journal. Its creators called the service `` a logical extension'' of the newspaper. `` It picks up where the Journal leaves off and offers an easy, convenient way to keep on top of the news as it develops throughout the day,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burenga </PERSON>, a senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION>. Callers who want to find out at mid-morning what the latest government indicators showed, for example, can hear a recorded report by dialing 1-900-JOURNAL and pushing the appropriate telephone buttons as prompted by the service. When callers have heard enough, they can push a few more buttons and obtain 15-minute delayed quotes on any of 6,500 stock prices; regularly updated reports on the overall stock, bond or currency markets; information about weather in selected cities; or reports on sports stories or scores. The calls will be charged on regular monthly phone bills. Dow Jones is not the first newspaper publisher to provide telephone services, although its service may offer the widest array of reports. A number of newspapers, for instance, provide sports scores by telephone for the cost of a local telephone call. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> provides four call-in services on 900-numbers, including hotlines for sports information and scores, weather reports, lottery results and horse racing results <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuhrer </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION>, said the sports hotline receives 2.7 million calls a year at 60 cents for the first minute and 45 cents for each minute after that. `` It extends our coverage to 24 hours a day,'' he said. Dow Jones executives said they were not sure how many calls to expect on their new service. It tested the service for three months this past summer in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where about 10,000 Journal readers were invited to use the system for free. The test showed the average calls lasted about two minutes. The company already provides a more expensive interactive telephone service for active traders and plans to use the same staff and facilities for its new service which is geared more toward average investors. Dow Jones expects the new service to be profitable from the start.

<HEAD>Strike, Earthquake Drive Down Overall Factory Output</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The economy's sluggish manufacturing sector was hammered by an aircraft strike and an earthquake last month which pounded industrial production down 0.7 percent to its lowest level in three and a half years, the government reported Tuesday. But the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said that without the strike at the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the disruptive effects of the earthquake, `` the total index would have been nearly unchanged in October, continuing its recent sluggish trend.'' Nevertheless, the decline was the steepest since a 1.3 percent drop in March 1986. Industrial production was unchanged in September and has shown weakness in recent months as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> kept a tight grip on credit to slow the economy and curb inflation. The October output was foreshadowed by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report earlier this month of a loss of 13,000 manufacturing jobs in October, a drop in the average manufacturing work week and virtually no factory overtime But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the sluggishness was worsened by the strike, which added 0.4 percent to the decline, and the earthquake, which added another 0.2 percent. `` If you take into account the special factors, we were down just 0.1 percent,'' he said. `` That is much more consistent with the pattern of proceeding months in which the industrial sector is showing weakness while the others, particularly the service sector, are holding up well.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said fairly steady consumer spending coupled with a weak manufacturing sector indicates `` a little bit of a two-tier economy showing up again similar to what we had earlier in this economic expansion.'' But while the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s interest-rate policies were having an adverse effect on some segments of the economy, another report indicated it was being successful in keeping inflation in check. In that report, the central bank said the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities fell 0.8 percentage point to 82.8 percent in October. Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or more to be inflationary because it could lead to shortages and thus higher prices. Factory use had dipped in September to 83.6 percent from 83.8 percent in August. The rate posted 10-year highs of 84.3 percent last December and January. Industrial production at manufacturing plants making both durable and nondurable goods was down 0.8 percent in October after falling 0.2 percent in September and rising 0.4 percent in July. Durable manufacturing was off 1.5 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent drop in September and a 0.4 percent gain in August. Nondurable manufacturing rose 0.1 percent after declining 0.1 percent in September and rising 0.1 percent in August. Output was unchanged at mines, compared with gains of 2.1 percent in September and 0.6 percent the previous month. Output at utilities was up 0.5 percent following a 1.2 percent advance in September and a decline of 0.7 percent in August. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said its industrial production index in October stood at 141.4 percent of its 1977 base, down from 142.4 percent a month earlier. At the same time, it said the manufacturing-plant operating rate fell from 83.7 percent in September to 82.8 percent last month. The rate had peaked at 84.7 percent in January. The rate at factories producing durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last more than three years _ dropped 1.4 percentage point to 80.9 percent. The rate at factories producing nondurable goods was off 0.2 percentage point to 85.5 percent. The operating rate at mines was up 0.1 percentage point to 84.6, while it rose 0.4 percentage point to 81.2 percent at utilities.

<HEAD>Farm Credit System Reports Quarterly Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Farm Credit System reported Tuesday that its third quarter profit jumped 42 percent over a year ago. The system said it netted $ 139 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with earnings of $ 98 million in the 1988 period. For the first nine months of this year, it earned $ 457 million, vs. $ 434 million the previous year. <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the financing arm of the farm credit system, attributed the improvements largely to higher net interest income and fewer loan losses. Net interest income totaled $ 236 million for the third quarter, up from $ 211 million last year, and to $ 732 million for the nine-month period, up from $ 571 million. The system said that net interest income increased as a result of continued improvement in the credit quality of its loan portfolio stemming from a reduction in nonaccrual loans. When loans are placed on nonaccrual status they are accounted for only as they come in rather than when they are due. The system's non-earning assets, which consist of nonaccrual loans and other property owned, declined 21 percent to $ 3.14 billion during the first nine months of 1989. The Farm Credit System is a nationwide system of federally chartered agricultural lending institutions serving the rural econ The system took several steps last year to streamline its structure following 1987 legislation that included the issuance of up to $ 4 billion in government-backed, low-interest loans.

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> after a quiet session. Prices had opened lower across the board, reflecting disappointment over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s cancellation of a wheat purchase and a slackening of export activity. But the corn and soybean markets rallied at midday and finished mostly higher. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that private exporters had reported cancellation of sales of 300,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that had been slated for delivery in the 1990-91 crop year, which begins June. 1. In addition to its impact on the wheat market, the cancellation revived fears that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may be forced to cancel some of its recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn purchases due to jammed shipping routes. `` The wheat cancellation brings us back to the reality that sales can be canceled,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Biedermann </PERSON>, director of research for <ORGANIZATION> Allendale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a futures brokerage in <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. At the close, wheat futures were -LCB- cent to 3 cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.00 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.40 a bushel; oats were \ cent to -RCB- cent higher with December at $ 1.44 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 2 -LCB- cents higher with November at $ 5.79 a bushel

<HEAD>Soybean Farmers' Lawsuit Accuses BOT of Illegal Price Manipulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Family farmers who say they suffered severe financial losses from a <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> order last summer filed a federal class-action lawsuit Tuesday, accusing the exchange of illegally manipulating soybean prices. The lawsuit seeking more than $ 100 million in damages was filed by individual farmers from leading soybean-producing states and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a lobbying group that represents small farmers and rural business people in 34 states. The Board of Trade denied the allegations, which stem from its emergency action July 11 ordering traders to reduce their holdings in soybean futures contracts. The order caused a 20 percent drop in soybean prices and corresponding declines in other commodities, the <ORGANIZATION> AAM </ORGANIZATION> said. The board's move was widely viewed as an effort to break up an alleged attempt to corner the market by <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanziaria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, an Italian company and one of the world's largest soybean processors. `` The <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION>'s order was a bad faith and self-serving action initiated by the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION>'s dominant grain merchants and futures traders to create profits for their accounts and for their clients,'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanner </PERSON>, AAM's president and an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> soybean farmer. <PERSON> Sanner </PERSON> spoke at a news conference at a downtown hotel, accompanied by about 25 other farmers from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> _ many of whom said they had been devastated by the board action. `` I'm angry as hell about what has been done to we as producers of this nation,'' said <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a soybean farmer from <LOCATION> Brownville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, and an AAM member. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the order caused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers `` in excess of a $ 50 billion loss on corn and about $ 27 billion in beans.'' The lawsuit names as defendants the exchange, <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> and 21 other directors, and five other exchange officials. After the news conference, the group _ carrying banners and buckets of soybeans _ marched five blocks to the Board of Trade, where they had hoped to meet with exchange officials. <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> said officials were in meetings and refused to let the farmers enter the building. He agreed to take the soybeans to exchange officials as a symbol of their complaint. In a news release, <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said exchange officials had not seen the lawsuit, but are `` confident in the action taken ... by the board of directors to maintain an orderly liquidation in our July 1989 soybean futures contract.'' He said board officials `` expect this lawsuit to be proven frivolous and do not believe it will be of any benefit to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture community.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> vindicated our action in their testimony before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> supporting the exchange's decision to maintain orderly markets,'' he said The board's order required the liquidation of large positions in its July soybean futures contracts. The exchange said it issued the order to make <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> reduce its holdings in soybean futures contracts. The Board of Trade was widely criticized by farm groups and traders who saw the value of their futures holdings drop when soybean futures prices fell sharply July 12. AAM attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said the lawsuit was filed on behalf of all farmers hurt by the order, `` about 95 percent'' of the nation's growers, but that anyone can `` opt out'' if they choose

 Pressure from the investment group <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> is forcing <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> toward a sale of the airline company, possibly to a successor to the employee-management coalition that failed with an earlier bid, analysts said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> turned up the heat Monday with the first formal step in its bid to oust 13 of the 15 <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> directors. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board responded by re-emphasizing its determination to maximize shareholder value and authorizing its financial adviser to `` explore potential transactions with third parties.'' Some industry analysts interpreted the company's statement as a clear indication that <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, is for sale. `` They' v <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Churchill-Coleman would not state categorically that it was the work of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, but he said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> had been carrying out a bombing campaign on the British mainland for 14 months and `` this appears to be that kind of device.'' <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, a painter, said he spotted an 18-inch-long lunch box under a blue Mercedes on Monday while working at a house on the tree-lined street in the fashionable <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, about a mile from <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> where Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> live. `` It just instinctively struck me as suspicious. There was something not quite right ... and I thought it best to call the police,'' said <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, 19. Police evacuated the area for three hours while the bomb squad defused the device. The owner of the Mercedes turned out to be <PERSON> Veravat </PERSON> <PERSON> Chotiros </PERSON>, the British manager of <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, whose wife said the car had not been used for days. `` Quite obviously, this was a case of mistaken identity,'' <PERSON> Chotiros </PERSON> said. `` My family and I are much relieved that the device was detected and made safe and that no injuries resulted from the incident.'' Defense sources said the bombers were wrong on a second front: <LOCATION> Ramsbotham </LOCATION>, based mainly at <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, is chauffeured to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in a military vehicle. `` I think he realized that being a target was part of the job and just shrugged it off,'' said <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce-Gardyne </PERSON>, who lives next door and whose husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, is a <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> peer. She said the general and his wife, Sue, have not been home for two weeks. <PERSON> Ramsbotham </PERSON> commanded the 39th Infantry Brigade based at <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> between 1978 and 1980. He has been widely rumored to be up for the army's top job, chief of the general staff. The discovery fueled speculation of an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> pre-Christmas bombing campaign on the British mainland. <PERSON> Churchill-Coleman </PERSON> warned those at risk to be extra vigilant, particularly with their cars. On Sept. 22, an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb killed 11 men at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in Deal on <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s southeast coast.

But the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> carried out a triple bombing at a barracks near <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on Feb. 20, slightly injuring one soldier.

Perhaps hottest of all at the Comdex show are <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s six-pound, notebook-size LTE and LTE286 machines. `` Sales have been very good, I would say better than expected,'' <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Canion </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive, said in an interview. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s machines are the first of their size to accept the 3 -LCB- - inch floppy disks that are standard in many desktop computers That's more convenient than other machines that use memory cards or smaller disks. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> officials say they have struggled to meet demand in the month since they introduced the LTE, which begins at about $ 2,400, and the LTE286, which runs on a faster 80286 microprocessor and lists for $ 3,900 to $ 5,000. <PERSON> Canion </PERSON> said the only compromise was on the screen, which is less sharp than the one on <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s 14-pound Macintosh Portable. `` What we found was that most people would trade off that -LRB- screen -RRB- in return for the small size,'' <PERSON> Canion </PERSON> said. Among the competing high-performance notebook-size computers is the <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ultralite </ORGANIZATION>, a pioneer when it was introduced a year ago. It weighs just 4.4 pounds, has a bigger screen than the LTE's, and costs about the same, with a basic list price of $ 2,500. Storage of information is on memory cards. Also hot are the one-pound mini-machines known as palmtops or breast pocket computers made by the <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Poqet </ORGANIZATION> corporations. <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION>'s Portfolio, which operates on two AA batteries for 48 hours, fits in a jacket pocket and sells for $ 400. Not intended to rival its bigger and more expensive cousins, it has five simple built-in programs. At about $ 2,000, <ORGANIZATION> Poqet </ORGANIZATION>'s palmtop offers a bigger screen and keyboard, all within the tiny package. At the other extreme of the lightweight scale is <ORGANIZATION> Dolch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>' `` portable'' that uses <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION>'s new 80486 microprocessor, the hottest, most powerful chip in the world for personal computers. The industrial-looking <PERSON> Dolch </PERSON> weighs nearly 20 pounds, but company president <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolch </PERSON> says it can compete in performance with very high-end desktop computers and work stations. He claims it is more than twice as fast as its closest competitor, the Toshiba 5200. The potential buyers, who <PERSON> Dolch </PERSON> calls `` power users on the go,'' will pay a premium for the privilege of lugging the computer around. It ranges from about $ 13,000 to $ 18,000.

<HEAD>Delta Announces Plans to Buy $10 Billion in New Jets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it plans to buy $ 10 billion worth of new jets, including 160 of <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s new MD-90 aircraft. The orders and options announced Tuesday are in addition to $ 13 billion in plane orders announced earlier by the Atlanta-based carrier. Delta has orders and options now on a total of 519 new jets. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the new aircraft are needed to keep the carrier's fleet modern by replacing older planes and to support the airline's planned expansion in the next decade. The current fleet has an average age of 8 -LCB- years. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> will become the first customer for the MD-90, the latest in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis-based </LOCATION> aircraft maker's MD series. Delta has orders for 50 of the jets and options for another 110. The <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> jets are scheduled to be delivered beginning late in 1994. The MD-90s will be powered by <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engines </ORGANIZATION>' V2500 series engines. For <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s use, the MD-90s will seat 150 passengers. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> connection carrier in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, said it had agreed to buy up to $ 250 million worth of commercial airplanes from <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scania </ORGANIZATION>. The plans announced Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> also include orders for 50 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s and options for another 50. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> said these planes will be delivered starting in 1993. Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s machinists, however, were in the 42nd day of a strike Monday that has virtually halted production of new airplanes. The 737-300s will add to <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> fleet, which also includes 727s, 757s and 767s. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-300s will seat 120 passengers and will have <ORGANIZATION> CFM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s CFM56-3 series engines. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> said the engines for both the MD-90s and the 737s are highly fuel efficient and meet the quieter Stage III engine noise reduction standards. The investment in the aircraft includes spare engines and parts, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, speaking to a convention of bankers earlier this week, said that <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> plans considerable expansion during the 1990s and that jet purchases are a major part of the company's strategy. `` We have a tremendous amount of growth planned ahead for <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` Many of these airplanes will be used to maintain a modern fleet. To do that, of course, we have to keep replenishing our fleet and replacing our old airplanes.'' He also said the plans make <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> officials leery of any involvement in a debt-financed takeover. Delta often is mentioned as an attractive acquisition target. `` We want to be positioned to fly through a recession and to continue to grow through a recession,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` We have a big commitment to -LRB- buy new -RRB- airplanes. We can not maintain that commitment if we're heavily leveraged, particularly during a recession.''

 Stock prices retreated in sluggish trading Tuesday amid uneasiness about the economy's weakness and pessimism about the chances for lower interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 16.18 to 2,610.25. Losing issues outnumbered gaining ones by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 639 up, 831 down and 498 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 143.17 million shares, little different from Monday's total of 140.75 million. Several new reports underscored the economic slowdown, particularly in the manufacturing sector. But the statistics did n't convey a completely clear picture because they were influenced by special circumstances, analysts said. A slumping automobile market helped drive down retail sales by a full percentage point in October, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. Industrial production was crimped during the month by a strike in the aircraft industry and the impact of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake. The decline of 0.7 percent was the steepest in three years. Traders have been hoping that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> would spur growth by loosening its credit policy to a significant degree. So far, the central bank has n't made any dramatic moves. Stocks of the Big Three automakers sagged after the industry reported an unexpectedly poor sales performance. Sales of domestically made cars and light trucks skidded 20.2 percent in early November compared with a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> fell -RCB- to 43 -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> dropped -LCB- to 44 -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> was off -LRB- to 20 -LRB-. Among heavily traded blue chips, food and tobacco company <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> lost 1 -RRB- to 40 ~ on word that Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., plans to introduce a bill to bolster cigarette health warnings and sale Combustion Engineering led the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s list of actively traded issues. It declined -RRB- to 38 | as nearly 3.9 million shares changed hands Elsewhere among the actives, <PERSON> Merck </PERSON> pulled back -LCB- to 75 |, adding to Monday's loss of 3 ~ which came on news that heavy research and sales costs would hurt earnings Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 174.17 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market declined $ 11.80 billion, or 0.36 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks ended at 187.51, down 0.71. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index fell 1.94 to 385.09, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index dropped 1.56 to 337.99. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market finished at 454.03 or 1.91 points lower. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index closed at 371.52, off 0.18.

 Platinum futures prices climbed to six-month highs on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday, extending a rally that has lifted the metal's value by more than 6 percent since Nov. 3. `` It's been incredible,'' said <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON>, research director for <ORGANIZATION> Platinum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a platinum trade association. On other futures markets, gold and silver also advanced; cocoa futures plunged; energy, livestock and meat futures were lower; and grains and soybeans were mixed. Platinum futures settled $ 11.30 to $ 13.10 higher with the contract for delivery in January at $ 525.70 a troy ounce, the highest price for a near-month contract since May 15. Platinum, like gold and silver, has risen sharply in value since Oct. 13, when a 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrials average sent nervous investors scrambling for the perceived safety of precious metals. January platinum settled at $ 491.60 on Oct. 13. Analysts said Tuesday's gains reflected strong buying by both commercial and speculative traders and marked something of a return to the market by Japanese interests. `` Most of the strength came in from the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, commodities trading adviser with <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Buying also was fueled by speculation that a report due out Wednesday from London-based <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Matthey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest platinum refiner, would project a production shortfall in 1989 for the fifth year in a row
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 The report, released Wednesday morning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, projected 1989 platinum production at 3.31 million ounces and demand at 3.43 million ounces, resulting in a projected deficit of about 120,000 ounces to be filled with stockpiled supplies.

 On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold settled $ 2.20 to $ 2.40 higher with December at $ 394.90 a troy ounce; silver was 9 cents to 10.3 cents higher with December at $ 5.408 a troy ounce. Cocoa futures plunged to new 14-year lows on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on continued trade selling stemming from indications of greater availability of African-origin cocoa. Cocoa settled $ 13 to $ 40 lower with December at $ 941 per metric ton. Oil futures prices fell on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, primarily because of large supplies of gasoline in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> harbor. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> released figures showing a 4.5-million-barrel decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gasoline inventories last week, contrary to expectations for higher supplies. The API's reported increases of 2 million barrels of crude oil and 1.8 million barrels of petroleum distillates were near expectations. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 9 cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at $ 19.50 a barrel; heating oil was unchanged to .31 cent lower with December at 57.45 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .75 cent lower to .15 cent higher with December at 50.31 cents a gallon. Frozen pork bellies crashed in a technical sell-off on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with some contracts settling down the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound. Expectations for steady-to-lower cash prices prompted selling of hog and cattle futures. Live cattle settled .20 cent to .72 cent lower witih December at 74.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .70 cent lower with November at 83.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent ot .60 cent lower with December at 48.22 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.55 cents to 2 cents lower with February at 63.15 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> after a quiet session.

 <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it was planning a major shakeup in senior management, following a recent round of up to 800 layoffs, slumping profits and a weak stock price. The planned reorganization at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, the second-largest Wall Street firm behind <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, comes during a lean period throughout the securities industry. But analysts said the spotlight on <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> stemmed largely from the 61 percent ownership of the company by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which reportedly wants to reduce its stake but wants <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> to be more profitable first. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> reported third-quarter earnings of $ 66 million, but most of that came from a one-time $ 77 million pretax gain from the sale of its <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and investment banking fees from <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>' share of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s third-quarter profit was $ 41 million The company also was stung by news that its debt was being reviewed for possible downgrading and by an accounting scandal last year at its <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> money-management unit. `` American Express is probably furious,'' said <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a securities industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` With a 61 percent ownership, it's a drain on <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>' earnings. A <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said that under the reorganization the firm will promote a number of younger executives to more prominent positions and reassign others throughout the company to create a new identity for the brokerge firm. The spokesman, who asked that he not be identified, said the reorganization will occur within several weeks and will `` broaden the management and bring along a new generation to ensure the company is managed as best as possible.'' `` The process grows out of the fact that the company has grown and diversified for the past several years,'' he said. `` Do n't think of it in terms of the staff cutbacks from last week. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> began laying off some of its 38,500 employees last Monday and notified others in a two-paragraph newsletter that more across-the-board cuts were planned. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> cited, among other things, the slowdown of stock market activity since the 1987 stock market crash. The company had declined to say exactly how many employees would lose their jobs. But officials said privately that as many as 800 people, or 2 percent of the total work force, could be cut. That would be the largest staff reduction on Wall Street this year. A year ago, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> laid off about 1,200 employees. Since then it has trimmed 300 more jobs. Several other Wall Street firms also have retrenched in varying degrees this past year. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it was reviewing the firm's debt with an eye toward a possible downgrading. The credit rating agency cited increased competition in the securities business and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s use of large, sometimes risky short-term bridge loans to finance takeovers and mergers. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> stock closed up 25 cents at $ 14.62 -LCB- in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> sold the stock to the public in March 1987 at $ 34 a share and hit a low of $ 12.50 a share after the October 1987 crash. `` Clearly the firm has not been performing up to expectations and the business, which was sterengthening through the summer, has taken a turn for the worse,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckenfelder </PERSON>, a securities analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>McCaw Says it Has Lined up Financing for LIN Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly two dozen financial institutions have agreed to supply <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> with $ 3 billion to help <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> finance its offer for conmtrolling interest in <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said Tuesday that the $ 3 billion, along with approximately $ 1.2 billion of existing cash and marketable securities, provided <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> with the funding necessary to close its tender offer for 22 million shares of the New York-based concern In addition, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said it expected to receive approximately $ 1.3 billion in a separate sale of some cellular telephone assets to <ORGANIZATION> Contel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Contel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Proceeds from that sale, expected in early 1990, would go to reduce bank debt, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said in a news release. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> has been an unwelcome suitor at <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>, which has taken various steps to avoid a takeover, including agreeing to merger its cellular operations with those of <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the regional telephone company based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. In national over-the-counter trading Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> rose 37 -LCB- cents a share to $ 117 while <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> fell 75 cents a share to $ 37.25. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said 22 institutions in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> had agreed to put up the $ 3 billion requested by <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>, and that the syndicate would have put up as much as $ 7 billion. In a stormy battle, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> has been trying to buy LIN since last June. Its latest offer, on Oct. 10, was $ 125 a share for 22 million shares, which would give <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> a 50.3 percent ownership of LIN. Additionally, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s offer includes a private market value guarantee, assuring long-term stockholders of full market value for their remaining shares in five years. Shortly before <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s financing announcement Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> issued a news release saying <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> was required by <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> rules to leave its offer open for at least five business days after it announced committed financing. It said <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s offer expiration date of Nov. 17, this Friday, would not meet the five-day requirement. Efforts to reach <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> of <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION> were unsuccessful. A woman who answered the telephone in his office but refused to give her name said the company would have no comment on whether the expiration date would be extended. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> is the nation's largest cellular company, serving 45 million parties in 114 markets in 23 states. LIN has major ownership interests in cellular markets in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>.

 It's a small world, getting smaller, Fortune magazine says. Four of the top 11 products the magazine named for 1989 are small enough to fit in the pocket of a raincoat _ a video game, a camcorder, a razor and a telephone. Another is a version of a product that a couple decades ago required a separate room to store it: a computer. The list, published in the Dec. 4 issue, includes: _ Nintendo Game Boy: The paperback-sized toy plays the company's popular video game cartridges, which slip into the back of the For $ 89.95, the game with a 2 -LCB- - inch diagonal screen includes headphones, cables and the first Soviet-developed video game _ <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> CCD-TR5 Handycam: The 28-ounce device costs $ 1,500 <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> touts the 8mm camcorder for its automatic features and small size. _ <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miata </ORGANIZATION> MX-5: Waiting lists for the convertible sports car are reported at up to a year The Miata lists at $ 13,800, but <PERSON> Fortune </PERSON> said some dealers are much charging higher prices. _ `` Batman'': The <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> summer-release movie already has brought in $ 250 million in revenue, making it the fifth-largest grossing picture in history.

 <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday reported a net loss of $ 447 million for the third quarter as income from its domestic cigarette business declined. The loss compared with a net profit of $ 355 million, or $ 1.55 a share, in the third quarter of last year. The consumer products giant was taken private in October 1988 in a $ 24.53 billion leveraged buyout by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Therefore, there are no per-share figures for the latest results. Revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 was $ 3 billion, down from $ 3.2 billion a year earlier. The company said strong performances by its food and foreign tobacco businesses were more than offset by the decline in its domestic cigarette income, caused by a program to eliminate excess inventories. Inventories became inflated because of a practice known as trade loading, in which the company essentially induced wholesale customers to buy more product _ in this case cigarettes _ then they could quickly resell. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> decided earlier this year to end the practice, also used by other domestic cigarette makers and in other industries. The practice effectively overstated operating profits in <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s tobacco division by some $ 250 million in recent years, the company said. Unit sales of cigarettes have been declining in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, helping to bloat inventories that then had to be scaled back when the company decided to end the practice. `` <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> made substantial progress in the third quarter,'' Chairman <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said in a statement. `` Excluding our decision to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tobacco trade inventories, our food and tobacco businesses showed excellent earnings growth.'' <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON> said the company is ahead of schedule in its program to divest assets. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> recently announced an agreement to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ruth </ORGANIZATION>, Butterfinger and <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> candy businesses to <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for around $ 370 million. It also agreed to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> food businesses in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> to a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> company for $ 77.5 million. The latest sales brought the company close to its goal of divesting $ 5.5 billion in assets to raise cash and reduce debt amassed in the leveraged buyout. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s products include Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Winston cigarettes. Its major subsidiaries are <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Planters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LifeSavers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In the first nine months of the year, the company posted a net loss of $ 1.01 billion, compared with a net profit of $ 980 million, or $ 4.14 a share, in the same period in 1988. Nine-month revenue rose to $ 9.2 billion from $ 9.1 billion a year earlier. In line with the divestiture program, the <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> businesses have been treated as discontinued operations in both the third-quarter and nine-month results.

 The dollar fell sharply against all key currencies Tuesday while the West German mark continued to take center stage in foreign exchange. Gold prices, meanwhile, gained ground. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $ 393.30 a troy ounce, up $ 2.30 from late Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold at $ 392.50 an ounce, $ 2.40 higher. Currency dealers said continued signs of an economic slowdown in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> helped depress the dollar by renewing speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would lower interest rates. A reduction in interest rates could hurt the dollar's value. The government reported Tuesday that retail sales slipped 1 percent in October while industrial production declined 0.7 percentage point that month. Dealers, however, said that attention in the marketplace was again concentrated on cross trading as the mark continued to climb. They said the flood of East Germans into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has raised the possibility of higher inflation in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and higher interest rates there. The dollar fell to 1.8540 marks from 1.8615 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and to 1.8350 marks from 1.8615 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

It traded at 144 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and at 143.05 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, down from 143.925.

<HEAD>Downtown Biltmore Hotel Sold to Japanese Group for $219 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Biltmore Hotel, the stately downtown landmark that has hosted presidents and royalty for 66 years, has reportedly been sold to a Japanese group for $ 219 million. <ORGANIZATION> Biltmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a limited partnership that owns the 700-room hotel, agreed to sell it to T.A.T. <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a company made up of two Japanese firms, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. The two Japanese entities were not identified. Telephone calls to <ORGANIZATION> Biltmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> offices were n't returned. The Biltmore Plaza includes the recently renovated hotel and a 24-story office tower opened two years ago. T.A.T. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> will pay $ 219 million for the property, unidentified real estate sources told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The transaction was expected to be completed within 90 days, with financing provided by the <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, the report said. The Biltmore was built in 1923 for $ 10 million by a group of local businessmen. In 1927, it hosted a banquet for the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, a gathering credited with brainstorming the annual Oscar awards. <ORGANIZATION> Biltmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> bought the aging hotel in December 1984 for $ 75 million. The group has spent $ 200 million on renovations, including $ 40 million for the 130,000-square-foot office tower. Part of the overhaul converted a wing of the hotel into 235 square feet of additional office space. The deal comes on the heels of the sale of another major downtown hotel, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> and Towers, to a group of South Korean investors, including <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>. The transaction worth $ 168 million was completed two weeks ago. Meanwhile, foreign ownership of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> real estate properties has gained renewed national attention with the recent purchase by Japanese investors of Rockefeller Center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The Biltmore is managed by <ORGANIZATION> Windsor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which will continue to serve the hotel under the new owners.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a three-year $ 738 million aid package to reinforce efforts by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to discard communism and build democracy and free enterprise. The vote was 99-0. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action came on the eve of an address to a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity labor union, who is seeking a massive infusion of Western aid to energize his country's battered economy and shore up its flegling democracy. `` <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, this is for you and a free <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., immediately after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> acted `` This bill gives Solidarity a fighting chance to succeed,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> who was the bill's principal Democratic sponsor. `` Polish democracy deserves our firm support,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` To this point, our words have generally outstripped our deeds. This will help change that. `` It almost sounds trite to say that what is happening in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is mind-boggling, but thank God for it,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s work on the bill neared completion. `` We must do all we can afford, as quickly as we can, to help make these changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> irreversible,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill represents a bipartisan compromise over the scale of the aid plan, an issue that has been contentious from the start. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats originally had sought a three-year authorization level for the two East European nations of $ 989 million, while Republicans campaigned for a $ 585 million ceiling. All the proposals, including the $ 840 million authorized earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, overshadow the total $ 455 million proposed in increments over the last several months by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favors $ 738 million in aid for the two countries, White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` We're generally supportive. We'd like to get billions, if we had them.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, provided the first hard cash to back up the aid made possible by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> authorization bill. Lawmakers passed a foreign aid appropriations measure for the 1990 fiscal year that included $ 293 million for the first year of the three-year aid program, along with another $ 240 million in stand-by credit and trade insurance. Major elements of the appropriations measure included a $ 200 million grant to help stabilize <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s battered economy and $ 45 million for a private enterprise development fund. Other money would go for environmental cleanup, agriculture and educational and cultural exchanges. However, the money bill, the product of a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference, remained the subject of a veto threat over unrelated provisions which the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration opposes. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> authorization bill builds on key elements originally advocated by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, including Enterprise Funds to help both nations move away from communist centralized economies toward free-market systems. The Enterprise Funds, intended to help both countries establish free-market systems, would allocate $ 260 million for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and $ 65 million for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. In recognition of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s serious economic problems, the bill allocates $ 657 million for that country over three years. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would receive $ 81 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> compromise plan drops a $ 200 million credit stabilization plan for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> which Republicans said would only increase <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s large foreign debt. The only senator not voting for the aid plan was <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, who is ill.

 <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> declined comment Tuesday on the latest report linking broadcast and cable executive <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> to efforts to purchase the motion picture studio. The Wall Street Journal, quoting an unidentified executive close to the company, reported Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> has been in `` serious negotiations'' for three weeks to buy <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have no comment,'' <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Sando </PERSON> did n't immediately return telephone calls. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> declined comment last week on a Hollywood Reporter story that <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest cable-TV system operator, had initiated preliminary talks about a joint bid. <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> and its 54 percent-owned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> affiliate are putting together the latest bid, possibly in partnership with <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, the Wall Street Journal said. `` All we are saying is that we've been approached on the subject and we have it under study,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> Senior Vice President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> told the Wall Street Journal. A call was placed to <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, but all of the company's top executives were said to be unavailable for comment. Turner bought <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> from <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> in 1986 and later sold it back except for most of the rights to the library of <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> films. Rights to about 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> films are now considered the company's greatest asset. Turner has wanted the <LOCATION> UA </LOCATION> film library since getting control of <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>'s film library two years ago, the unidentified executive told the Wall Street Journal. `` He covets the Pink Panther and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>,'' the executive was quoted. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 1.5 billion transaction that fell apart last month.

 Savings and loan regulators undermined a securities investigation linked to the nation's largest savings and loan failure, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday at a hearing where tearful, elderly witnesses told of losing their life savings. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that a `` memorandum of understanding'' between the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, gave <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s parent company a powerful legal tool to resist the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s probe. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> was trying to determine if the parent company, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, headed by <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, millionaire <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, had filed false financial statements. However, <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said, the May 20, 1988, memorandum of understanding `` said in essence that the financial statements were all right'' and allowed <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> to argue that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation should be dropped. American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> continued to sell its subordinated debt, which has proved to be worthless, through <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s 29 branches until early this year, witnesses told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel, in the fifth of six scheduled hearings on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s collapse. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, a spokesman for the bank board, now called the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, said the memorandum `` in no way could have impeded'' the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> investigation. `` They're independent. ... There's nothing we can do to get in the way,'' he said. In sometimes tearful testimony, victims of the failure, including a partially blind widow and the mother of a brain-damaged daughter, said in large part they blamed Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., for their plight <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and four other senators are under fire for accepting large political contributions from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> before meeting on his behalf with <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators in April 1987. `` I had no idea this man could be so corrupted,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Lampel </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, widow, who testified that an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> employee eagerly offered to drive her to <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> so she could invest her life savings, $ 30,000, in the holding company's subordinated debt, which is repayable only after other debts are satisfied Because she could not see well enough to read the prospectus or the agreement she signed, Mrs. <PERSON> Lampel </PERSON> said the employee summarized it for her, but did not mention any risk or loss. Mrs. <PERSON> Lampel </PERSON> and most of the 23,000 other <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> customers who purchased $ 250 million in subordinated debt said they thought they were purchasing the equivalent of a federally insured certificate of deposit. Another victim, <PERSON> Ramona </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> employees assured her the $ 11,000 in subordinated debt she purchased was `` secured.'' The money included part of an insurance settlement paid after an automobile accident left her 23-year-old daughter brain damaged. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Flander </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, said, `` We have nothing but compassion for these people.'' `` <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> ... did n't know there had been a bond sale until he read about it newspapers after <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was closed down,'' <PERSON> Flander </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> told the committee that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> did not have enough evidence by the spring of 1988 t stop <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> from issuing the subordinated debt, but is now reexamining its policies and the law to see if changes are needed. He said he has doubled the number of staff members assigned to investigate <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. Matters related to the investigation have already been presented to a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, he said, confirming newspaper reports. In next week's <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> hearing, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, are scheduled to testify. After that, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the committee, said he intended to investigate S & amp; L scandals `` beyond <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>.'' Later, he told a reporter the probe would include the failure of <ORGANIZATION> Silverado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, on whose board <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the president's son, once served. In another development, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., who has played down his connection to <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, toured <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> real estate projects funded by <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, a trade publication said Tuesday The previously undisclosed visit in March 1987 included a helicopter trip to the Phoenician Hotel, a lavish resort then under construction by <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, and a visit to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, where the senator gave a speech to employees, the American Banker reported. The visit occured around the time that <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> was lobbying vigorously for relief from regulations that limited S & amp; Ls' direct investment in real estate and other speculative commercial ventures. <PERSON> Karolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, said the senator made the visit because <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> owned a hotel and other property in downtown <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and `` he considered them an important <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> business constituent.''

 A regional bargaining committee for striking telephone workers Tuesday agreed to endorse a framework for a settlement that could end a 14-week-old strike against <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is our hope that we can quickly resolve the remaining sticking points back at the bargaining tables,'' <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, a vice president with the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who heads the regional committee, cautioned that some remaining local issues could be stumbling blocks as serious as those resolved regionally. `` We have miles to go before we sleep,'' he said. Bargaining was to resume Wednesday. The union has agreed to a self-imposed deadline of midnight Friday for negotiating regional and local issues. Eleven committees are discussing local issues. Any tentative agreement would have be ratified by Monday, which would be the earliest time employees could come back to work. `` We are happy that we have this understanding and we feel that it is a fair settlement,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonomo </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman.

The settlement offer came out of 19 hours of weekend talks. The sticking issue for <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> union members had been the proposed shifting of health costs to workers, ranging from weekly premiums to $ 1,500 in yearly family deductibles. <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> announced Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the health benefits issue had been resolved and that the framework for a total settlement had been outlined. The settlement called for the company to assume all health benefits costs, but that was traded for the dropping of a lump-sum bonus and a profit-sharing plan. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> said the $ 388 million package would raise wages 3 percent in the first year and 1.5 percent in each of the second and third years with a cost of living allowance in each year. Some of the local issues remaining include the hiring of non-union personnel and `` concessionary demands'' by <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. Those include extending the work week on some jobs from 30 hours to 37 -LCB- hours at the same pay rate, and eliminating premium pay for overtime. One issue that appeared to be resolvable was the dismissal of 59 people during the walkout, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. Union and management leaders agreed to review those cases, he said. In addition, a committee composed of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and possibly <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> will review how to fight spiraling health costs. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said that if costs ca n't be contained, the issue will come up again when the contract expires in three years. <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said in a statement that the offer was `` a realistic solution to a very difficult set of issues facing not only our company but the entire nation.'' While negotiators met off and on for months, more than 500 acts of vandalism were reported. <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 100,000 for information on the sabotage. Last week, two telephone cables were cut, leaving up to 361,000 customers temporarily without service in southeastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. The strike delayed directory assistance, repairs and installations for <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>'s 10.5 million customers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, two cities in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> blamed a third-quarter fall in profits of 14.8 percent partly on the strike. One union member died after a confrontation Aug. 15 at a <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> office in suburban <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Police said the man jumped on the hood of a woman's car, pounded her windshield, then fell off and struck his head. The union charges the driver struck the man as she sped to work.

 Business managers across the county say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has serious trouble competing with <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and they say the problem is getting worse, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> survey. The survey, published in the November-December issue of the magazine, drew responses from about 1,150 readers. The magazine has a readership of about 200,000, with a large portion occupying high management positions at companies. `` We think this is pretty indicative of how top managers feel,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, the magazine's managing editor. About 96 percent of the respondents said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a serious competitiveness problem with its Asian rivals. Of those who said there is a problem, 85 percent said the situation is getting worse. Furthermore, just over half of the respondents said their own company has a competitiveness problem, and of those people, 83 percent said the problem is getting worse. When asked to point to a reason for the trouble, fewer than 25 percent of the respondents ranked high interest rates or federal antitrust laws as being `` very important.'' Instead, many complained about a short-term strategy taken by many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> managers, while Japanese managers take more of a long-term approach. About half of the respondents said restrictive Japanse trade practices are `` very important'' in causing competition problems.

<HEAD>Transferred Federal Employees File Suit, Seek Millions From Meredith</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A class-action lawsuit filed Tuesday on behalf of an estimated 2,000 federal employees seeks millions of dollars from <ORGANIZATION> Meredith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for allegedly cheating transferred civil servants in contracts to buy their homes. The civil suit filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by 10 federal employees and on behalf of all others in similar circumstances accuses <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> and its <ORGANIZATION> Meredith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relocation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of fraud, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, restraint of trade and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sued the Des Moines-based media and real estate company, seeking more than $ 7.7 million for similar alleged violations involving the relocation of government employees. The class-action suit was filed because the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it could not represent individual federal employees with claims against <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, a partner of <ORGANIZATION> Sprenger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Land, a law firm with offices in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> that specializes in such litigation. `` Our suit is intended to compensate the employees for what they lost,'' she said. <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> is best known for its Better Homes and Gardens and Ladies' Home Journal magazines. Its relocation service also is known as Better Homes and Gardens Family Relocation Service. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> spokesman, said the company stood by a statement denying wrongdoing that it issued Oct. 25, after the federal government filed its suit. In that statement, <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> said it believed its relocation service acted properly. <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>, which laid off 30 workers at offices in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> when the contract was canceled a year early, has its own $ 6 million claim pending against the federal government. Under a two-year contract signed in May 1986 with the federal <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> agreed to buy homes and perform other relocation services for transferred federal workers in 24 central and Western states. The government estimated the value of the contract at $ 103.3 million. The contract was canceled after one year following a government audit that the government said disclosed <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> intimidated appraisers to lower the valuations of federal employees' homes. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> claims that efforts by <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> to obtain lower appraisals resulted in delays in the sales of the homes, forcing employees into accepting distressed prices. The class-action suit makes similar claims. It seeks unspecified actual and punitive damages.

 Automakers and proponents of electrically powered vehicles touted their wares Tuesday and predicted a future when motorists will charge up rather than fill their tanks. About 200 people, including representatives of two major American auto manufacturers, gathered to gawk at and drive prototypes of the first electric vehicles to be produced in conjuction with the American car industry. One vehicle, the G-Van, which will be marketed by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is scheduled to begin production next year. Another vehicle, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s TEVan, is expected to be available in 1992 or 1993. The conference was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the research and development arm of the electric utility industry, which also helped developed the two vehicles. From the outside, the electric vans look like their petroleum-powered counterparts and their proponents claim they handle like gasoline-powered vans as well. But instead of a conventional engine and gears, the electric vans operate on a battery-driven motor that can be recharged by plugging into an electrical outlet. `` We do n't want to suggest this is going to turn around overnight, but we think it will provide an alternative,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Balzhiser </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which has been working on electrically powered vehicles since 1979. Despite progress, the driving range of the electric vehicles remains limited when compared to conventional automobiles. In the G-Van, for example, which is expected to sell initially for about $ 32,500, the lead-acid battery will run for about 60 miles without recharging. The TEVan, which has no suggested retail price as yet, will use a nickel-iron battery and have a range of about 120 miles. Both batteries will take about eight hours to recharge, manufacturers said. The top speed for the G-Van is about 52 miles per hour, while the TEVan will top off at about 65, the designers said. Instead of the growl of conventional engines, the electric car produces a low hum. `` After the initial shock of the different noises, everything is basically the same,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Chloride </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the companies involved in manufacturing the G-Van. `` People get a little bit thrown when they touch the gas pedal and they're waiting for the engine to rev.'' Electric industry officials were ready with a laundry list of reasons why Americans should push development of the vehicles. Besides the fact that it would open a vast new market for electric power, experts said electric vehicles would reduce emissions that threaten the environment with ozone and carbon monoxide. Replacing 1 million gasoline cars with electric cars would cut down emissions by 150 million tons a year, said <PERSON> Balzhiser </PERSON>. A car that runs without gasoline also could reduce the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' dependence on foreign oil imports, since electricity can be generated through several means, including hydro, coal and nuclear power, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deegan </PERSON>, a senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Penstar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, estimated electric vehicles would corner 10 to 20 percent of the market for commercial vehicles by the second half of the 1990s. Response to the cars from conference participants varied greatly. `` The most promising stage of electric vehicles for commercial use that I've seen in the 25 years I've been in the business is this,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Wouk </PERSON>, an electric vehicle consultant from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They seem to have solved the major problems that existed in the past.'' But <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reedy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> said his utility had no immediate plans to buy any. `` We have some skepticism,'' he said. `` We've had some electric vehicles in our service areas before and they have n't really performed adequately. We're just waiting to see how all this shakes itself out.'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mader </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said he was optimistic about future sales. He said the corporation has received orders for 185 electric vehicles since September, when it began soliciting business from 600 utilities across the country.

 Two Japanese industry groups are sending a trade mission to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to promote purchases of American-made semiconductors, the groups announced Wednesday. About 85 representatives of about 40 Japanese companies will participate in the 10-day mission, which begins Dec. 6, the <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor makers have charged that they have not been allowed equal access to the Japanese market and that Japanese companies have not done enough to promote purchases of foreign semiconductor chips. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group, said last week that Japanese companies and government agencies have begun making serious efforts in recent months to increase sales of foreign chips. Foreign semiconductors account for about 11.2 percent of the Japanese market, far short of a 20 percent goal mentioned in negotiations for a 1986 U.S.-Japan semiconductor agreement. The trade mission will begin with three days of meetings with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> suppliers in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, followed by visits to factories, the <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. The Japanese mission follows a semiconductor sales mission to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last June sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> last week offered to share information about high-definition television with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor makers to allow them to produce chips for a Japanese-developed HDTV system.
